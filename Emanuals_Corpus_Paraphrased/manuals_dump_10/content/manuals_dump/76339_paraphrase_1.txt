**Paraphrased Text:**

Typically, white items such as clothing, towels, tablecloths, and sheets should be washed separately from colored items to maintain their whiteness. It is important to wash new colored items before mixing them with whites. For optimal results, pillowcases and other laundry can be pre-treated according to the instructions provided in care charts. Avoid overloading the washing machine; synthetic fabrics mixed with heavier items can diminish cleaning effectiveness.

Stubborn stains on bathroom textiles or tablecloths may require specialized treatment. Fresh stains should be treated immediately, while grease stains can be soaked overnight in a suitable detergent. For whites and colored items, a gentle bleach treatment can be beneficial; however, always follow specific guidelines for applying bleach. Items like shirts made from synthetic fabrics might require a different approach for stain removal.

The selection of the wash cycle and temperature (ideally 60°C) is crucial, including the use of any added cleaning agents. Always refer to water classification guidelines based on your local regulations. Ensure the washing machine is disconnected from the power supply when performing maintenance or cleaning tasks.

For standard operation, it’s critical to refer to the manufacturer’s instructions regarding cleaning the internal components of the machine, particularly the inlet and outlet hoses. Regular cleaning should prevent blockages and maintain performance. In case of issues, follow the troubleshooting guidelines, which might include checking hoses for obstructions or leaks.

When reconnecting hoses or preparing for emergency draining, ensure that all connections are tight and screen for any debris that could affect water flow. If temperatures drop below freezing, take precautions to protect hoses from freezing damage. 

Should you need assistance, contacting customer service for technical support and guidance is advisable. Follow all safety protocols when operating and maintaining your washing machine to avoid accidents.
