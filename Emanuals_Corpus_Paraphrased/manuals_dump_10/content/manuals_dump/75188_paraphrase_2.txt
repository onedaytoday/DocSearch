### Setting the Clock and Timer  

When power is restored or initially set up, you will need to set the clock. To do this, press the appropriate button and adjust to the desired time, confirming with START or CANCEL as necessary.

### Baking Instructions  

For optimal baking, preheat the oven to your desired temperature between 170°F and 550°F. Allow sufficient space between racks and ensure proper air circulation around baking items. 

For more detailed procedures or troubleshooting, consult the common issues section of this manual.

**COOK TIME** enables the oven to automatically cook for a specified duration. The timer countdown is displayed, and the oven will turn off when it reaches zero. This feature is compatible with Convection, Warm, Defrost, Proof, and Perfect cooking modes. For conventional cooking at 450°F, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press BAKE, then COOK OPTIONS to choose the desired settings. Press COOK TIME, followed by START, to initiate heating. You can cancel or adjust the cooking time at any point. **END TIME** functions similarly, allowing the oven to shut off after a predetermined period, also displaying countdown information. Various cooking options available include Convection, Warm, Defrost, Clean, and more.

When using **Broiling**, it’s essential to be cautious as it involves high temperatures suitable for thick cuts of meat. Preheat the oven to between 300°F and 550°F. Ensure the food is turned during cooking for even results, keeping in mind the risk of grease ignition. 

In **Convection Baking**, this mode allows for consistent heat distribution at temperatures between 170°F and 550°F (recommended at 350°F). Preheating is crucial and should be done correctly to enhance cooking efficiency.

The **Convection Convert** function adjusts the cooking temperatures automatically, reducing by 25°F in Convection mode. Preheat appropriately before cooking.

For **Convection Roasting**, this method is ideal for meats and poultry, allowing for dry heat to circulate evenly. Keep watch for potential grease flare-ups. Recommended roasting temperatures are similarly set between 170°F and 550°F.

With **KEEP WARM**, the oven maintains finished food at a safe temperature (150°F to 190°F) to keep it warm until serving.

**SLOW COOK** provides a steady low-temperature cooking method (HI or LO), ideal for larger cuts, ensuring that food does not burn. 

**DEHYDRATING** uses low-level heat to remove moisture from food items, operating between 100°F and 225°F. Always preheat and adjust times based on the thickness and type of food being processed.

**DEFROSTING** allows for gentle thawing of food items without cooking them, displaying active status on the panel to avoid bacteria growth. Always monitor closely during the process.

### Dough Proofing  
Proofing bread involves activating the yeast in your dough. The optimal temperature for proofing is between 85°F and 100°F. **Proofing Tips:** Preheat the oven to the lowest setting to warm the oven cavity. Allow it to reach a temperature of 100°F, using either the Upper or Lower Oven settings. Once set, press the BREAD PROOF button and start the process. You can cancel the function at any time. While the proofing function is active, if necessary, press to select either the Upper or Lower Oven options and press HI, followed by START.

### Perfect Turkey  
Achieving the perfect turkey requires precise cooking. The temperature range for cooking is 170°F to 550°F, with an ideal setting around 325°F. **Perfect Turkey Tips:** Thaw the turkey for at least several hours before cooking and preheat the oven. Ensure that the turkey is securely placed in a roasting pan that catches grease for easier cleanup. Select either the Upper or Lower Oven settings and press the PERFECT TURKEY button to initiate cooking. Optionally, you can use the PROBE feature to monitor the internal temperature. Press START once the desired temperature is reached, and use CANCEL when finished.

### Temperature Probe  
The temperature probe allows for accurate internal temperature measurement of various foods, ensuring they are properly cooked. This feature works with both Convection Cooking and the Perfect settings. The probe can measure temperatures from 130°F to 210°F, ideally around 170°F. **IMPORTANT:** Ensure the probe is used correctly, inserted into the thickest part of the meat without touching bone. Thaw food completely before cooking to avoid burns, and always verify the temperature readings.

### Multi-Stage Cooking  
The Multi-Stage feature allows for multiple cooking modes, accommodating up to three cooking settings with various methods such as Convection and Proofing. Select the desired cooking stages one by one. Choose either the Upper or Lower Oven, press MULTI STAGE, and follow prompts for each stage, pressing START to commence cooking. If you need to cancel, you can do so at any stage by pressing CANCEL.

### User Preferences  
The user preferences section allows for customization of various settings including clock options and temperature measurements. To access preferences, press USER PREF, navigate through the options, and adjust settings. You can set the clock to display the time of day, and toggle between 12-hour or 24-hour formats as required. 

### Audio Control  
This feature allows you to operate the oven silently when necessary. Press USER PREF to toggle sound options on or off. You can also set continuous baking or energy-saving options.

### Resetting to Factory Settings  
To return to factory defaults, including turning the clock back on, resetting temperature settings, and restoring other features, press USER PREF and select the reset option. Follow prompts to confirm and reset the oven.

### My Favorites  
The My Favorites function stores your preferred cooking settings in memory, allowing quick access. Programmable for up to three settings, simply select either Upper or Lower Oven, press MY FAVORITE, and start the cooking process. You can overwrite existing favorites by selecting the option and pressing START.

### Sabbath Feature  
The Sabbath feature is designed for Jewish holidays, enabling the oven to maintain a set temperature (around 350°F) without interruption. Once activated, the oven can operate continuously without sound or be temporarily turned off. Only the BAKE function is usable while the feature is active. Follow specific instructions for setting COOK TIME if needed during this period.

### SABBATH FEATURE (CONTINUED)

To initiate the Sabbath feature, start by pressing the UPPER OVEN and selecting OVEN BAKE at 425°F, then press START twice. To turn the oven off, press CANCEL. The oven can be set to automatically turn off after a certain period. Both HI and LO settings should be pressed for a minimum of seconds when turning off. 

### USING THE SELF-CLEAN FEATURE

**Cleaning Precautions:**
- Allow the oven to cool before cleaning.
- Wear appropriate protective gear when manually cleaning.
- Ensure children are kept away during the self-cleaning process, which operates at high temperatures. 
- Avoid the use of cleaners or abrasive coatings during self-cleaning.

**Self-Cleaning Process:**
- For cleaning, remove larger food particles with a damp cloth, as high heat will effectively incinerate excess residue. Do not place items that can’t withstand high temperatures directly in the self-cleaning chamber.
- Begin the self-cleaning cycle by selecting either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, pressing CLEAN, and choosing the duration of the cycle (LIGHT, MEDIUM, or HEAVY). Then press START. The door will lock automatically, and the cleaning cycle typically lasts around an hour.
- After the cycle completes, the door will remain locked until the oven cools. You can cancel the process if necessary.

### GENERAL CLEANING 

Perform regular cleanings when the oven is cool. Immediately address any spills or heavy soiling to minimize the need for extensive cleanings later. For painted and decorative surfaces, use a mild cleaner and a soft cloth to avoid scratching. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scrubbing pads, as they can damage the surface.

### OVEN LIGHT 

The oven light is controlled by a switch and must be in place whenever the oven is being used. Ensure the oven is cool before cleaning the glass shield that covers the light. 

### BROILER PAN CLEANING TIPS 

After use, promptly clean the broiler pan to prevent grease build-up. Avoid covering the pan while broiling and clean it regularly.

### ADDITIONAL TIPS

When using the oven, especially for baking, avoid overcrowding or preheating too high. Allow for proper clearance and refer to provided charts to ensure optimal results.

### COMMON ISSUES AND TROUBLESHOOTING

If an error code appears, press CANCEL to reset the system. For non-operational issues, ensure the oven is properly connected to the power supply and consult an authorized service technician if problems persist. 

For excessive smoking or uneven cooking, check the positioning of meat during broiling, preheat properly, and ensure that the oven is not overloaded to prevent poor baking results. 

Always keep the oven free of excess grease to minimize smoking and ensure efficient cooking.
