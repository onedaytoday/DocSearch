### IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
These instructions are essential for your safety and proper operation of the appliance. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Customer Service. The appliance is heavy; use caution during handling. Ensure it meets the specifications outlined and does not have any exposure to excessive heat or moisture. Whenever moving the appliance, follow the specified instructions. Allow the appliance to rest for a few hours after transportation to stabilize its components. Compatibility with high voltage environments is vital as it may affect performance. 

Keep the back of the unit clear of obstructions to ensure proper air circulation. Do not allow children to tamper with the appliance to prevent hazards. Be cautious of potential suffocation risks from packaging materials. The cooling system needs to be serviced by authorized technicians to maintain safety. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight or near heat sources.

Food storage recommendations should be followed to prevent frostbite or freezer burn. Any items stored should be done according to the advised guidelines to maintain food quality. Unopened bottles may burst if frozen; ensure appropriate handling. 

Before cleaning, turn off the appliance and disconnect from the power supply. Only authorized personnel should perform servicing to prevent injuries or malfunctions. 

### DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLIANCE
The appliance includes separate compartments for fresh food and frozen food.

### OPERATION
To start the appliance, set the thermostat to the desired temperature (generally around -18°C). The indicator light will show the current status. Adjust the thermostat based on food storage needs; higher settings correspond to warmer temperatures.

The red warning light will activate if the internal temperature exceeds -12°C, indicating that the food may be at risk. An acoustic signal will remind you to take action when necessary.

For optimal food preservation, manually activate fast-freezing to quickly cool fresh items. Once fully frozen, allow some time—usually a few hours—before removing or shifting items. Preserve air circulation to maintain quality and ensure freshness.

### DEFROSTING
If frost builds up, it should be managed effectively. Turn off the appliance to facilitate the defrosting process. Use towels to absorb melting water and ensure thorough cleaning afterward. Restore temperature settings once completed.

### MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING
Always disconnect from the electrical supply before cleaning. Only authorized technicians should conduct servicing because the unit requires specialized handling. Clean surfaces with appropriate materials; avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive products that can damage the interior.

### TROUBLESHOOTING
