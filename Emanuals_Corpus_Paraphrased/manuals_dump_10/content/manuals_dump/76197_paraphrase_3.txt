Once the unit is securely mounted to the wall, ensure that it is positioned slightly higher than the designated template. Proper alignment is crucial for the cooker, with screws located at the front. Each screw should be fastened to the security fittings provided.

If any resistance occurs during closing, adjust the friction assembly indicated by the "V" to allow for a smoother operation. Ensure that the unit is easy to access during cleaning or servicing, as it may be heavy and require proper support underneath.
