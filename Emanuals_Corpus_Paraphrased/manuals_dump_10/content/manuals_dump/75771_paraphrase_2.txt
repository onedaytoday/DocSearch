**IQ-Touch™ Overview**  
The IQ-Touch™ feature facilitates the management of settings in alignment with religious practices within the community. To activate or deactivate the system, hold the designated button for several seconds. The display will indicate whether Sabbath mode is in effect, which is intended for health-related considerations. If activated, the system generates sound notifications. Once deactivated, the system returns to its normal function without requiring further input. For additional guidance, please visit http://www.star-k.org.

**Power Management**  
It's important to note that certain lights may remain off during the Sabbath. System recovery occurs automatically. The Perfect™ function should be disengaged before utilizing IQ-Touch™ settings. To turn off the Perfect™ feature, press the dedicated on/off button. Once turned off, proceed to manage the IQ-Touch™ settings. If the Perfect™ feature has been switched off, ensure to reconnect the power supply within a span of a few hours to allow thorough operation. This ensures the unit operates correctly for at least three hours after being cleared from previous settings. Typically, it takes about four hours for full recovery.

**Operation Instructions**  
For the system to function effectively, both power supplies must remain operational. In case the system makes noises like chattering while lifting or lowering, address the issue by adjusting the settings. If the power supply is interrupted, ensure the arm is appropriately managed.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
When cleaning, avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. Use a soft cloth for routines involving the IQ-Touch™ interface. Should you encounter any difficulties, refer to the user manual for detailed maintenance instructions.

**Shelf Features**  
Please be aware that shelves designed for fresh food are engineered to prevent clutter and maintain optimal cooling efficiency. Position items appropriately for best airflow. For meats and other sensitive items, use the dedicated sections that provide higher humidity as needed.

**Food Storage Recommendations**  
To avoid overcrowding and ensure proper cooling, store food items air-tight. For effective freezing and defrosting, make sure to adhere to temperature settings between 28°F and 42°F. Press the F/C button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius as required.

**Sound Alerts**  
Normal operational sounds may include hissing or clicking as part of the cooling cycle. These sounds are generally indicative of correct functioning. Regular sounds may be generated during defrosting or access to the water manifold—these are part of standard operation.

**Cleaning and Cartridge Replacement**  
The PureAdvantage™ water filtration system should be replaced every six months for optimal performance. To install or replace the cartridge, follow the instructions carefully, ensuring the housing is clear of obstructions.

**Warranty and Product Care**  
To maintain the integrity of your appliance, refrain from using abrasive cleaners, scouring pads, or products that could scratch surfaces, as this could invalidate the warranty. For additional support or parts inquiries, refer to the manufacturer's website.

### Cleaning and Maintenance Instructions 

**General Cleaning and Precautions**  
To maintain the dishwasher and prevent residue buildup, regularly clean the interior with a soft cloth. For short vacations (up to three months), remove perishable items. Ensure the power is turned off before disconnecting the food storage or cooling sections. To prevent scratches, avoid wringing out the cloth too forcefully and use non-abrasive cleaners. When cleaning surfaces, avoid bleach-based household cleaners unless specifically instructed. 

**LED Lighting Maintenance**  
The appliance includes LED lights for fresh food storage. To maintain the lighting system, carefully unscrew and clean around the LED covers, ensuring the lights face the proper direction (either towards the fresh food compartment or outward). Always use protective equipment when working with electrical components.

**Common Troubleshooting Concerns**  
1. **LED Light Not Illuminating**: If the light is not on, check if it is properly connected. Inspect the circuit supply and ensure it is seated correctly. If necessary, clean the lights and inspect for obstructions or food that may block the light from functioning.
   
2. **Too Cold Settings**: If items are freezing, check that the cooling function hasn't been inadvertently activated. Ensure air circulation is not restricted within the appliance, as that can affect performance.

3. **Water or Frost Buildup**: Excess moisture can accumulate if items are not placed properly or if the appliance is left in humid conditions. Regularly clean and check the sealing of compartments to reduce moisture buildup.
