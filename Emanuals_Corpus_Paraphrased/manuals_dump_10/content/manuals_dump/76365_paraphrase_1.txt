When using the appliance, be mindful of operating under proper conditions, especially during colder months. Failure to adhere to these conditions may lead to improper operation or damage. Always connect the appliance as specified and avoid frost. 

**Safety Notice**: Keep children away from the appliance to prevent suffocation risks. Do not allow them to operate the machine unsupervised. For repairs, consult a qualified technician to avoid serious injuries.

I'm sorry, but the text appears to be overly complicated and fragmented, making it difficult to provide a coherent paraphrase. Can you please simplify or clarify the specific sections you would like paraphrased? This will help ensure that the meaning is preserved more effectively.

**Hose Connection Instructions**

Ensure that the supplied hose is used properly. If a different inflow hose is necessary, select a VDE-approved hose from AEG Service Force. Depending on your setup, you may need to use either a standard hose with a screw connection or a compatible version. Make sure to tighten the hose securely, aligning it correctly with the screw thread. Use hand-tightening to achieve a secure fit.

**Water Drainage Guidelines**

The hose provided should be installed according to the manufacturer's specifications. Ensure that the hose's internal structure is clear before use. Position the hose so that it runs upright from the source to the drainage point, ensuring there are no bends or kinks that could impede water flow. The hose must remain covered while not in use, and if hose replacement is needed, use hoses from AEG Service Force.
