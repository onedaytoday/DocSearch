**Preventive Measures and Solutions for Potential Washer Issues**

**Possible Causes:**
- **Bleach Issues:** Undiluted bleach applied directly, inadequate quantity, or incorrect type may lead to undesirable results, including tears and damage to threads.
- **Using the Washer Incorrectly:** Insufficient water levels or incorrect settings can cause static attraction, particularly with synthetic items or overly greasy fabrics. 
- **Undissolved Detergents:** Non-phosphate detergents may not dissolve properly, leading to residue build-up on items. 
- **Iron or Heater Issues:** Problems with the water supply or malfunctioning heater can contribute to these issues. 
- **Overloading the Washer:** Overloading can cause noise, such as clicking or thumping sounds. 

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **For Bleach Issues:** If damage occurs, rewash with the appropriate amount of diluted bleach. Consider using a prewash treatment to address stains or tears effectively.
2. **Static and Grease:** Sort items appropriately before washing. Ensure that you are using enough water and the right type of detergent.
3. **Machine Maintenance:** Clean the washer interior regularly. Use a cloth to wipe down the surfaces and ensure all connections are secure. Check hoses for build-up and replace them as needed.
4. **Noise Issues:** If unusual sounds occur, redistribute items in the washer or reduce load capacity. If the washer overheats, cool it down and ensure proper ventilation.
5. **Water Supply:** Confirm that all water supply hoses are fully connected and operational. Maintain a water temperature of at least 120°F (49°C).
