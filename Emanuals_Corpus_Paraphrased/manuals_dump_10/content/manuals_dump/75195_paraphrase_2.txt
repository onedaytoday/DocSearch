### GRILL PAN AND HANDLE

To ensure proper positioning of the grill pan and handle, tilt the handle slightly upwards while securing it in place. For optimal cooking, place the food on the designated shelf so that it faces the front. This setup allows for better heat exposure, which is crucial for even cooking. Position the food according to its thickness to achieve desired results. Foods such as meats should be turned as needed during cooking, and preheating is recommended for toasting. Adjust the heat and shelf placement as necessary.

### GRILLING CHART

Refer to the following chart for recommended cooking times and placements on the shelves, counting from the top downwards.

- **Rashers**: High Shelf
- **Chops**: High Shelf
- **Whole Trout**: High Shelf
- **Browning Gratin, Shepherd's Pie**: High Shelf

### FAN-ASSISTED TOP OVEN

This oven type is ideal for cooking various foods, providing even heat distribution. Refer to the Top Cooking Chart for guidelines. 

**Using the Fan-Assisted Oven**: Turn the Selector clockwise to activate the function. 

**Important Notes**: The Selector controls the operation, including cooling and power. Ensure the oven shelves are adjusted correctly for best results.

### HINTS AND TIPS

Set the oven to temperatures of 80°C to 100°C for optimal performance. Position food centrally on the shelves to enhance cooking efficiency, especially for items like Yorkshire puddings or cakes. When required, utilize the bottom shelf for foods needing less heat. Preheated cooking generally results in better outcomes. Emphasize cleanliness to ease post-cooking maintenance.

### TOP OVEN COOKING CHART

The following chart provides cooking temperatures and shelf positions for various foods:

- **Meringues**: Shelf Position 1, Temp: 10°C
- **Shortbread**: Shelf Position 2, Temp: 10°C

### THERMAL GRILLING IN THE TOP OVEN

The thermal grilling function allows for cooking items typically associated with grilling by circulating hot air around the food for even cooking. This method can reduce cooking times for dishes like shepherd’s pie and gratins.

**Using Thermal Grilling**: Activate the thermal setting with the door closed.

### MAIN FAN OVEN

The fan oven is essential for even cooking and typically requires preheating to reach the necessary temperature.

**Preheating**: Ensures the oven reaches optimal temperatures for baking or roasting.

**Cooking Temperatures**: Adhere to the recommended charts, adjusting by 20°C to 25°C as needed.

### BATCH BAKING

Utilize the proper shelf positions to optimize baking results for multiple items at once.

### TO FIT THE MAIN OVEN SHELVES

Ensure that shelf placement is correct, with units vertical and aligned with the back for best heat circulation.

### HINTS AND TIPS

To enhance cooking, maintain spacing between shelves to allow heat to circulate freely. Adjust as needed to avoid excessive browning and facilitate even cooking. Use materials like enamelware for improved browning while minimizing cleaning efforts.

### Hints and Tips

To enhance browning, consider the material of your cookware. Enamelware, heavy-duty, or non-stick options facilitate better browning, while glass or polished trays absorb heat less effectively. Ensure food is placed centrally for optimal results. If cooking time needs adjustment, increase the temperature by an additional 10°C.
