The cold storage system features coolers operating at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C, constructed with notable thickness and incorporating built-in components. These three coolers utilize pre-charged cooling technology, requiring expertise in assembly and installation. They employ a new injection method for enhanced performance, along with high-quality pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free from CFCs and HCFCs. The internal design includes rounded corners for optimal airflow and ease of cleaning. Fast-fit technology ensures an airtight seal using high-grade PVC materials, compatible with both high and low ambient conditions (up to +43°C) and refrigerants like R404A.

For effective defrosting, a heated system is integrated to minimize frost buildup, complemented by internal lighting rated IP54. The cooler is equipped with an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting control, and a thermostat. The door features a right-hinge design supported by smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring an airtight closure with superior insulation properties, thereby reducing operational costs.

The equipment complies with HACCP standards and accompanying accessories include: aluminum shelves with varying dimensions, a door microswitch, a graphic temperature recorder kit, advanced connections for cold rooms, and plastic curtains for doors with a 65 cm clearance. Options for HACCP and basic version printers are also available, alongside models such as CR24N120R, CR24N140R, and HFBB050, with specific configurations like CR28N140R where applicable.
