By adhering to these guidelines and understanding the tractor's functionalities, you can operate it safely and effectively.

**IMPORTANT**: To maintain proper function, it is essential to clean the battery and terminals regularly. Start by disconnecting the negative (black) terminal followed by the positive (red) terminal from the tractor. Clean the battery and terminals thoroughly, ensuring they are bright and free of corrosion. Apply grease to the terminals for protection. Refer to the "Replacing Battery" section in the Service and Adjustments guide for additional details.

**Engine Lubrication**: Use high-quality motor oil rated for API service categories SG through SL. Choose an SAE viscosity grade suitable for the expected operational temperatures; for example, use SAE 5W-30 or 10W-30 in colder weather, as viscosity varies with temperature.

**Oil Change Notice**: Change the engine oil after a specified number of hours of operation or at least once a season. Ensure the tractor is stationary and that the crankcase is securely fastened.

**Air Filter Maintenance**: Clean the air filter every few hours of operation or as needed to prevent overheating due to buildup. Also, clean the air screen to maintain optimal airflow.

**Starter and Brake Safety**: To prevent injury during service, disengage the clutch/brake and set the gearshift to neutral (N). Disconnect the battery before performing any service or adjustments.

**Mower Installation**: When reattaching the mower, ensure it is securely mounted on the chassis. Adjust the mower height correctly for even cutting across the ground.

**Brake Adjustment**: Check the brake and clutch function periodically. If adjustments are needed, follow the specific procedures provided in the service manual.

**Drive Belt Replacement**: When replacing the motion drive belt, ensure all previous components are removed, and re-install the belt in the correct orientation.

**Steering Wheel Alignment**: To adjust the steering wheel, ensure it is aligned properly. Front wheel toe-in and camber adjustments should be made as necessary.

**Battery and Electrical Maintenance**: If the battery becomes weak, follow safety precautions when jump-starting. Disconnect and reconnect the cables in the correct order to avoid short circuits.

**Headlight and Electrical Component Replacement**: Ensure to use automotive-grade fuses and components when replacing electrical elements.

**General Maintenance**: Regularly inspect and clean the tractor to prolong its life. This includes checking for rust, worn parts, and ensuring all fasteners are tight.
