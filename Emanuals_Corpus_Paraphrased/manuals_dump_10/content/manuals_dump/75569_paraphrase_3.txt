### The Bridge Cooktop Operations

**Overview of the Cooktop:**
The Bridge function, located at the front of the cooktop, is designed to enhance cooking with various cookware types. It is essential to operate the Bridge correctly for optimal heating. When using cookware, ensure the Bridge is engaged to improve heat distribution.

**Operating Instructions:**
To activate the Bridge, rotate the controls either counterclockwise to decrease or clockwise to increase the heat. It is crucial to follow these steps accurately to avoid overheating or damaging your cookware. After cooking, switch the Bridge to the OFF position; the indicator light will illuminate until the cooktop cools down.

**Cookware Recommendations:**
Different cookware types affect cooking performance. Options include:
- **Aluminum:** Conducts heat well, but can scratch easily.
- **Copper:** Heats rapidly, but requires careful handling.
- **Stainless Steel:** Easy to clean, offers good heating capabilities.
- **Cast Iron:** Retains heat effectively once preheated, suitable for high temperatures.
- **Porcelain-Enamel Metal:** Designed to resist scratches, but not ideal for all surfaces.
- **Glass:** Not recommended for high-heat applications as it can scratch.

Ensure there’s adequate space around cookware for heat circulation, allowing food to cook evenly.

**Preheating and Temperature Selection:**
The cooktop requires preheating, especially for baking and broiling. Adjust the oven rack while the oven is cool, and select appropriate positions for different cooking tasks like roasting or baking. Always monitor the temperature to avoid undercooking or overcrowding, which can lead to uneven heat distribution.

**Use of Warmer:**
The Warmer feature is designed to keep food at optimal temperatures. Arrange food items upright on the warming rack. It is recommended to cover food for efficient heating. When using the Warmer, avoid direct contact with heating elements to prevent burns.

**Safety and Maintenance:**
To prevent grease fires, do not leave cooking unattended and have a fire extinguisher nearby. After cooking, clean spills immediately to maintain the cooktop's appearance. Regular cleaning minimizes the need for extensive cleaning later.

**Cleaning Guidelines:**
Allow the cooktop to cool before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaners and avoid abrasive materials that can scratch the surface. For tough stains, it’s best to use specialized cleaning products. Always follow manufacturer instructions for care and maintenance to ensure longevity.

By adhering to these protocols, you can ensure safe and efficient cooking while maintaining the condition of your cooktop.

**Self-Cleaning Features and Maintenance Instructions**

The self-cleaning function operates at high temperatures, effectively eliminating or significantly reducing stubborn stains. Ensure the oven cools down before initiating cleaning, and wear protective gear during manual cleaning. Avoid contact with the hot surfaces and do not use the self-cleaning feature when certain items, like food with high moisture, are inside, as they can withstand the high heat required for cleaning. Wait for the oven to cool completely before cleaning the cavity or using damp cloths.

For safe operation, monitor the oven during the cleaning cycle, as it reaches temperatures that can cause burns. Always keep the glass shield in place while the oven is in use. Make sure the oven is cool before you attend to the light or service components. Follow designated cleaning protocols and avoid using rough materials that could scratch the surfaces, maintaining optimal performance and longevity of the oven.

In case of service needs, refer to the warranty which covers manufacturing defects or issues arising under normal use. Damage caused by misuse or unauthorized repair is not covered. For warranty claims or service inquiries, please contact the provided service number. This warranty is valid only in the USA and includes specific rights that may vary by state.

For troubleshooting, if the oven displays operational errors (F1, F2, F3, or F9), press STOP/CLEAR and consult an authorized service provider. Ensure proper cookware is used, as lightweight or warped items can lead to uneven heating. Maintain necessary clearances and avoid obstruction by cabinetry or carpets.
