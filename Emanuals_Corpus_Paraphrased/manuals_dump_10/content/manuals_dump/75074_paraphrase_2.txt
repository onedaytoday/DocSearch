**Installation Instructions for Microwave Mounting and Electrical Grounding**

Begin by thoroughly reviewing these instructions for inspectors, including guidelines for mounting and electrical grounding. This guide ensures proper alignment and significant details for consumer reference.

1. **Microwave Mounting**:
   - The microwave should be installed above the range under the cabinet, with a minimum clearance specified by the manufacturer. 
   - Make sure to read all instructions prior to installation to ensure compliance with warranty conditions.
   - Ensure the installation site is suitable in terms of wall material—use appropriate spacers for plaster or drywall if necessary.

2. **Electrical Grounding**:
   - The microwave must be properly grounded according to national safety standards. Neglecting this can result in electrical shock. 
   - **WARNING**: Do not adjust or remove the grounding pin from the plug, and avoid using extension cords. 
   - Ensure the power outlet is accessible at the installation site as shown.

3. **Ductwork Considerations**:
   - If ductwork is needed, ensure it is securely attached and properly sized for airflow. Use the correct configurations for transitions (rectangular to round if required).
   - Follow the specified measurements and calculations to ensure optimal air movement.

4. **Hardware Installation**:
   - Gather and verify all installation hardware: screws, washers, and brackets as outlined.
   - Follow steps (A) to (D) for mounting the microwave starting from the back assembly, ensuring each step is clearly executed.

5. **Oven Type Selection**:
   - Ensure that the correct installation type is followed based on whether the microwave is vented or non-vented. 
   - The charcoal filter needs to be replaced periodically for effective recirculation and must be installed following the designated procedures.

6. **Final Installation Steps**:
   - Adhere to all mounting instructions found in wall and cabinet templates. Follow these instructions precisely for a secure installation.
   - Review the installation hardware list to ensure all required components are present before proceeding with mounting.

By following these guidelines, the installation will comply with safety standards and function effectively. 

**Contact Information for Assistance**:
If there are any questions or issues with the installation, please consult a qualified service technician or contact the manufacturer's support for further guidance.
