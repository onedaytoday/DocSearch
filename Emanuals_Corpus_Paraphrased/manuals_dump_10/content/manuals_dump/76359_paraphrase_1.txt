### Hose Installation Instructions

Ensure the proper connection of the supplied inflow hose. If using hoses from AEG Service Force, verify secure attachment using the hose screw. Tighten the hose properlyâ€”either by hand or with a tool, ensuring the screw threads align correctly (in inches). Follow the provided operational instructions.

### Water Drainage Guidelines

The drainage hose must be installed as directed. It is crucial that the internal structure of the hose remains unobstructed, and that it is positioned upright from the bottom to the top, ensuring free flow of water. Hoses from AEG Service Force should be utilized to maintain proper function.

Every setup includes a reference for measuring the outlet height relative to the pump head. If this height exceeds specified limits, consult AEG Service Force for further guidance.
