To set up the receiver, connect the broadcasts or other compatible devices to the AUDIO R input. If you’re linking to an RF source, connect it to the ANT.IN instead. Please ensure to unpack all items including the software, documentation, and CD-ROM. Thank you for your purchase. For high-quality recording, follow the provided on-screen instructions for proper configuration based on your country’s standards. Typically, connect the TV to other devices like VCRs or DVDs. Note that both Macintosh and other receivers can be directly connected. The optional DC-12V power supply can be used, and AAA batteries are recommended for operation. Once the software from the CD-ROM is installed, you can record and manage your audio and video inputs through the appropriate channels.
