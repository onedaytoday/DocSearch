**Cookware Guidelines**

The type of cookware you use significantly affects cooking results, particularly how heat is distributed while rotating the cookware. It's important to ensure that cookware is correctly matched in size, not exceeding a warping tolerance of half an inch. Using heavy cookware aids in heat transfer, helping to maintain consistent cooking temperatures.

To avoid scratches, handle cookware with care, especially where coatings are involved, and promptly address any damage. Most cookware retains heat efficiently, but remember that it requires time to cool once cooking is finished.

When selecting cookware, consider applicable heating ratings to match your cooking needs. Use the proper size burners corresponding to your cookware type, ensuring even heat distribution. Avoid blocking ventilation openings during operation for optimal performance.

The Wave-Touch controls offer various settings, indicated by LED displays, to manage cooking temperature. For instance, higher heat settings enable quicker cooking but may require monitoring to prevent overheating. If a cooking item is left unattended too long, it may lead to burns or other hazards.

**Warmer Functionality**

The warmer is intended for keeping foods such as soups and breads at a safe temperature but should not be used for cooking. Always cover food items to maintain heat effectively, and avoid leaving them in the warmer if it becomes too hot, as indicated by the HE light turning off.

**Preheating Guidelines**

To preheat your oven, follow these instructions based on the desired temperature, adjusting accordingly for convection cooking when necessary. Ensure to cancel preheating if cooking plans change. For specific cooking items requiring particular temperatures, refer to the preheat feature, selecting either the upper or lower oven as required.

Should any cooking fires occur, handle them with care, using appropriate extinguishing methods. For specific meats and thicker items, follow detailed preheating and cooking guidelines to ensure safety and optimal results.

**Convection Cooking**

Utilizing convection settings allows for improved cooking efficiency by circulating heat. Make sure to adjust cooking times and temperatures as indicated in instructions. Always ensure cookware size is appropriate for the intended function to prevent any mishaps.

In summary, adherence to specific settings and guidelines will enhance the cooking experience while ensuring safety within the kitchen environment.

Here’s a more technical and concise paraphrase of the provided text:

This option enables the use of the Conv Bake feature, optimizing cooking performance. It is essential to utilize recommended settings to ensure food is cooked properly and heated evenly. To initiate this process, select the desired cooking mode (UPPER or LOWER OVEN) and adjust the temperature as needed. Use the CONV BAKE function and press START. The display will indicate PRE-HEATING, and the oven will notify you when it reaches the desired temperature of 350°F (176°C).

When roasting, ensure items are positioned correctly to allow adequate heat circulation. Follow the guidelines for various food types, including poultry and meats, referencing the Conv Roasting Chart for optimal results while preventing over-browning.

To verify food is thoroughly cooked, especially meat, utilize a probe thermometer to check internal temperatures according to recommended values. This practice helps avoid foodborne illnesses. Select options such as KEEP WARM or CONV ROAST, pressing START to initiate and monitoring as necessary. 

For slow cooking, begin by selecting UPPER OVEN and the SLOW COOK setting, adjusting the heat and duration to achieve desired tenderness without burning. 

Finally, for proofing bread, use the BREAD PROOF option to maintain a stable, warm environment, ensuring the dough rises effectively. Always cancel cooking when necessary to halt processes.

Refer to specific temperature guidelines for different food types, and ensure cooked items are monitored for safety and doneness accordingly.
