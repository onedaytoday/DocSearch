### Delay Timer Instructions

The Delay Timer allows you to set hours before a cycle begins. To activate it, press the **DELAY TIMER** button followed by the **START/PAUSE** button. The timer will indicate the set hours. If you need to turn it off, hold the **DELAY TIMER** button. 

To set a pre-wash, press the **PRE-WASH** button followed by the **DELAY TIMER**. The **WASH TIME** lights will indicate the duration, approximately one hour, and can be adjusted by pressing the button repeatedly.

To check or adjust settings while closing the door, use the **DOOR/LIGHT** button. This button illuminates to show whether the door is properly closed. 

For pre-wash treatment, use the right compartment for detergents and additives as specified in the manual. If the **START/PAUSE** button is pressed and the **DOOR/LIGHT** flashes, ensure the door is securely closed.

During the washing cycle, the **WASH TIME** will be displayed, and you can cancel the operation to return to standby mode by pressing the **START/PAUSE** button.

### Expected Loading and Program Options

For cotton and linen fabrics, select the appropriate load type. This is shown on the display (e.g., COTTONS/LINEN, EASY-CARE). If you select the **EASY IRON** option, the corresponding cycle phase will be indicated by a flashing light.

To adjust the cycle—be it SPIN SPEED, DRAIN, or any specific option—use the **START/PAUSE** button.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

To maintain optimal performance, regularly clean the internal components and filter, following the guidelines in the manual. Ensure that the washing machine is turned off and unplugged before cleaning. Always clean with a soft cloth to avoid damage.

### Troubleshooting

If issues arise, check if the machine is receiving power and ensure the door is closed properly. If an error code appears (C1, C2, etc.), consult the troubleshooting section of the manual.

If problems persist, contact service support. Be prepared to describe the issue and any error codes displayed.

### Important Safety Information

Be cautious of the high temperatures during cycles; allow the machine to cool down before performing maintenance. Ensure that all components, including hoses and filters, are correctly installed and free from blockages.

**Instructions for Using the Drain Hose**

To securely operate the drain hose, turn it clockwise. In case of an emergency, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply first. If manual operation is required, begin with the emptying section. Use a coin to rotate the dial clockwise to access the appropriate settings. 

**Using the Rinse Function (RINSE+)**

This feature can be beneficial for specific fabrics, including Cottons/Linen, Easy-Cares, Easy Iron, and Delicates. Rotate the dial to select "Short Spin" and hold the SENSITIVE button for at least a few seconds. You’ll notice the RINSE indicator flashing for a few moments. When RINSE is flashing, release the SENSITIVE button. If you wish to activate the Short Spin again, rotate the dial accordingly and press the SENSITIVE button until RINSE flashes continuously.

**Water Cooling Instructions**

To activate water cooling, follow these steps: set the dial to "Short Spin" and hold the PRE-WASH button for a few seconds. The MAIN WASH indicator will then flash. Release the PRE-WASH button while MAIN WASH is flashing, if cooling is desired. Repeat the process as necessary until the cooling feature engages fully.

**Integrated Functionality for Stain Removal**

To utilize the stain protection feature, rotate the dial to "Short Spin" and press the STAIN button for several seconds until the END light begins flashing. Once it flashes continuously, release the STAIN button. 

**Child Lock Feature**

The child lock can be activated while the machine is running, ensuring safety during operation. To enable or disable the child lock, press and hold the START/PAUSE and PRE-WASH buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. The system will indicate whether the child lock is active.

**Transporting the Appliance**

When transporting the appliance, do so with the front or right side facing forward to avoid damage. Use a trolley for support; otherwise, the machine could be at risk of falling or sustaining damage. 

**Installation Site Requirements**

Ensure the installation area is clean and free from sources of heat, steam, or moisture. Use screws for secure installation and make sure to capture the specified clearance for safe operation.

**Electrical Safety Warning**

This appliance must be earthed. Ensure the power supply conforms to the electrical ratings specified in the user manual. The rating plate is typically located on the top of the appliance. Properly connect the earth wire to avoid electrical hazards.

**Water Supply and Drainage**

The appliance should ideally be connected to a permanent plumbing system. Ensure that the water inlet hose is installed correctly without kinks, and the drainage hose is positioned upright and secured to prevent leaks.
