**Important Safeguards**  
To mitigate risks of fire, electric shock, or injury, adhere to the following precautions:  
- Always turn off the vacuum and unplug it before servicing or cleaning.  
- Keep the vacuum out of reach of children and use only as directed with recommended attachments.  
- Avoid using the vacuum on wet surfaces or near heat sources.  
- Ensure the cord is kept clear of furniture edges and does not become damaged.  
- Check for blockages and clean filters regularly to maintain optimal airflow and suction.  

**WARNING:** The cleaning head rotates at high speeds; ensure the vacuum is off when not in use. If it shuts off due to overheating, allow it to cool before switching it back on.  

**Connecting to Your Electricity Supply**  
Before connecting to the electricity supply, verify the voltage matches the rating plate's specifications, which is located beneath the cord cover. If permanently installing the vacuum, utilize a 13A plug and follow appropriate connection procedures. Ensure all wires are connected correctly to prevent hazards. 

**Service Information**  
For cleaner service inquiries, please contact Customer Services. Be sure to address any issues promptly for efficient cleaning performance. 

**Routine Maintenance**  
To maintain optimal performance, routinely check and clean components, including the filter and hoses, to prevent clogs. Follow the detailed instructions for cleaning and maintenance included in this guide.

**Periodic Maintenance**  
Perform regular checks on the brush roll and other parts. Address any wear or damage promptly to ensure the unit operates efficiently. 

**NOTE:** Retain all instructions for future reference, and keep your proof of purchase for warranty purposes.

### Periodic Maintenance

To perform periodic maintenance, remove the screws located at the top (see FIG.) and around the pulley and base (refer to FIG.). Ensure that the base is securely stretched to the right. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to rotate the cleaner properly and check the screws for tightness (see FIG. for reference).

### Problem Solving for Hose Issues

**CAUTION:** Always turn off the power switch before servicing. Detach the hose from the cleaner (refer to FIG.). Inspect the hose for any obstructions. If any blockages are found, clear them to restore functionality. If the hose is obstructed or damaged, ensure it is cleared and reattach it to the cleaner (see FIG.). 

Check the attachment screw securing the clear hose to the back of the cleaner, and ensure it is tightened (see FIG.). 

### Additional Problem Solving Procedures

**CAUTION:** Ensure the power switch is turned off while performing maintenance. If suction is inadequate, check for blockages in the hose that may be restricting airflow. Clean any debris out of the hose and reattach it in the correct orientation. If the cleaner is rated for a certain height, adjust it as necessary. Make sure the hose is properly seated and secure both at the top and back of the cleaner to ensure optimal performance. Verify that the hose is free of damage, such as clogs or excessive wear, which can impede airflow.
