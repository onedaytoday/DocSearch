### Food Storage Suggestions

**Fresh Food Storage**  
Fresh food should be stored at the appropriate temperature and not overcrowded on shelves to ensure proper airflow and effective cooling. Meat should be securely wrapped and separated from other food items to prevent contamination. Refrigerators operate efficiently when loaded properly. Wrap food tightly in airtight containers to avoid freezer burn and maintain freshness. Avoid overloading shelves, especially with hard-to-freeze items, as this can hinder proper airflow and cooling.

**Energy-Saving Tips**  
Maximize energy efficiency by minimizing direct sunlight exposure and keeping heat-producing appliances away from the refrigerator. Proper insulation in cabinetry can enhance efficiency. Ensure that the refrigerator door seals are intact and clean to maintain optimal performance.

### Understanding Operational Sounds

The sounds produced by high-efficiency appliances can be normal but may raise concerns. Below are common sounds you might hear and their meanings:

- **A**: Flow of refrigerant through the system.
- **B**: Air being forced through vents.
- **C**: Defrost heater making hissing noises during operation.
- **D**: Clicking sounds when the defrost cycle activates.
- **E**: Cracking or popping noise from temperature changes.
- **F**: High-pitched sounds from the compressor.
