### Slow Cooking Instructions

**Slow Cooking Overview**  
Using a slow cooker is an efficient way to prepare meals, particularly tougher cuts of meat and hearty dishes like stews and casseroles. It usually results in evenly cooked food without extensive browning, and it's a cost-effective method.

#### Cooking Techniques

1. **Cooking Meat and Poultry**  
   - For whole cuts of meat, it’s advisable to cook any stuffing separately. Cook the meat for at least several hours, ensuring it reaches a minimum internal temperature of 88°C (190°F) using a meat thermometer.
   - Always thaw meat thoroughly before cooking, and prepare soups, casseroles, and stews by bringing ingredients to a high temperature on the stovetop before transferring them to the slow cooker.

2. **Covering Food**  
   - Foods should be covered tightly during cooking to retain moisture.

3. **Thickening Agents**  
   - To thicken sauces or dishes, cornflour can be added. Take care to prevent curdling by controlling the cooking temperature.

#### Care and Maintenance

- **Cleaning**  
   - Allow the appliance to cool completely before cleaning, and avoid using harsh cleaning materials. Do not use bleach or scouring pads that might damage appliance finishes.
   - For exterior surfaces, use a soft cloth. Be cautious with cleaning knobs and handles to avoid dulling their finish.

- **Wirework and Components**  
   - Remove and replace wire runners and shelves as necessary. Ensure components are securely reattached.

- **Hob Cleaning**  
   - Clean the hotplate and burner crowns regularly. Use suitable cleaners that don’t damage the surfaces.

#### Oven and Grill Maintenance

- **Cleaning Inside the Oven**  
   - Interior surfaces typically have a Stayclean coating that requires manual cleaning. Follow specific instructions for cleaning to avoid damaging the finish.

- **Door Cleaning**  
   - Use appropriate household cleaners, avoiding bleaches and caustics. For thorough cleaning between the glass panels, you may need to remove the outer glass carefully.

## MOVING YOUR APPLIANCE

When relocating your appliance, ensure it is securely covered to prevent damage. For safe transportation, carefully detach the appliance from its front and back, ensuring each corner is adequately supported. 

### LOCATION OF APPLIANCE

The appliance should not be placed in damp areas such as bathrooms or near showers. Maintain a distance between shelves and the top of the hotplate (or cooker) as specified in the user instructions. If the appliance’s height needs adjustment, refer to the guidelines provided for compliance with safety regulations. LPG units must not be installed below ground level or in boats.

### LEVELING THE APPLIANCE

Achieve the correct height by adjusting the leveling feet, rotating them clockwise or counterclockwise as needed. Ensure shelves are properly aligned.

### CONNECTING TO THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY

**Warning:** Ensure the appliance is earthed. Connect only to an AC power supply. The electricity supply must be properly earthed and accessible for emergency disconnection. The cable should be routed safely, maintaining adequate height from the floor. If the supply is not compatible or needs replacement, contact Service Force. 

The appliance must be connected following the guidelines outlined below, ensuring all connections are safe and within specifications. The color coding for wiring is as follows: 
- Green and Yellow – Earth
- Blue – Neutral
- Brown – Live

Each wire should be connected to its corresponding terminal:
- Green and Yellow to the earth terminal
- Blue to the neutral terminal
- Brown to the live terminal

If a molded plug is used, ensure compliance with applicable safety standards.

### CONNECTING TO GAS SUPPLY

Connections should only be made using the specified BSP threaded inlet located beneath the hotplate. **Note:** Only liquid sealants should be used when fitting the inlet gas pipe; do not use PTFE tape. Ensure the hose is properly secured, and that it complies with BS 669 for flexible tubing.

### FITTING THE STABILITY CHAIN

It is recommended to secure the appliance using a stability chain for safety. Follow the provided instructions to anchor the chain correctly to the designated points.

### PRESSURE TESTING

### CHECKING THE GRILL

Ensure the grill is functioning correctly by activating it and observing when gas is released.

### CHECKING THE HOTPLATE

Verify that the crowns of the hotplates are seated properly. Turn on the hotplate to confirm operation, adjusting as necessary.

### CHECKING LID SHUT-OFF DEVICE

Activate the shut-off device by ensuring the hotplate is turned off. The gas supply should disconnect automatically when the hotplate is off.

### CHECKING THE MAIN OVEN
