**Chillers Overview**

Chillers are designed to rapidly cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively reducing the risk of bacterial growth. The chilling process maintains the food temperature at +3°C. These systems provide comprehensive performance through crosswise configurations with integrated features.

**Operating Modes**

The chillers feature multiple operating modes, including:

- **Soft Chilling** (to 2°C)
- **Chilling** (to 12°C)

The ARTE model continuously monitors the cooling process from the time food is inserted. The device includes built-in functionalities for defrosting and maintaining HACCP compliance, displaying countdowns and service information (P1, P2) for each operating mode. This data is crucial for tracking and documenting operational performance, especially in cases of abnormal terminations.

**Performance**

Chillers are optimized for various types of cooling applications, complying with NF standards.

**Construction and Finishing**

The chillers feature a high-quality AISI stainless steel construction and high-density polyurethane insulation, which is HCFC-free. They are designed with rounded edges and are compliant with ISO standards. The units have a protection rating of IP20.
