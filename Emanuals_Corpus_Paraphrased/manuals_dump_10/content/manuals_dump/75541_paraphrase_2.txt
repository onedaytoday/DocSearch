The Bridge features both a front section and specific cooking functionalities related to cookware. When using cookware, the Bridge operates separately, allowing for adjustments as necessary. It utilizes heat from both inner and outer sources, and users can switch between these heat settings effectively by turning the cookware clockwise or counterclockwise.

To optimize cooking, adjust the settings on the Bridge according to the heat requirements for each type of cookware. After cooking, ensure to turn the setting to OFF when cooking is complete, allowing the cookware to cool adequately before handling. It’s advisable to not touch hot cookware until it has sufficiently cooled down to avoid burns.

For warming purposes, the Bridge is designed to maintain the temperature of pre-cooked foods, such as stews and breads. Use a cover while warming to retain heat effectively. This feature is equipped with various heat settings, including high (HI), medium (MED), and low (LO), which should be adjusted accordingly based on the food item. A recommended food table is provided for guidance on heating different types of food, indicating the appropriate settings.

Selecting the right cookware can significantly influence cooking efficiency. It's important to follow the manufacturer's guidance on compatible cookware materials, such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and cast iron, to ensure optimal heat transfer. Avoid using glass due to its susceptibility to scratches.

To maintain the appliance, refer to the manual for cleaning instructions and operate the oven as outlined, utilizing features like SPEED CLEAN and self-cleaning as necessary. The clock should be set to ensure the oven functions properly during operations. 

For timer functions, the process can be initiated by the TIMER ON/OFF settings. Continuous operation can be configured by pressing specific buttons to manage cooking times efficiently, allowing for a smoother cooking experience. 

When adjusting the temperature, the oven can be set between 170°F and 550°F, with clear instructions provided to navigate settings for baking and other functions. Always consult the manual for precise operations and safety instructions when using this appliance.

Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

The BAKE and BAKE TIME settings allow you to manage cooking durations and temperatures. To immediately start or automatically shut off at 350°F, use the oven racks and place the food inside. Press "BAKE" and observe as it appears on the display; then select "TIMED," which will flash. Set the cooking duration in hours and press both the TIMED and BAKE buttons. Once initiated, the oven will sound an alert upon completion and shut off after the set time. It is imperative to promptly remove food to prevent foodborne illness.

To operate the oven at 350°F, select the appropriate settings using the interface. The maximum preheating temperature is 550°F, while the operational range is 400°F to 550°F. If a fire ignites during cooking, maintain coverage and use an extinguisher. Avoid covering the food with grease while cooking to prevent flare-ups.

Convection cooking enhances heat distribution, allowing food to cook more evenly. To activate CONV BAKE, select the temperature, and initiate by pressing the "CONV BAKE" button. This mode is highly effective for bread and other baked goods by reducing cooking time and improving results.

For CONV ROAST, choose the desired temperature and ensure meats are placed properly in the oven to allow heat circulation while avoiding contact with grease. This setting improves browning and cooking efficiency.

The CONV CONVERT function minimizes cooking times for specific foods. To utilize this feature accurately, ensure food is fully submerged in the designated temperature range. 

To save preferred settings using the FAVORITE SETTING feature, the adjusted parameters can be programmed for future use. Follow the prompts to record settings or retrieve them as needed.

On the Sabbath setting, the oven can run continuously without interruption but will only utilize specific functions. When engaged, the oven is set to 350°F or other desired temperatures. It is important to adhere to operational guidelines to ensure compliance with religious practices.

Ensure safety precautions are followed during self-cleaning and warming operations, as improper procedures may lead to injury or damage. Always check the components to confirm they are seated correctly, preventing mechanical failures.

The Self-Cleaning feature is designed to maintain the health and cleanliness of the appliance but should not be forced off prematurely. Ensure that it does not come into contact with walls, racks, or other surfaces that could be damaged. The interior reaches extremely high temperatures to effectively eliminate food residue, reducing it to ash that can be wiped away. Avoid using any cleaning agents or protective coatings on or around the Self-Cleaning area, as this could compromise its functionality.

The high temperatures can cause these surfaces to become very hot, potentially resulting in burns. Once the Self-Cleaning cycle is complete, the door will automatically lock during the process and will only unlock when it has cooled down sufficiently.

To initiate the Self-Cleaning cycle, press the "CLEAN" button and select the desired duration, which can range from a few hours depending on the cleaning mode chosen. Supervise children around the appliance during this process, as it generates extreme heat.

If the optional Self-Clean feature is activated, the "DOOR LOCKED" light will illuminate, confirming that it is operating. Pressing the DELAY option will allow setting the cycle to start at a later time. Always consult the Cleaning section of the manual for detailed instructions.

After the cycle has ended and the appliance has cooled for about an hour, the door will unlock, and you can safely access the interior. Take care to follow all safety notes while operating the Self-Cleaning feature, as it requires close attention to avoid burns or other injuries.

Regarding cleaning methods, use appropriate cloths and cleaners that won’t scratch or damage surfaces. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaning tools, as they can damage the appliance. Always allow the oven to cool before cleaning, and ensure that cleaning agents are compatible to prevent chemical reactions.

When adjusting the temperature or cleaning settings, follow the instructions carefully to avoid unwanted issues. If problems arise during the cycle, such as irregular behavior or error codes displayed, consult the service manual for troubleshooting guidance.
