To connect, users need to input the appropriate IP address, which can be verified through services like www.123ip.com. Upon following the necessary steps, the ELMO DVR screen will display relevant data, prompting the creation of new user groups, which are customizable based on character input.

Users can also establish or stop connections to ELMO DVR while ensuring that ultimately, the software is responsive to the current network state. Should a user's needs change—like wanting to discontinue a session—they can easily execute the disconnection process via the interface.

The software allows extensive recording options depending on user needs. When recording, users can choose from various formats, including Snapshot, Encrypted, or AVI. They can initiate a recording session, select multiple options as needed, and all recorded data is automatically saved to the selected format.

While the ELMO DVR Remote is in use, users can search through recorded data, both on local devices and remotely from the DVR. The system is capable of identifying previous sessions quickly and can facilitate choosing specific footage for playback. Playback controls are simple, allowing users to navigate through recorded files effectively.
