### Using the Simmer Plate

To utilize the simmer plate, position it on the cooking surface, ensuring it aligns properly with the designated notches. Use potholders to avoid burns, as the plate can reach high temperatures. Allow it to cool down before placing it on heat-sensitive surfaces like countertops.

### Setting Surface Controls

When adjusting surface controls, select the appropriate settings based on the type and amount of food being prepared. Monitor the indicator lights which will illuminate when the burner is activated. Exercise caution with items like potholders that could ignite if left too close to the heat source. 

To manually ignite the burner, use a match to touch the igniter while turning the knob to the "Lite" position. 

### Starting the Oven

Locate and remove screws from the self-cleaning oven's brackets to prepare for use. Always install oven rack supports before activating the oven and ensure it’s cool during this process. 

### Recommended Rack Positions for Baking

Arrange oven racks while the oven is cool to prevent burns. Positioning will vary based on the type of food being cooked: foods requiring rising should go in the center for optimal heat circulation, while those benefiting from browning can be placed higher up.

### Control Features

Familiarize yourself with oven functions by carefully reading the instructions prior to use. Key controls include:

- **Selector Control Knob**: For functions such as Convection Roast, Convection Bake, and Self-Clean.
- **Oven Temperature Control Knob**: For precise temperature adjustments.

### Baking Tips

Ensure the oven is preheated to 350°F before placing food inside to avoid uneven cooking or burning. If experiencing issues like cookies spreading too much or burning, verify the oven is not overcrowded, and adjust temperatures as necessary.

### Convection Cooking

Convection cooking circulates heat effectively, enhancing cooking efficiency and speed. For best results, ensure the oven is adequately preheated and food is arranged to allow airflow.

### Broiling Guidelines

Preheat the broiler for optimum browning. Avoid covering food during this process to prevent grease buildup and ignition risks. Be attentive to any smoke or flare-ups and follow safety protocols in case of fire.

### Self-Cleaning Instructions

Before using the self-clean feature, ensure the oven is cool. Wear protective gear as needed. Do not use harsh chemicals that could interfere with the self-cleaning process. High temperatures can be used for thorough cleaning but avoid leaving any food residues that could cause burning. 

Clean the oven interior and racks cautiously, following all safety guidelines to minimize risks. Always check that the self-clean indicator light is on to confirm the process is active.

### Oven Self-Cleaning Cycle Instructions

**Initiating the Self-Clean Cycle:**  
Before starting the self-clean cycle, ensure the oven has cooled down adequately, which typically takes about an hour. The cleaning process does generally require a few hours to complete. 

**Warnings:**  
- Keep children away during the self-cleaning cycle due to the high temperatures.
- Do not attempt to force open the oven door when engaged in self-cleaning; it will lock automatically during this process and may pose safety risks.

**General Cleaning:**  
For routine cleaning, ensure the oven is turned off and cooled down. Remove any spills or heavy soiling immediately to minimize the need for major cleanings later on. Regular maintenance can significantly reduce the frequency of deep cleanings. 

**Materials for Cleaning:**  
Use a soft cloth and non-abrasive cleaners to wipe down painted surfaces, plastic components, and decorative chrome features. Avoid scratching these surfaces with harsh scouring pads or cleaners.

**Burner Grates and Heads Maintenance:**  
To clean the burner grates, caps, and heads, ensure they are cool before attempting to clean. These components can often be washed in a dishwasher for convenience. Make sure no spills or food debris enter the gas orifice holder to maintain proper gas flow.

**Cooktop Cleaning and Maintenance:**  
Before cleaning the ceramic glass cooktop, ensure it is turned off and cooled down. Never use bleach or rough scrubbers as they can scratch the surface. Immediate cleaning is recommended to prevent the buildup of burnt-on food.

**Removing and Replacing the Oven Door:**  
To detach the oven door, locate the release tabs on the front and apply pressure while rotating the top. Follow specific care instructions to avoid scratches and damage.

**Replacing the Oven Light:**  
The oven light can be accessed and replaced if needed. Make sure the oven is cool before attempting any maintenance, and always use the protective shield when the oven is in use.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Surface Burners Not Igniting:**  
Ensure the burners are completely turned to the "LITE" position. If they remain clogged, follow the cleaning guidelines for the grates and heads.

2. **Flame Issues:**  
If the flame only lights halfway, the burner might be clogged. Perform thorough cleaning as per the guidelines provided.

3. **Discoloration and Marks on Cooktop:**  
Brown streaks or metal marks can usually be removed with recommended cleaners. For scratches, avoid abrasive materials.

4. **Electrical Issues:**  
If the oven isn't operating correctly, check all connections to ensure they are secure. This includes checking for blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers.

5. **Excessive Smoke During Broiling:**  
If the oven produces excessive smoke, verify that the meat is not too close to the heating element. Adjust positioning and ensure regular cleaning to prevent grease buildup.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure the proper maintenance and functionality of your oven.

Here is a paraphrased version of your text:

### Common Issues with the Self-Cleaning Feature:

1. **Self-Cleaning Cycle Dysfunction**: If the self-cleaning cycle doesn't function correctly, ensure the oven door is closed properly and follow the user instructions. If the cleaning is interrupted, the lights may turn off after a designated time.

2. **Incomplete Soil Removal**: If soil is not fully removed after the self-cleaning cycle, you may need to clean the oven manually.

3. **Smoke or Flames**: High grease levels could lead to smoke from the vent or flames inside the oven.
