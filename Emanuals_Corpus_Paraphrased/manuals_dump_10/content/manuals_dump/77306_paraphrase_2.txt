### Troubleshooting Specifications

**Instructions for Setup:**
To properly set up the unit, start by carefully reading the instructions. Ensure that the base is securely attached to the back of the monitor; it should click into place when correctly fitted. Make sure the monitor is upright and positioned at least a few inches away from the wall at the back for proper grounding. Tighten all screws to prevent any interference with your TV and ensure the AC connections are secure.

**On-Screen Display (OSD) Controls:**
To access the settings, press the MENU button on the front of the monitor. The OSD will display options for Brightness, Contrast, and other settings. When functioning normally, the menu will flash, indicating you can select different options. Use the arrow buttons to highlight the desired setting. Press MENU to select, and EXIT to return. Adjust brightness and contrast levels, along with various positioning options.

**Image Adjustment:**
Settings like TILT, PINCUSHION, PIN BALANCE, PARALLELOGRAM, and TRAPEZOID can be adjusted as needed. Adjustments can help correct image distortions. The DEGAUSS option can help eliminate moir√© patterns. You can also select factory color options or custom user settings.

**Maintenance Warnings:**
Always power off the unit before cleaning to avoid electric shock. Use a soft cloth lightly dampened with a cleaner appropriate for screens. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight or extreme heat which could cause burn-in damage.

**Troubleshooting Guidelines:**
If the monitor is not functioning properly, ensure that all connections are secure. Check if the power is on and if the input source is correctly set. If images appear scrambled or distorted, reset the monitor to factory settings via the OSD. Environmental factors such as non-shielded cables or proximity to electronic devices and light sources could also cause issues.
