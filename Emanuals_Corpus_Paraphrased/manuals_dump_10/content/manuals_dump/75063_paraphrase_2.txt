**AG-72D-UK ENGLISH**

Using the microwave is straightforward for tasks such as defrosting, reheating, and cooking. It is advisable to follow the cooking guidelines, opting for shorter cooking times rather than prolonged ones to ensure food is heated thoroughly and safely. Start with defrosting, reheating, and cooking at recommended temperatures (approximately 70°C). To avoid issues like food explosion, ensure to follow microwave instructions precisely and cover certain foods during cooking to prevent splattering.

Microwaves heat food unevenly, necessitating the rotation of items like roasts for even cooking. Unlike conventional ovens, food in a microwave can be overcooked if the settings are not correctly adjusted. For effective heating, consider using a food thermometer to check whether food is adequately cooked—clear juices in meats indicate doneness. 

For ready-prepared meals, ensure they are covered to maintain moisture and prevent drying out. Defrosting should generally be performed at lower power settings to avoid partially cooking the food. Thicker items should be heated carefully to prevent the outer layers from overcooking while the center remains cold. 

When preparing fresh meals, season as usual, and ascertain that the cooking time allows for even penetration of heat. The guidelines generally suggest that doubling the amount of food will approximately double the cooking time, while halving the amount will cut the time in half.

When using the microwave, select the appropriate cooking mode either for heating, defrosting, or grilling. Adjust the cooking time using the TIMER/WEIGHT/POWER settings, ensuring that the microwave door remains closed during operation for optimal heating.

The microwave also supports various cooking sequences, allowing for a combination of microwave and grilling functions to achieve the desired results. It is essential to monitor the cooking process to prevent burning or uneven cooking.
