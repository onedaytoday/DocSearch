For installations involving heating elements, confirm that all ducting is sealed and appropriate for that type of application. This includes connecting to any heaters or heating systems as detailed in the ELECTRICAL CONNECTION section.

The chimney installation consists of an upper and lower section. Adjust the upper chimney section slightly to facilitate proper alignment with the outlet, securing it with the four screws as shown. Similarly, for the lower chimney section, make minor adjustments for correct positioning and fasten it using the designated screws. 

The specified location for the installation is High Street, Berkshire SL1 1DZ.
