When introducing new food items, adhere to the recommended storage capacities to ensure freshness. Items that are improperly sealed can burst due to pressure, so monitor storage practices closely. Should you notice a malfunction or inconsistency in temperature, please consult the customer service department for assistance.

Regular cleaning, including the preparation of ice cubes and the appliance’s interior, is necessary to avoid potential electrical hazards. Always ensure the appliance is unplugged during cleaning to reduce the risk of electric shock.
