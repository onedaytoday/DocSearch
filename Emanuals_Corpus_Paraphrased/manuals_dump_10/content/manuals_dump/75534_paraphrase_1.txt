### Thermal Grilling

**Uses of Thermal Grilling**  
Thermal grilling combines heat sources that surround the food, resulting in more efficient cooking. This method helps to reduce cooking times by allowing for enclosed heat circulation. Foods that typically require significant cooking, like shepherd's pie, can benefit from this method, as it ensures even heating and browning.

**Selecting Thermal Grilling**  
To activate thermal grilling, set the function to "Thermal" and choose a temperature between 140°C and 220°C. **Note:** Ensure the oven door remains closed during the cooking process.

**Important Considerations**  
Once the desired temperature is reached, the system will indicate it is operational. The internal light signals cooking status, and cooling measures are initiated after the function is turned off.

**Tips for Effective Thermal Grilling**  
For optimal results, lightly coat food with oil and position it strategically within the oven. Adjust the shelf heights as needed based on the type of food being cooked. It’s important to flip or rotate food as required for even cooking. Cooking times will vary based on the thickness of the items and other factors.
