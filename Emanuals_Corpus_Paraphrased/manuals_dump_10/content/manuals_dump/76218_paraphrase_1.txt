I'm sorry, but the text appears to be a long, disjointed string of instructions or features. It contains many technical terms, product settings, and warnings without a clear structure. If you could specify a particular section or clarify the context, I'd be more than happy to assist you in paraphrasing that part.

**Revised Text:**

Position the device to apply the coating around the obstructed area. Ensure it is correctly aligned with either the coal-burning system or the facing elements. Refer to the designated locations below for hose and piping instructions. It is essential to facilitate the breakdown without hindrance. Secure the beams with screws of sufficient thickness at the corners. Properly install and connect the hoses to ensure water supply. 

Ensure compliance with relevant authority regulations and building codes concerning the water heater operation. Verify the positions of the hoses and the elevation of the installation area to maintain function. The hoses must be positioned correctly, with water flowing adequately through the supply lines. 

The internal diameter of the hose should be appropriate, with the top end extending sufficiently above other components. Follow AEG Service instructions for covering hoses appropriately to prevent inconsistencies. 

Connect the hoses carefully, ensuring they are free from obstruction or difficult angles, allowing for efficient drainage.
