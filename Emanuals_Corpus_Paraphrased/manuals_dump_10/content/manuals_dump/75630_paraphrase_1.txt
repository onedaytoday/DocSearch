**Common Concerns Regarding Ice and Light Functions**

If the ice compartment is empty or if the household food storage is closed, avoid overloading it with items. Ensure that food is not touching the top of the compartment, as this could cause improper cooling. Regularly clean the interior to prevent clogs that may interfere with the performance of lights or LED indicators. If the lights are flashing, this may indicate that the unit is too cold. 

To maintain satisfactory conditions, check the connection to the household water supply; if it’s disconnected or clogged, that could lead to issues with cooling. Ensure that the sealing mechanism is intact and properly fitted, particularly in changing weather conditions.

**Water and Moisture Concerns**

Excess water may collect on the walls or cover of the appliance due to improper drainage or supply issues. Ensure that the household water supply is adequately connected, and that the cut-off phase is set correctly. Regular inspections and maintenance are necessary to prevent ice buildup or internal sweating.

**Warranty Information**

Your purchase includes a warranty covering defects in materials or workmanship when used according to provided instructions. This warranty covers the replacement or repair of parts for a period ranging from one year from the date of purchase, or the shortest duration allowed by law in your jurisdiction. Electrolux is not liable for incidental damages, like property damage resulting from any warranty breach.
