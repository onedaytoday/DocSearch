### Instructions for Speed/Selecting RINSE HOLD (ARRET CUVE PLEINE, SPOELSTOP)

To activate the RINSE HOLD (ARRET CUVE PLEINE/SPOELSTOP) feature, press the corresponding button. If this option is selected, the washing process will pause. To proceed to the desired washing program, select from the following options: 
- COTTONS/LINEN (BLANC/COULEURS, WITTE/BONTE WAS)
- ENERGY SAVING (ECONOMIQUE, E-STAND)
- EASY-CARES/EASY IRON (TEXTILES MELANGES/FACILE REPASSER, KREUKHERSTELLEND/STRIJKVRIJ)

- WOOL/SILK (LAINE/SOIE, WOL/ZIJDE) (Handwash)

The DELAY TIMER (DEPART DIFFERE/STARTTIJDKEUZE) enables you to set a delayed start by pressing it once to add up to three hours. The timer activates only when the START/PAUSE (MARCHE/PAUSE, START/PAUZE) button is pressed. If the END (FIN/EINDE) light flashes when START/PAUSE is pressed, ensure the door is closed securely. Repeat this until the lights indicate the desired status.

To turn off the machine, rotate the knob to OFF (ARRET/UIT). You can also choose to DRAIN (VIDANGE/POMPEN) or SPIN (ESSORAGE/CENTRIFUG.) by pressing START/PAUSE (MARCHE/PAUSE, START/PAUZE). If any option is temporarily halted, return the knob to OFF (ARRET/UIT).

### Selecting Operation Options

For time-saving, press the TIME SAVING (COURT/KORT) option and then press START/PAUSE (MARCHE/PAUSE, START/PAUZE). Be mindful that if RINSE HOLD (ARRET CUVE PLEINE/SPOELSTOP) is active, you may need to press START/PAUSE accordingly.

Upon cycle completion, look for the END (FIN/EINDE) light. If RINSE HOLD (ARRET CUVE PLEINE/SPOELSTOP) is activated, the DOOR (PORTE/DEUR) and END lights will first turn off, then switch to DRAIN and START/PAUSE (MARCHE/PAUSE, START/PAUZE) or SPIN. Once finalized, the lights will indicate completion.
