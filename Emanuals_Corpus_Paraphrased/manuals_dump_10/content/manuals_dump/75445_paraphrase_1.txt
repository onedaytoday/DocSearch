**Installation and Service Guidelines:**

**Important:** Installation and maintenance must be carried out by a qualified technician. Retain this document for local electrical inspector reference. Keep these instructions for future use and adhere to all applicable codes and regulations. Any deviations may result in fire hazards or endanger lives or property.

**Safety Precautions:**
- If you detect a gas odor, act immediately: do not use any electrical switch. Evacuate the area and notify a neighbor to call the gas service provider. Follow established emergency protocols.
  
**Gas Range Installation Requirements:**
1. **Location Specifications:**
   - Refer to the recommended wall height, width, and depth from the range, ensuring adequate clearance from combustible materials. Avoid placing this appliance where it could come into contact with flammable objects.
   - Ensure the installation allows for proper ventilation and unobstructed airflow.
  
2. **Safety Compliance:**
   - Follow the ANSI Z223.1 and NFPA guidelines in conjunction with CSA standards for electrical safety. Ensure that the range is properly grounded to prevent electrical shocks.
   - Use suitable materials that can withstand heat and do not block combustion airflow.
  
3. **Cooking Area Safety:**
   - Keep the cooking area free from clutter, especially items that may be hazardous to children.
   - Take care to avoid prolonged operation without supervision, as this may lead to fire or other risks.

4. **Lighting and Maintenance:**
   - Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for manual ignition and self-cleaning processes. In case of ignition issues, adhere to safety recommendations for lighting the burner.
  
5. **General Maintenance:**
   - Be aware of the location of gas shutoff valves and ensure they are easily accessible for emergency situations. Regularly check for leaks or operational issues.

**Gas Supply Connection:**
- Ensure the gas supply line is correctly connected, grounded, and positioned for convenient access. Don’t allow any components to become pinched or damaged during installation.

**Optional Accessories:**
- Any additional components or features can be purchased through the authorized service provider.

**Conversion Instructions:**
- If converting to LP/propane gas, refer to the specific conversion instructions, including adjustments to orifices.

In summary, adhere closely to these guidelines for safe and effective installation and use of the gas range to mitigate risks and ensure performance.
