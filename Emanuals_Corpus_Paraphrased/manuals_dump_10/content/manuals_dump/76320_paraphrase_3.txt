Here is a technical paraphrase of your provided text:

To effectively tackle stubborn stains overnight, treat them with a cloth soaked in a suitable solution, such as bleach (designated for whites and colors only). For specific stains like lipstick, a targeted approach with bleach on affected white areas is recommended for thorough cleaning. The type and temperature of washing (preferably at 60°C) should be carefully selected along with appropriate additives. 

Prior to washing, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for materials such as delicates and wool. Utilize pre-wash options for heavily soiled items and ensure compatibility with synthetic fabrics. When cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the power supply and follow proper maintenance practices to prevent clogs.

Routine cleaning of filters and catchment areas is necessary to maintain efficiency. If a malfunction occurs, such as an error indicated by flashing lights or sounds, refer to the troubleshooting guidelines. Regularly check hoses for proper function and secure connections, ensuring they are not kinked or obstructed.

Water supply specifications should comply with relevant standards to ensure proper operation of the appliance. If necessary, hoses should be replaced with compliant alternatives to avoid degradation over time. Always adhere to the installation guidelines to prevent inappropriate connections, which may lead to malfunctions. For any persistent issues, consult service instructions or the manufacturer's support.
