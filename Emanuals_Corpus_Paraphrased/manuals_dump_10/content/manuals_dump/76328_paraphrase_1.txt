**EWT and Their Functions**

**Prewash Operation: Information and Setup**

Ensure that the prewash lights are properly illuminated. If you encounter issues with parts such as brooches or screws, it's critical to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations closely. Items must be grouped adequately, and the hose connection should be inspected for damage—remove any finished or torn components. Unpack all items immediately and ensure proper connections are made to the water supply. In the case of installation, confirm that all connections adhere to the specified regulations.

**Frost Precautions**

If temperatures drop below 0°C, take immediate action to prevent damage to hoses. This includes disconnecting the hoses from the water supply and turning off relevant controls. Always refer to specific instructions for individual components and ensure that they are operated correctly. Children should be supervised to avoid misuse.

**Loading and Locking Mechanisms**

When loading the unit, ensure that it is securely closed and locked to prevent accidental opening during operation. Adjust the prewash settings according to the amount of clothing and the selected prewash option. Should the control lights flash while an option is being selected, follow the appropriate guidelines to proceed.

**Washing Program Options**

For the EWT7020W or EWT6020W models, various settings can be selected, including Night options. If an option is temporarily activated, it may either be turned off or remain until the washing cycle is complete. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

To maintain optimal performance, ensure that recommended cleaning agents are used sparingly. Any malfunction should be addressed by consulting the relevant sections of the manual or contacting customer service for assistance related to specific issues.

**Safety and Proper Use**

Ensure all connections are secure and operationally sound. Equipment should not be overloaded, and the distribution of items inside the washer must be balanced. Be mindful of water supply levels, and check for any obstruction that may cause issues like overflowing. 

**Technical Specifications**

Dimensions, electrical specifications (line voltage, frequency, power consumption), and recommended water pressure levels are essential for effective operation. All equipment must be successfully earthed and comply with safety regulations. 

For any concerns or for recycling instructions, visit the manufacturer’s website or consult with local services.
