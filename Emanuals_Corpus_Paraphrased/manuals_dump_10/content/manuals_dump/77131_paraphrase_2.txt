**Phase of Refreshing the Graphics on VGA-Connected LCD Touch Monitors**

The phase of refreshing graphics involves interfacing the LCD and clock signals with the VGA connection. Ensure that the LCD touch monitor is securely attached. The monitor accepts signals in various formats, including XGA for a 15-inch display. Increasing the vertical resolution of the LCD can enhance display quality. Common input types include VGA, SVGA, and XGA, corresponding to their native resolutions.
