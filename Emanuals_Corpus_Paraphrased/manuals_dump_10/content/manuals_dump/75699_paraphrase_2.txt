### Paraphrased Text:

**Chillers GN**: These units efficiently chill cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, thus minimizing bacterial growth. Electrolux chillers are designed to rapidly reduce food temperature from +90°C to +3°C, maintaining food at +3°C during storage. The system operates in various modes—Soft Chilling (down to 2°C) and standard Chilling (down to 20°C)—and continuously monitors the cooling process. **Operating features include** a built-in UV sanitation system (available as an accessory), automatic defrosting, and a countdown timer for service updates (P1, P2 modes), which provide operational insights and keep records for HACCP compliance, even if the process is interrupted unexpectedly. 

### Performance:
The chillers efficiently reduce the temperature from +90°C to +3°C, taking into account food density and chilling type. 

### Construction:
The units are constructed with AISI stainless steel and feature high-density polyurethane insulation that is HCFC-free. They adhere to ISO standards and are designed with rounded corners and IP20 protection for ease of cleaning.
