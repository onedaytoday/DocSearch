### Understanding Microwaves

Microwaves are electromagnetic waves that heat food through agitation of water molecules, leading to effective cooking, defrosting, and reheating. This process allows microwaves to penetrate food uniformly.

**Suitable Cookware:**
- Glass and ceramic containers should be heat-resistant.
- Avoid using metal utensils as they can interfere with microwave functionality.
- Certain plastics may melt; always verify their microwave safety.

**Utensil Guidelines:**
- Use designated microwave-safe materials for optimal performance.
- Cover foods to prevent splatters and ensure even cooking.
  
For further specifics on appliance care and cooking methods, refer to the detailed instructions provided in each section.

**EX-72D UK ENGLISH: COOKING TIPS AND GUIDANCE**

**Before You Begin:**
Make the cooking process as straightforward as using a microwave by following some practical tips. 

**Setting the Cooking Time:**
When defrosting or reheating, make sure the time is shorter than the recommended cooking duration. It's generally better to cook food for less time initially and increase it as needed.

**Starting Temperature:**
Ensure that the food is at the appropriate starting temperature—this varies for defrosting, reheating, and cooking, typically around 0°C to room temperature for fresh food.

**Cooking Times:**
Cooking times can vary based on the food type and whether it has been seasoned with salt, spices, or herbs. Seasoning enhances flavor, particularly on the outer layers of food.

**Microwave Usage:**
- **Combined Cooking:** Microwaves may operate using multiple functions simultaneously, effectively heating food. 
- **Cooking Tests:** Use a food thermometer to check if food is adequately heated. For instance, meat should be clear of juices and flaky for fish. Overcooking toughens the texture.

**Cooking with a Food Thermometer:**
To ensure food is cooked properly, an internal temperature check is essential. For items like poultry, the recommended safe minimum internal temperature must be reached.

**Additions and Skin Coverage:**
Foods with skins or shells (e.g., tomatoes) should be pierced to prevent bursting. Fats can influence cooking; consider how they layer within containers to avoid issues.

**Blanching Vegetables:**
Blanch vegetables quickly to preserve color and texture. Once blanched, immediately cool in ice water and store in an airtight container.

**Large and Small Quantities:**
When preparing food in microwaves, adjust cooking times based on the portion size. A good rule of thumb is to multiply cooking times based on the quantity.

**Container Selection:**
Choose round or oval containers to facilitate even cooking, as they minimize overcooking in corners.

**Covering Food:**
Cover food while microwaving to enhance heat circulation and reduce cooking time. Certain foods, like roasts, require covering.

**Handling Irregular Shapes:**
For irregularly shaped food, ensure even heating by positioning thicker parts outward and stirring as needed.

**Food Arrangement:**
Space food apart in the microwave to allow for even cooking. Stir or turn items midway through cooking for best results.

**Standing Time:**
After microwaving, allow food to sit briefly to ensure even temperature distribution, enhancing the flavors and textures.

**Ready-Prepared Meals:**
When reheating, ensure they are covered to retain moisture and heat evenly.

**Thawing Guidelines:**
Thawing times vary—thicker items require more time and should be closely monitored to prevent uneven cooking.

**Cooking Fresh Vegetables:**
Cook fresh vegetables quickly to retain nutrients and flavor. Season as you would normally.

**Cooking Meat, Fish, and Poultry:**
Ensure these items are thoroughly cooked and safe, using temperature checks as a guide.

**Defrosting Techniques:**
Monitor defrosting closely; some foods may cook during warming. Follow guidelines for even thawing.

**Microwave Cooking Guidelines:**
Input cook time in seconds and adjust settings as needed, ensuring you're aware of how your model operates.

**GRILL Functionality:**
The GRILL feature is intended for browning. Follow initial guidelines carefully to prevent burning or uneven cooking.

**DUAL GRILL Usage:**
This combines microwave and grill functions for optimal results. Adjust settings accordingly for the best cooking experience.

### EX-72D UK ENGLISH RECIPES: MICROWAVE ADAPTATION GUIDELINES

When converting recipes for the microwave, consider reducing cooking time by one-third to one-half. High-moisture items like meat and poultry can be cooked in the microwave without issue. For foods such as braised items, the recommended cooking time should decrease to approximately two-thirds. If necessary, significantly lower the amount of fat used in these recipes, particularly for low-fat dishes.

#### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

These recipes can be modified as needed, unless otherwise specified. Each dish's preparation and cooking instructions are thoroughly detailed and must be followed closely.

#### ABBREVIATIONS

- **DFC**: Defrost
- **DF**: Combined operations for microwave cooking

Ensure the microwave settings align with the food type and cooking method. Foods that require browning, like meats, may require shorter cooking times due to the microwave's nature.
