### Preheating the Oven for Meat and Toasting

Set the oven to the proper temperature for either meat or toasting. Ensure the food is positioned centrally on the cooking rack directly under the heat source. For reference, consult the Service Force Grilling Chart for recommended cooking times for various foods like rashers, chops, and whole fish such as trout or mackerel.

### Using the Second Oven

The second oven is designed for baking. Preheat it to 100°C for items like cakes and pastries, optimizing the cooking process. Instructions for using the second oven can be found in the D2160-1G manual. To turn it on, set the dial from 'O' to the desired temperature.

### Key Points to Consider

Before cooking, ensure the oven has reached the set temperature. The internal light will indicate when the oven is actively heating. Arrange dishes so that they fit properly, with clearances in the front for optimal airflow and cooking efficiency.

### Tips and Guidance

For best results, utilize the appropriate shelf, counting from the bottom up. Leave sufficient space between the top of the food and the oven ceiling to ensure even cooking, particularly for baked goods. Use enamelware or heavy baking trays to enhance browning. Avoid using rough cookware, as it can disrupt heat distribution and extend cooking times.

### Main Fan Oven Cooking

The main fan oven offers efficient cooking and should also be preheated before placing food inside. Follow the recommended cooking temperatures, adjusting them downward by 20°C to 25°C when necessary for batch baking.

### Telescopic Runners (if equipped)

If using telescopic runners, ensure shelves are inserted correctly for full stability. Products must be purchased from Service Force (BAZ D02) if necessary.

### Oven Cooking Chart

The cooking chart lists guidelines by type of food and required temperatures. For precise results, adhere to the internal temperature recommendations specified for each food type.

### Defrosting Functionality

The defrost feature enables safe thawing of food without heating. It is ideal for items like cakes with icing or cheesecakes. For optimal results, manage the thawing process according to the thickness of the food being defrosted.

### Helpful Hints for Food Preparation

To reduce bacterial growth during food handling, purchase the freshest products, and store them properly. Always adhere to appropriate cooking instructions and use a meat thermometer to ensure that meats reach safe internal temperatures.

### Care and Cleaning Instructions

Always allow the cooling fan to function before turning off the electricity supply. Use gentle cleaning agents appropriate for your oven's finish and avoid acidic cleaners as they can damage surfaces. For cleaning the outer surfaces, a soft cloth will suffice. 

### Cleaning the Oven Interior

Use designated cleaners for the oven's interior, being mindful not to scratch surfaces. Properly remove and replace wire frame runners according to manufacturer instructions. For the inner glass panel of the door, handle carefully to avoid breakage.
