### Cooking and Operating Guidelines for Oven Use

To achieve the optimal consistency in dough and cakes, it is important to follow specific cooking methods and temperatures. Cooking times and temperatures can vary based on whether the food is on upper, middle, or lower shelves in the oven. For meats, it is crucial to avoid overcooking, which can occur at high temperatures (200°C - 230°C). White meats generally benefit from lower temperature cooking (150°C - 175°C).

It’s essential to adjust cooking techniques based on whether you’re roasting, baking, or cooking with steam. Position the meat directly on the appropriate shelf and monitor its preparation closely. Once cooking is complete, allowing the meat to rest will help retain moisture and improve texture.

Pre-heating the oven is an important step before starting to cook any dish and should be done according to the type of dish being prepared. Here are examples of dishes organized by category:

- **Cakes**: Whipped cream, shortbread, apple cake, Christmas cake, etc.
- **Bread and Pizza**: Various types.
- **Meat**: Whole meats, shoulder cuts.
- **Fish**: Trout, sea bream, salmon.

Ensure the oven is properly preheated and kept closed during cooking for effective results. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

To maintain optimal performance and safety, the oven should be cleaned regularly. Always disconnect the power before commencing cleaning to prevent electric shock or fire hazards. Use only recommended non-abrasive cleaners and cloths for internal surfaces; avoid bleach or strong chemical cleaners. If the oven components become heavily soiled, it may be necessary to use specialized cleaning products.

### Light Replacement and Troubleshooting

If replacing the oven light, ensure that the specifications are followed (W/25W, 300°C, E14 type). Disconnect the power supply, unscrew the light cover, and replace the bulb as needed.

Should you encounter any issues, ensure the light and cooking functions are properly set and the oven is correctly wired to the power supply. Consult the manual for troubleshooting tips specific to the model.

### Technical Specifications and Compliance

This oven adheres to European Economic Community (E.E.C.) directives regarding safety and electrical compliance. Ensure that the installation area meets the required space and temperature guidelines to prevent overheating and provide adequate ventilation.
