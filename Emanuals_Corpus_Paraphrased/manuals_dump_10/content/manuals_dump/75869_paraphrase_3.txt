**FI22/10FA FI22/10SA Safety and Operational Guidelines**

These guidelines contain essential information for users to ensure safe and effective operation of the appliance. It’s crucial that all users, especially children and individuals with limited physical or cognitive abilities, are aware of these instructions to prevent hazards such as suffocation and electric shock.

When using the appliance, ensure that there are no obstructions that could lead to accidents. Follow the manufacturer’s services and maintenance instructions rigorously to avoid risks related to overheating or electrical malfunctions. Additionally, avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight and ensure that food products are not placed directly on the cooling surfaces.

For optimal performance, allow the appliance to sit upright for at least four hours before use. Adequately maintain the appliance by keeping it clean and free from frost buildup, which can detract from efficiency. The specified cleaning frequency should be adhered to, using appropriate cleaning agents that are safe for the appliance material.

Ensure that the appliance is properly connected to a power source, and if issues arise, consult the troubleshooting section or contact authorized service technicians for support. Maintain proper food temperature and placement, as recommended in the technical specifications, to prevent spoilage and enhance efficiency.

These guidelines, including electrical safety compliance with E.E.C. directives and proper servicing procedures, should be consistently followed to maintain optimal functionality and safety.
