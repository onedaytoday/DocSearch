Additives and detergents should be appropriately selected based on the type of laundry—whether white, colored, or delicate. For optimal cleaning results on household items, it's essential to use non-biological products for whites, while color-safe bleaches should only be applied selectively to colored fabrics. When utilizing stain removers, products like Vanish can effectively target tough stains.

The choice between traditional powders and liquids depends on the washing machine's capabilities. Always refer to the recommended guidelines for dosage and application, ensuring correct placement in the machine. Fabric conditioners are also available to enhance softness and manage static cling.

Warnings regarding synthetic items indicate that improper washing could produce hazardous conditions. For drying, follow the indicated cycle settings in accordance with fabric type, and manage loads to prevent creasing or improper drying.

If pre-wash or stain treatments are required, use the respective options on the control panel, along with appropriate settings for rinse and spin cycles. Ensure to monitor the light indicators to confirm selected actions and phases of operation.

In case of troubleshooting, flashing lights on the control panel may signify specific errors, which should be resolved by checking the drainage hose and ensuring proper connections. Always prioritize safety and proper method adherence to avoid issues like leaks or equipment malfunction.
