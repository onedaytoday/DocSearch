### Installation Instructions

#### General Safety Information
Ensure adherence to NFPA54 standards for clearances around the service area and combustion components at the back of the heater. The Mantis High-Efficiency unit requires specific positioning to facilitate easy service access while maintaining optimal performance. 

**Specifications**

- **Model**: PV28SV50 BTU/HR (KW/H)  
- **Rear Height**: Connection to VAC 60HZ 5A. 

When installing, ensure there is adequate clearance for inspection and servicing. Proper distances from the heater casing to adjacent walls must be observed to prevent combustion issues. 

**Installation Recommendations**

For **Direct Venting**:
- Select a location that permits the heater's proper operation; install clearances to ensure safe service access. 

**Warning**: Failure to position the heater at required clearances can lead to malfunction. Avoid placing the heater directly on carpeting or other combustible materials.

**For Single Flue Systems**:
- Similar clearance requirements apply to ensure safe heating and easy maintenance.

#### Specifications Continued

- **Required PVC Cord**: #PVVK-SH  
- Optional with Surround: #PVE-1, Top Short: #PV4H  

Ensure that the specified clearances meet Comfort Inc.’s standards for ongoing serviceability. 

**Installation Dimensions and Requirements**

Use the provided dimensions for installations involving masonry fireplaces and direct venting systems. If a trim around the heater is necessary, employ the surround kit (PVE-1) and adjust the measurement accordingly.

#### Log Set Installation Instructions
Follow positioning guidelines for the log set to optimize combustion efficiency and minimize soot buildup.

#### Venting Assembly
Utilize the recommended PVC parts for venting installations. Ensure that all connections are properly cemented to maintain integrity and safety.

#### Warning Notes
Stay compliant with U.S. building codes regarding venting height and clearances. 

**Direct Venting Options**: 
Implement specific venting components like the termination cap (PVVTC) and ensure protective measures are in place to prevent obstruction by roofing elements.

#### Final Assembly and Testing
Connect all components securely, ensuring they align with manufacturer specifications to guarantee efficiency and safety during operation.

**PVVTC Termination Cap Vent Kit Installation from Comfort Inc.** 

This kit includes PVC components designed for optimal installation. When using the termination plate (PVCT), ensure you follow the PVC cement application instructions. The optional PVVTC cap model must be ordered separately. For installations requiring an exhaust transition plate, utilize PVC cement to secure it to the designated chase or mounting plate with four screws, adjusting to the appropriate height.

For the **PVCT Collinear Transition Vent Kit**, provided by Comfort Inc., it’s essential to note that the air intake P-trap and elbows must be supplied by the installer and should maintain a minimum height for proper use. Ensure you utilize outdoor-grade sealers for all transitions.

**Direct Vent Installation Instructions:** 
To enhance serviceability, avoid gluing the gas supply elbow purchased from models PVVK-24H or PVVK-48H. During installation, confirm that the flue center lies at the specified minimum exterior grade. The exhaust opening must be oriented downward.

If the unit is placed directly on carpeting or surfaces other than specified flooring, ensure adequate floor protection. For units with existing conditions that meet flue center minimum requirements, no hearth is necessary.

**Gas Connection Installation Instructions:** 
The gas supply line should connect to the top of the heater, allowing easy access for service. Ensure that the hose or supply line enables straightforward inspections and servicing.

**Safety Checklist Before Operation:** 
Before operating the appliance, carefully evaluate the following checklist and adhere to all procedural instructions. Any repairs should be handled by qualified technicians familiar with Mantis High-Efficiency heaters. Interrupt the gas supply immediately if any issues are detected.

**Lighting Instructions:** 
Follow the provided guidelines to light the heater safely. Ensure all switches are correctly positioned before igniting. If ignition fails, troubleshoot as necessary, paying close attention to the LED indicators that signify operational status.

**Conversion Instructions:**
For converting from LP propane gas to natural gas (or vice versa), ensure that the gas supply is turned off. Disconnect relevant components and follow the specified procedures using the appropriate tools for reassembly. Confirm that the system operates correctly once reconnected.

In each installation and operational step, safety must be prioritized to prevent fire, explosion, or injury. Always consult the full instruction manual for comprehensive procedures and specific warnings.

The quantity and height of the heater's functions operate approximately every hour, generating a hissing sound during specific modes. This sound lasts for a few seconds, corresponding with the operation of the L.E.D. light located at the front (43B). The heater may switch off automatically, influenced by the performance of the Mantis heating system, which utilizes fumes from combustion to maintain heat. The exhaust is re-circulated to restore warmth.

The FRBTP, FRBTC, and TRW battery-operated remote thermostats provide separate functionalities. The installation instructions should remain with the owner for future reference. The wiring schematic specifies the connection for both switches and the heater. Black and white wires indicate polarity, and both switches must be in the ON position to operate correctly. Ensure the switches are OFF before turning off the heater.

Connection instructions outline wiring between optional controllers and the junction block setup, where components like the transformer and burners are detailed. The system must be properly grounded in accordance with ANSI/NFPA and CSA standards to prevent shock hazards.

The Mantis High-Efficiency heater features an overheating protection mechanism, enabling a shutoff at approximately 80°C (176°F). This safety measure ensures that the heater cools down adequately before reactivation. Regular inspections and maintenance are advised, particularly before the heating season, to maintain operational efficiency. Any unusual performance should be referred to a qualified technician to prevent potential warranty issues.

Curing the heater post-manufacture involves painting procedures essential for durability. Regular cleaning is also recommended, using household cleaners to eliminate accumulated dust and dirt. Adhering to maintenance protocols, including careful handling of components, ensures longevity and performance.

Installation and servicing should only be conducted by qualified personnel, as improper installation can lead to operational issues such as incorrect gas pressure or improper log placement. Such problems can trigger automatic shutoffs or overheating. If issues arise, switching both controls to the OFF position may reset the system, with indications from the L.E.D. light facilitating troubleshooting.

The heater should be checked and cleaned regularly to ensure efficient operation. The heating element's location is crucial; therefore, it should be inspected annually to prevent heat build-up, which can affect performance and functionality. Follow the installation instructions for the surround assembly, attaching it with the provided screws around either the bottom or top of the heater. The main convection fan and combustion air intake slot are also essential components. If the heater encounters issues, it may become inoperable; ensure the switch is accessible for troubleshooting, located at the rear of the unit. Prior to any maintenance, disconnect the main power.

For the pedestal installation, follow the guidelines for assembling the unit at the location of the heater. Attach using three screws and washers to secure the assembly properly. 

Important components include several parts such as heat shields, gaskets, burners, valves, and electrical components, all of which require specific ordering. 

**Warranty Information**: The heater includes a warranty covering defects in workmanship for specified periods following the purchase date. Service responsibility lies with the owner, particularly regarding shipping and repair costs. Additionally, the warranty does not cover certain conditions.
