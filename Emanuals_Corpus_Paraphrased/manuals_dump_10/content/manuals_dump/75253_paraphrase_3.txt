### SECOND OVEN

The second oven heats the top and bottom, optimizing cooking for various foods. Ideal for baking cakes and preparing other dishes, it operates at temperatures starting at 100°C. 

**USING THE SECOND OVEN:** 
To activate, switch the knob to 'O'.

## DEFROSTING

This feature allows for defrosting food without applying heat directly to it. It is particularly effective for items like cheesecakes or those with icing. 

### USING THE DEFROST FEATURE

**Important Notes:**
- The defrost cycle can be interrupted at any time, and the internal light will remain on during the process.
- Ensure you place food in the correct spot for efficient defrosting. The rate of defrosting is affected by the temperature of the surrounding environment.
- Thawing times vary based on the type of meat; for example, thin slices or minced meat will defrost more quickly than thicker cuts. Keep a close eye on the progress.

After defrosting, it’s crucial to cook the food immediately. Do not refreeze defrosted items or leave them to cool down before cooking, as this can increase the risk of bacterial growth.

### HINTS AND TIPS FOR BUYING AND PREPARING FOOD

- Follow best practices for food safety to minimize bacterial risk when buying, reheating, cooling, and defrosting food.
- Purchase the freshest products or those that are well-packaged.
- Insulated packaging helps maintain food safety during transport.
- Pay close attention to cooking instructions to ensure food heats evenly. Generally, all food should be reheated to at least 70°C to ensure safety.
