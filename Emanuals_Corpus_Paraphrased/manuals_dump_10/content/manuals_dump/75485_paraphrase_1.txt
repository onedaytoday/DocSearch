### START and A: Earth Continuity 
Check: NO YES NO YES  
**Rectify** and B: Insulation **Rectify**, as necessary. Carry D: to Earth. Carry C: The electricity supply should be satisfactory.  

**SOCKET PLUG (with cover) Earth FUSE**  

**A. EARTH CONTINUITY CHECK**  
Ensure the appliance is powered and check the continuity of leads from earth to earth; they must remain more secure than the earth wires.  

**B. INSULATION CHECK**  
Make sure the appliance is electrically disconnected, and switches are turned ON. If readings indicate continuity, proceed cautiously. If leads show infinite resistance to earth (E), it suggests proper isolation.  

**NOTE**: If any issues arise during testing, you must inspect the components for signs of burning or arcing. Each switch should be verified for correct polarity—confirm that ‘N’ and ‘L’ from the supply are appropriate—with earth properly connected.  

Light should indicate correctly from each terminal, ensuring complete insulation coverage of high-tension (HT) leads and proper functionality of the switches.  

### Commissioning Procedure  
Begin by adjusting the controls to the MAX and MIN settings, then switch from MIN to MAX. If lights go out or extinguish, follow the troubleshooting steps outlined. 

**Procedure**:  
Adjust the settings to MIN. The screw located on the device requires a thin screwdriver. Steady the screw until the desired reading is achieved when switching from MIN to MAX. Ensure all components, including the injector, are properly set up, turning on the supply for testing. Record the readings accordingly and then turn off the FO screw.

### Conversion from LPG  
Ensure the appliance is adequately converted for use with LPG, following specific guidelines. The procedure must be initiated with the power supply turned OFF. Adjust LPG injectors as necessary.  

### TO ADJUST THE GAS RATE  
Using a thin screwdriver, adjust the screw found on the rating plate of the appliance.  

**IMPORTANT**: Regular checks on the adjustment should be adhered to for optimal operation.
