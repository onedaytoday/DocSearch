Observe all safety precautions while handling electrical components. Only authorized personnel should perform service work on the unit to maintain warranty coverage. The operating temperature specifications should be strictly followed to ensure optimal performance.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

When cleaning the touchscreen, use a soft microfiber cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners or direct application of substances that could damage the screen. Regular maintenance checks are advisable to ensure long-term reliability.

### Regulatory Compliance

This device complies with FCC regulations regarding electromagnetic interference. Users are advised to follow installation guidelines to minimize potential interference with other devices. For detailed compliance information, refer to the official documentation provided by the manufacturer.

If you experience interference with reception or performance, you may need to power off the device. 

**Absorption Rate**  
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Industry Canada (IC) monitor compliance regarding the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), which measures the amount of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body, considering factors like age and health. The SAR is a critical parameter; the U.S. places limits on allowable SAR values during testing. The maximum SAR recorded complies with FCC and IC standards; if interference occurs, you can try the following steps to mitigate it: 

1. Move the device away from the affected receiver.  
2. Reorient the device in relation to the affected receiver.  
3. Move other nearby receivers if applicable.  
4. Change the plug to a different AC outlet.  
5. Unplug and check any leftover I/O connections that may generate high RF interference.  
6. Ensure that the device is connected to a grounded outlet to minimize RF and shock risk.

**Bluetooth SAR Details**  
The Bluetooth device (model SW602113 C) generally operates below the SAR threshold. This compliance is pertinent to maintaining a reliable wireless connection and limits RF exposure. The recommended SAR for devices in the European Union is set below established guidelines, with testing confirming compliance with standards EN 50360, EN 62209, and EN 301 489, according to the EC R&TTE Directive 1999/5/EC.
