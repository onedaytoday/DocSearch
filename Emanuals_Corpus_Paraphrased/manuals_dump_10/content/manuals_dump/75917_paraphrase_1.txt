### Building Integration

The layout and orientation of the cooker are designed to manage the heat radiated from below. The radiated heat can impact performance; thus, it's crucial to position the vehicle facing south whenever feasible, as this allows for optimal heat and combustion management. It's important to ensure that the area beneath the vehicle remains unobstructed to maintain efficient cooling and prevent performance declines. Refer to the technical data for detailed specifications.

### Ventilation Requirements

Proper ventilation is essential, especially during high-temperature operations. Fresh air should flow through designated openings immediately around the recess, ideally maintaining temperatures around (C) as illustrated in the specifications. Access for inspection and repairs should be straightforward without needing to remove the appliance from the recess. When installing external components, ensure they are adequately protected against debris and sealed to prevent winterization issues. The flow of air should also be regulated to maintain appropriate conditions.

### Technical Specifications

1. **LP Gas Connection**: 
   The LP gas type must meet specific operational criteria. Check that the gas is provided at the appropriate pressure as indicated on the reducing valve. The gas supply should be connected to approved fixtures, ensuring a safe operation. Use only recommended fittings and avoid push-on connections for permanent setups.

2. **Electrical Connection**: 
   All mains voltage wiring within the caravan must conform to current I.E.E. regulations, utilizing designated outlets and couplers. Electrical components must be correctly earthed. The wiring color codes are as follows: Green-and-yellow for earth, blue for neutral, and brown for live connections. Ensure that all connections adhere to local regulations, and pay particular attention to the orientation of wires to guarantee safety and compliance. It's imperative that the appliance is grounded appropriately.

### Mounting Instructions

For proper installation of the front frame, follow the provided guidelines and diagrams to ensure stability and security during use.
