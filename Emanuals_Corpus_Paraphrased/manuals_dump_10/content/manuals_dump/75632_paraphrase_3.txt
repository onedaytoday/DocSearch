**Shelf Guidelines and Cautionary Measures:**  
Ensure proper placement on the shelf. Handle with caution, especially at the front of the bottle. Follow safety instructions for shelf management carefully. Avoid using steel wool or any non-specific cleaners on stainless steel surfaces, as this can damage the finish. Use high-quality, all-in-one cleaners and polish to maintain the appearance. If discoloration occurs, choose Bon-Ami or a similar cleanser. Abrasive pads can compromise the stainless steel's grain, so it’s vital to adhere to guidance on cleaning. Never use chlorine or bleach-based products. Disconnect the cooler before cleaning.

For installation, ensure screws are secured tightly at the desired location on the shelf top. If service is needed within the warranty period, contact Customer Service for assistance. Details regarding the service and warranty can be obtained through the manufacturer's official channels.
