**Cooking Operation and Safety Guidelines**

When cooking, the switch activates or deactivates the heating function within seconds. If the cookware becomes too hot, the unit has an overheating protection feature that will automatically turn off the cooking function, signaling this with audible alerts. To safeguard against accidental activation, especially where children are concerned, a child lock feature can disable the controls.

It is crucial to ensure that the cooking surface is free from obstructions, such as cloths or cookware, as this may interfere with functionality. The highest heat setting can be managed through the On/Off controls. If the cooking surface is obstructed or not functioning correctly, immediate assistance from a service technician is recommended.
