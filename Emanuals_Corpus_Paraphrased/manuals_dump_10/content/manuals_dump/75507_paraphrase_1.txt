### Instructions for SLIP-IN D/O Cooker

**Introduction**  
This document is aligned with the British Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It is imperative to follow these instructions thoroughly to ensure safe and effective use of the cooker. Please read this guide carefully before operating the appliance.

**Lighting the Hotplate**  
To ignite the hotplate, ensure the battery is installed correctly. Turn the control to the highest setting and press down the ignition button, releasing it immediately after the hotplate ignites. **Warning:** If the flame goes out, turn off the gas immediately to prevent gas accumulation. Always keep the hotplate covered when not in use.

**Cooking Techniques**  
Regularly monitor the food as it cooks. Adjust the heat settings appropriately for different food types. Start with high heat for foods like toast and then transition to low for denser items like stews. It’s important to use the appropriate shelf levels based on the thickness of the food being cooked.

**Preheating**  
Preheating is essential for optimal cooking results. Allow the cooker to reach the desired temperature before placing food inside, particularly for baked goods and dishes requiring even heat distribution.

**Hotplate Usage**  
Activate the hotplate by setting the temperature from 'OFF' to 'HIGH', then down to 'LOW' as needed. Be cautious with heavy cookware that can warp. If a fire occurs, smother it with a cloth — do not use water.

**Shelf Arrangement**  
Ensure food is spaced adequately on the shelves for proper heat circulation. Adjust shelf positioning according to the type of food being prepared. It’s crucial to avoid overcrowding, which can lead to uneven cooking.

**Roasting**  
When roasting, avoid covering meat, as this restricts heat circulation and can prevent even cooking. Allow sufficient space for the heat to reach all surfaces of the food.

**Cooking Chart**  
Refer to the cooking chart for guidelines on preparing various dishes. Ensure that food is fully thawed before cooking, especially meats and poultry, to ensure even cooking.

**Food Preparation**  
For tougher cuts of meat, a longer cooking time at lower temperatures is recommended. Utilize a meat thermometer to verify that the internal temperature reaches at least the required safe cooking temperature.

**Reheating**  
Food should be reheated thoroughly and only once, ideally using a conventional or microwave method to retain texture and flavor.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure safe, efficient, and high-quality cooking outcomes with your SLIP-IN D/O cooker.

**Cleaning Instructions**

Maintain cleanliness by regularly cleaning the hotplate and surrounding areas. Use only recommended polishes and cleaners. Reference the dishwasher’s operating instructions when using cleaning cloths. For the hotplate, ensure you clean the top using appropriate methods and materials if the indicator light is on. Properly clean the crowns and ensure they are free from food residue, which may create burns if not addressed. 

If the crowns require deep cleaning, utilize a suitable scouring method that allows for effective cleaning without damaging the surfaces. When reassembling, position the crowns centrally and ensure they are correctly fitted to prevent any operational issues. 

Maintain the cooker’s appearance by adhering to suggested cleaning intervals, which typically include spotless maintenance after each use. Regularly clean shelves and allocate time to ensure they remain in optimal condition which may require a clean every few hours, depending on usage.

**Outer Cleaning Guidelines**

When cleaning the outer surfaces of the cooker, it is essential to first detach any top screws carefully. Use appropriate screwdrivers and be cautious to not over-tighten or damage the screws. Always allow the appliance to cool before handling any components.

**Safety and Regulatory Compliance**

Follow all relevant safety standards and guidelines to prevent risks of fire or damage. Ensure proper ventilation when using the cooker and avoid placing it in areas susceptible to moisture or heat sources unrelated to its design. 

**Installation Guidelines**

Ensure that installation adheres to specified dimensions and clearances per appliance type. Use the appropriate components as outlined, and follow instructions for leveling and securing the appliance to maintain stability.

**Maintenance and Servicing Information**

Regularly keep the appliance serviced according to its operating manual. Should issues arise, consult the service hotline to arrange professional assistance. 

**Specifications**

Refer to the technical data for dimensions, connection types, and electrical specifications. Ensure that the installation complies with the latest regulations, including those from the British Standards.

### GAS CONNECTION

To connect the gas, follow these guidelines: use only liquid sealants when attaching the inlet gas pipe to the reset valve; avoid P.T.F.E. sealant tape. Ensure the gas supply is properly situated below the hotplate, and that the hose is adequately sized. 

**Important:** The flexible tubing must comply with the latest edition of British Standard (BS) regulations. LPG flexible connections should be specifically designed for LPG and capable of operating under the defined pressure, featuring a red stripe, band, or label for identification.

### INSTALLING THE BATTERY

The battery compartment is located in the front plinth. To install the battery, access the compartment from the front; the battery holder accommodates AA batteries, positioned on the right side as indicated. If necessary, use a tool to assist with installation.

### PRESSURE TESTING

Conduct pressure testing by removing the front and back covers. Gently ease off the right cover while ensuring the FSD (flame supervision device) phial remains connected to the injector. Activate the gas supply and adjust the thermostat and hotplate. Ensure all connections are secure.

### GRILL CHECK

To check the grill, turn it on and observe that the gas flows correctly after releasing the control.

### HOTPLATE CHECK

Inspect the hotplate by ensuring the crowns are correctly seated. Turn the hotplate on and release the control to confirm proper operation.

### LID CUT-OFF DEVICE RECHECK

Turn on the hotplate. The gas supply should activate when the hotplate is turned on and turn off simultaneously when the hotplate is deactivated.

### MAIN OVEN CHECK

Set the thermostat to the appropriate setting. The oven should ignite correctly and the FSD should function, allowing gas flow to the burner while maintaining safe operating conditions.

### SECOND OVEN CHECK

For the second oven, rotate the thermostat counterclockwise to the desired setting. Ensure that gas ignites effectively and that the FSD not only heats up but also allows for gas flow throughout.

### GENERAL NOTE

This manual details the operational guidelines for the RENOWN D/O SLIP-IN. Ensure proper installation and operational checks are conducted as described.
