**Essential Information for Microwave Cookware**

When using the microwave for cooking and reheating, select items that are specifically labeled as microwave-safe. Suitable materials include Corningware, heat-resistant plastics, microwave-safe ceramics, and stoneware. Itâ€™s advisable to preheat your microwave if needed. Do **not** use non-heat-resistant plastics, as they can warp or leach harmful substances.

For optimal cooking and reheating, it's important to cover food appropriately. Use microwave-safe covers to retain moisture and heat effectively, ensuring food cooks evenly and prevents splattering. Avoid tightly sealing covers, as this can lead to excessive steam buildup, hindering proper cooking.

**Microwave Features Overview**

The microwave is equipped with a transparent window, and it shouldn't be opened while in operation. The turntable, which rotates food for even cooking, should be securely in place. Lights indicate operation, and are controlled via the touch panel.

To set or reset the clock, touch the "Clock" button followed by inputting the desired time. If an error occurs, use the "Stop/Clear" button to attempt to rectify it.

**Cooking Procedures**

For manual cooking, select the time and cooking power, typically high for most items. Refer to the cooking chart for specific foods to ensure proper cooking times.

**SENSOR MODES**
