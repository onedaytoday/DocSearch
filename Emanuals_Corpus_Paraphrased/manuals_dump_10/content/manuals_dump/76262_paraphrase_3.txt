### DELAY TIMER Functionality

Ensure the machine is powered off before proceeding. While the PRE-WASH and DELAY TIMER settings are active, the timer can be adjusted in hourly increments. Press the PRE-WASH button followed by the DELAY TIMER to increase the wash time by one hour. This process can be repeated as needed.

### Door and Additive Instructions

To close the door, press the DOOR/LIGHT button. A red light indicates that the door is not correctly closed; it should be securely latched. During the washing process, ensure that the correct compartment for additives like detergents and starch is used, filling to the maximum level as specified.

If RINSE HOLD is selected, press START/PAUSE to start the rinse cycle or switch it to DRAIN or START/PAUSE to operate it accordingly. The DOOR/LIGHT indicator will illuminate to show that the door is secure.
