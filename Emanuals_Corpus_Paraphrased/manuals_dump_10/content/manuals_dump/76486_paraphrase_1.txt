### Tumble Action Washer Instructions

#### Safety Information
These instructions provide essential information regarding the operation, service, and safety precautions of the Tumble Action Washer. It is crucial to record the washer’s serial and model numbers, which can be found on the top of the unit.

#### Important Safety Guidelines
To prevent serious injury, fire, or electrical shock, adhere to the following precautions:

1. **Proper Grounding**: Ensure the washer is correctly grounded to avoid electrical hazards. Never eliminate the grounding feature.
  
2. **Chemical Compatibility**: Do not mix bleach with other household cleaners or chemicals, as this can lead to dangerous reactions.

3. **Preventive Measures**: Always follow the operating instructions to minimize risks associated with fire or electric shock while using the washer.

4. **Child Safety**: Keep children away from the washer and educate them about its safe use. Ensure that the washer is installed in a location that limits children’s access.

5. **Avoid Overloading**: Do not tightly pack items. Overloading can cause mechanical failures or damage.

6. **Chemical Safety**: Use only the recommended amounts of bleach and ensure it is added properly to avoid damaging clothes or causing harm.

#### Operating Instructions

1. **Sorting Laundry**: Sort items by color and fabric type—wash whites separately from colors, and heavier items like towels from lighter fabrics.

2. **Detergent Use**: Use the manufacturer’s recommended amount of detergent. Too little can impair cleaning efficiency, while too much can result in residue buildup.

3. **Bleach Application**: Follow guidelines for bleach usage, ensuring it does not come into direct contact with clothing unless specified.

4. **Dispenser Functionality**: Open the dispenser drawer carefully, avoiding premature dispensing of bleach or softeners to ensure they mix appropriately during wash cycles.

5. **Treatment of Stains**: For tough stains, promptly pre-treat with appropriate cleaning solutions before washing. Refer to specific treatment recommendations for different types of stains.

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Greasy Residue**: Check if you are using undiluted detergent or bleach directly on clothes. Ensure to wash items thoroughly and check water temperature settings.

- **Static Cling**: This may occur from washing synthetic fabrics together. Sorting fabrics based on material types can help prevent this.

- **Fabric Tears**: Ensure no sharp objects are left in pockets and avoid overloading the washer with heavy items.

Following these instructions and precautions will ensure safe and efficient operation of your Tumble Action Washer.

To clean the washer and prevent buildup, follow these instructions: Turn off the water supply and wipe the exterior with a cloth. If stains appear, use a solution of bleach and water to clean affected areas. The interior and detergent compartments should be cleaned monthly. Start by cleaning the front and back of the washer cavity, ensuring that bleach residues are thoroughly rinsed out. Clean the recess to prevent odor buildup.

When using the washer, avoid overloading it, as this can lead to noise and inefficient washing. If water collects slowly, check the supply hoses for kinks or blockages, ensuring they are unobstructed and connected correctly. Set the water heater to at least 130°F (70°C) to provide adequate cleaning power.
