### SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS  

**WARNING**  
Proper electrical information is crucial for safety. Ensure the refrigerator is directly connected to a properly grounded outlet with a three-prong grounding plug to prevent shock, in compliance with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) regulations. Using an extension cord or a two-prong adapter is *NOT RECOMMENDED*. If issues arise or the performance is affected, it may void the warranty. Before servicing, ensure the power is disconnected via the switch or cord.  

### INSTALLATION  

Select a location that allows proper airflow around the unit—ideally, temperatures should be within 0°C to 32°C (32°F to 90°F). Clearances are necessary for service accessibility. Ensure that the refrigerator is level to function correctly and prevent issues such as improper cooling, frost buildup, or noise.  

### COOL DOWN PERIOD  

Allow the refrigerator to stabilize for several hours before storing food to ensure optimal cooling.  

### TEMPERATURE CONTROL  

Positioned at the factory, the temperature control assists in maintaining sufficient food storage temperatures.  

### INTERIOR LIGHTING  

The interior light activates when the door is opened and turns off when closed.  

### ADJUSTING SHELVES AND STORAGE  

The shelves can be adjusted for flexible storage options, while door bins can be tailored to fit various items. Deli drawers and humidity controls (in some models) maintain specific storage conditions.  

### FOOD STORAGE GUIDELINES  

To maximize storage and energy efficiency, avoid overcrowding shelves. Wrap meat securely and store items properly to minimize odor transfer.  

### CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE  

Use gentle cleaning methods; avoid abrasive materials that could scratch surfaces. Regularly thorough cleaning maintains performance and hygiene.  

### WARRANTY INFORMATION  

This warranty covers defects and malfunctions under normal use. Consumers are responsible for service costs and normal maintenance. It excludes incidental damages. This warranty is valid only in the United States and Canada.

If service is required, refer to the terms provided, and maintain this document for your records.
