### Instructions for SLIP-IN D/O

**Introduction**  
This document pertains to compliance with the British Council Directive 90/396/EEC and the proper use of the cooker by those operating it. The instructions below are designed to ensure safe and effective cooking. 

**Lighting the Cooker**  
To ignite the hotplate, ensure the battery is correctly installed. Turn the control knob to the highest setting and press the ignition button immediately, then release it. **Warning:** If the flame goes out, turn off the hotplate and allow it to cool before attempting to re-light.

**Cooking Instructions**  
- **Heat Settings:** Adjust the hotplate from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then to 'LOW' as needed for various cooking tasks. Regularly monitor the food being prepared.
- Use higher settings for rapid cooking, such as toasting, and lower settings for thicker foods. Position the food accordingly on the shelves based on its thickness.
  
**Shelf Utilization**  
Ensure items are spaced appropriately on the shelves for optimal heat circulation. Preheating is recommended for certain foods such as baked goods. The position of shelves should allow for adequate heat distribution.

**Roasting Guidelines**  
When roasting, avoid covering meat or poultry to prevent heat restriction. This ensures each item cooks evenly. It's crucial to follow cooking times closely, especially for larger cuts of meat.

**Cooking Charts and Food Recommendations**  
Refer to the cooking chart for specific recommendations regarding different food types, including time and temperature settings. Always ensure food is fully thawed before cooking and consider its placement on the shelves for even cooking.

**Additional Cooking Tips**  
- Use a meat thermometer to verify that meat has reached the minimum safe temperature.
- For soups and stews, bring ingredients to a boil before reducing heat for simmering.
- When reheating, use conventional ovens or microwaves, and ensure food isn't reheated more than once.

These guidelines are designed to help you use the cooker efficiently and safely, ensuring the best cooking results.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

**Connecting to Gas**  
Ensure that the R/8 connection is made to the B.S.P. threaded port located beneath the hotplate. **Important:** Only liquid sealants are permitted for the inlet gas pipe when connected to the reset valve; do not use PTFE sealant tape. Verify that the supply is adequately pressured. The flexible tubing must meet the latest BS standards. LPG flexible connections must be suitable for LPG and can operate up to the specified limits, featuring a distinctive red stripe, band, or label.

**Fitting the Battery**  
The battery compartment is situated at the front plinth. To install the battery, remove the front cover and position the AA battery in the right direction, as indicated. If necessary, access the compartment from the front.

**Pressure Testing**  
Remove the front and back covers to expose the internal components. Carefully detach the F.S.D. phial while easing off the injector. To test the supply, adjust the thermostat and light the hotplate. Ensure proper functioning of the system. Turn off the device and replace the cover, ensuring the F.S.D. is correctly positioned.

**Checking the Grill**  
Light the grill and observe the ignition sequence and functionality.

**Checking the Hotplate**  
Confirm that all burner crowns are properly seated. Light each burner on the hotplate, ensuring they ignite correctly.

**Checking the Lid Cut-off Device**  
Activate the hotplate and ensure gas supply is cut off when the hotplate lid is closed.

**Checking the Main Oven**  
Set the thermostat and ignite to verify proper operation. The F.S.D. should be adequately heated to allow gas flow.

**Checking the Second Oven**  
Adjust the thermostat counterclockwise and ignite to ensure proper operation. The F.S.D. should bypass and operate correctly to allow gas flow.

**General Note**  
Refer to the specifications and guidelines related to the deviceâ€™s operation, including cover details, as indicated for the RENOWN D/O Slip-in model.

**Description**  
Printed documentation is available for components such as the P.C., hotplate operation, and battery specifications.
