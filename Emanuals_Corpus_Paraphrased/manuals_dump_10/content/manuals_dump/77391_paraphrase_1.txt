**Preparation:**
- Required tools: Hand or power drill with a Â¼-inch drill bit, flat-blade screwdriver, wire cutter/stripper, and optionally, a spirit level or plumb bob (the thermostat does not need to be level to function).

**Caution:**
- Ensure that power is off to the circuit to avoid electrical shock when working on the thermostat.

**Removing the Old Thermostat:**
- The thermostat is comprised of three main parts: cover, base, and switching mechanism.
- Detach the cover straight off the base without forcing it. Disconnect wires carefully.
- When removing the old thermostat, ensure that wires do not drop back into the wall.

**Mounting and Wiring:**
- Follow the included template for mounting.
- Utilize appropriate anchors if existing screws are loose or damaged.
- Connect wires according to the specified terminal references provided, ensuring connections are secure.

**Thermostat Configuration:**
- This thermostat is set for heat/cool use out of the box.
- For heat-pump systems requiring the thermostat to switch, adjust the GAS/ELECTRIC switch to ELECTRIC.
- Verify proper functioning by testing heating and cooling modes.

**Thermostat Operation Check:**
- To test heating, switch to the "HEAT" setting; the heating light should illuminate, and the system should activate.
- For cooling, switch to "COOL"; the cooling light should flash, indicating operation.

**User Options and Features:**
- Adjust temperature settings using the provided buttons.
- The thermostat can display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius based on user preference.
- Utilize the configuration menu to customize thermostat settings, including heating rates and location settings for energy efficiency.

**Troubleshooting:**
- For issues like blown fuses or non-operation, verify wire connections and ensure power is supplied correctly.
- If problems persist, consult the troubleshooting guide for corrective actions based on symptoms observed.

**Specifications:**
- Electrical Ratings: Operates at 24VAC and draws a specified current (consult model data).
- Thermal Ratings: Suitable for specified temperature ranges and conditions.

**TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**  

**Symptom:** 

**Corrective Action:**  

1. Switch the thermostat to "Cool." Ensure the thermostat and wiring are securely connected.
2. If the thermostat clicks but does not switch between Heat, Cool, or Fan modes, check for any short circuits in the wiring.
3. If the system operates correctly in one mode but not in others, consider service for the Heat/Cool operation. 
4. Verify the placement of the thermostat; it should not be located in areas that can cause false readings, which may affect the operation of both heating and cooling systems.
5. Adjust the thermostat settings as needed, referencing manufacturer instructions to optimize heat and cooling cycles.
6. If cooling is inconsistent or fails, check the thermostat location again as it could be impacting performance.
7. Ensure the thermometer within the thermostat is functioning properly and not tripped.
8. If issues persist, consult troubleshooting resources or visit www.white-rodgers.com for further assistance.
