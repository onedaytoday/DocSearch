### Paraphrased Text

Cakes generally require a temperature range of 175°C to 250°C for proper cooking. The dough must be thoroughly cooked and then garnished accordingly. It is crucial to select the correct cooking method for various types of cakes to achieve the desired consistency without overcooking. The dough must be placed on the appropriate rack to ensure even cooking, while also considering the type of meat cooked alongside, preventing the risk of it becoming overdone. White meat benefits from lower-temperature cooking around 175°C.

When cooking, ensure that the food is adequately supported on shelves and that the cooking environment retains sufficient moisture. Avoid direct steam on the food unless necessary, and ensure proper heat resistance for the materials involved. Always refer to charts and guidelines for pre-heating and cooking specifics based on the type of dish being prepared.

Cleaning instructions indicate the importance of disconnecting the appliance from the power supply before maintenance to ensure safety. Use appropriate cleaning materials, such as cloth or leather, to avoid scratching surfaces. If damage is noted, repairs should be performed by authorized service personnel.

Instructions for shelf cleaning detail the removal of screws and careful handling to prevent electrical hazards. Replacement bulbs must conform to specific wattage and temperature ratings. 

For technical support, if issues arise with service or functionality, follow troubleshooting guidelines to verify wiring and thermostat settings. Ensure all installations comply with local regulations, particularly regarding electrical safety.

The built-in installation must integrate seamlessly into the designated space, ensuring proper coverage and insulation as required. For any persistent issues, detailed service contact information should be followed to address different country-specific regulations and ensure warranty protections. 

In summary, this document offers comprehensive guidance on cooking techniques, cleaning procedures, and safety instructions, essential for efficient operation and maintenance.
