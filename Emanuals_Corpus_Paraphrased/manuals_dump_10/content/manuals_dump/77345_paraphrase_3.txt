By adhering to these instructions, you can ensure safe and effective use of the MT3600 and MT4000 models.

**WARNING:** The ANSI safety standards may not fully align with the features designed to reduce the effective risks during operation. Users should be alert to any abnormalities in equipment performance and respond promptly. It is critical to ensure that components are assembled properly and securely, especially regarding throttle operation. Refer to the Carburetor Section for pertinent guidelines.

**SAFETY RULES:**
When cleaning the equipment, ensure it is securely positioned and emptied of fuel. To minimize the risk of burns or other injuries, maintain a safe distance from moving parts.

**ASSEMBLY:**
Assemble the equipment with care, ensuring that protective gear is worn during operation. Follow the instructions in the Safety and Operation Sections. Proper assembly of the clutch components is essential, ensuring correct placement and tension adjustments using the appropriate screws.

**OPERATION:**
Monitor chain tension regularly. The chain should turn freely by hand; if overly tight, adjust the tension screw counterclockwise. New chains may stretch and require frequent tension checks, particularly following initial use. 

**FUEL REQUIREMENTS:** 
Use unleaded gasoline with an octane rating meeting recommendations. Avoid using automotive oil or 2-cycle outboard oil. Store fuel in tight, cool containers and discard older fuel appropriately.

**WORK PRECAUTIONS:**
Maintain a clear work area free from hazards. Ensure all personnel are aware of the operational procedures and potential risks. Use hearing protection and inspect equipment before use, addressing any issues promptly.

**STARTING PROCEDURE:**
Follow the specific steps outlined for starting the engine, using the on/off switch correctly. Be prepared to manage the throttle after ignition to prevent flooding the combustion chamber. 

**TROUBLESHOOTING:**
In case of flooding, turn off the ignition, remove the cover, and clear any blockages in the combustion chamber before reassembling and restarting. 

**Note:** The chain should never turn at idle. Adjust the RPM settings accordingly to maintain safe operation.

### Chain Operation and Safety Guidelines

#### Chain to Safety-Chain Section
Ensure that your equipment is properly set up as outlined in Sections (A) and (B) below. Follow these operational steps:

1. **Securing the Equipment**: Use both the throttle and the back handle securely while operating. Maintain a correct grip throughout the rotation.
2. **Servicing**: Regularly check and service the equipment, ensuring that the front and right sections are functioning well.
  
**Warnings**:
- If any issue arises during operation, stop immediately and consult the servicing guidelines.
- Take precautions during adverse conditions, such as high winds or heavy weather.
- Be cautious of notching and back-cutting techniques; ensure no heavy wires are in proximity.
- If the tree presents danger or excessive tilt, retreat immediately.

#### Tree Cutting Instructions
1. **Preparing the Area**: Before cutting, clear debris around the tree’s base and assess the terrain for obstacles. Identify any weak points such as rot or loose stones that could impact the fall.
2. **Making the Cut**: Establish a notch (referred to as (C)) to guide the tree's fall. Ensure this cut is made straight and at the appropriate angle.
3. **Backcutting**: Execute the backcut (illustrated in (D)), ensuring it's slightly above the bottom of the notch for a safe drop (approximately 1-2 inches).
4. **Watch for Pinching**: Keep an eye out for the saw becoming pinched. If this occurs, break the cut or reposition to escape danger.

**Warnings**:
- Avoid cutting trees that lack support or are unstable.
- Never let another person operate while you are cutting.
- Always maintain clear footing and workspace during the operation.

#### Maintenance Procedures
1. **Chain Maintenance**: Chains require routine inspection and maintenance to ensure efficiency. If the chain binds or the teeth get damaged, adjust as needed.
2. **Sharpening**: Follow correct sharpening techniques to avoid accidents. Improperly sharpened chains can cause kickback.
3. **Inspecting Wear**: Regularly check for wear, damaged components, and clear debris from the teeth. Replace any parts that are beyond repair.

**Warnings**:
- Never operate the equipment without following the manufacturer’s generated specifications.
- Handle all components with care to prevent injuries from sharp or fatigue-prone parts.
  
#### Additional Maintenance
1. **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure that your equipment conforms to CARB and EPA standards for performance and emissions.
2. **Cooling System**: Regularly clean the cooling system to avoid overheating, which could lead to catastrophic failures.
3. **Fire Safety**: Be mindful of fire hazards due to unmaintained components or excessive heat, and ensure tools are handled safely to prevent ignition.

It is crucial to follow the above operational and maintenance protocols carefully to ensure your safety and the effectiveness of your equipment.

### Maintenance Guidelines

- Ensure maintenance on the shield cover (D) and the screws (F and G). Clean and inspect part (A), then reassemble all components and secure the screws.
  
**WARNING**: If there are any issues with the assembly, such as damage or improper installation, it could pose a fire hazard or impair hearing. If the shield or any part appears worn or degraded, replace the assembly with the complete part number 50050204A (G). 

- It’s crucial to mount parts correctly to avoid potential dangers. 

**WARNING**: If the clutch cover or any components are excessively worn, particularly when the band is too thin, this can lead to failure. Repairs should only be performed by authorized service personnel using parts sourced from reliable vendors.
