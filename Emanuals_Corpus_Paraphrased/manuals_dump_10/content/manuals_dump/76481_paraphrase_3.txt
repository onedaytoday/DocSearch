**TM and Water Notice:** If you have purchased the TM and Water unit, please review the following information. The water supply should be turned off at the fresh food compartment, and it is advisable to consult the factory settings for proper operation. Refer to the Water Works section to ensure correct installation through your vendor or Consumer Assistance. The RG-100 and NGRG-2000 Ice and Water units have been rigorously tested for compliance with ANSI/NSF performance standards by NSF International, a respected health organization. Regular maintenance ensures that you receive optimal performance without contamination from unknown sources. Keep in mind the rated capacity, service flow (GPM), and rated PSI to maintain quality water supply throughout the device’s lifespan. 

**Food Storage Recommendations:** Store fresh food at or below 40°F to prevent overcrowding in the refrigerator as this can hinder airflow and cooling efficiency. Properly wrap meat and other perishable foods to avoid cross-contamination and freezer burn. Foods should be arranged to allow sufficient airflow, ensuring that stronger odors do not penetrate others. Overcrowding should be minimized to enhance airflow and efficiency.

Familiarize yourself with the normal sounds, such as water flowing through hoses, fan operation, or defrost heater noises. If you hear any unusual sounds, refer to the manual for guidance. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance Instructions:** To maintain efficiency, clean both sections of the appliance regularly using appropriate cleaners, avoiding strong abrasives that could cause damage. Ensure proper light functionality and address any build-up promptly. 

**Replacing Light Bulbs:** Use caution when replacing light bulbs; unscrew the light cover and replace it with the correct bulb type.
