### General Information 
**Installation and Initial Operations**: Only qualified professionals should undertake installation and servicing, ensuring compliance with local electrical supply regulations and standards (ANSI Z223.1/NFPA and CSA B149.1). Familiarize yourself with the operation to ensure safe usage. 

**Owner Responsibilities**: Regular maintenance and compliance with operating guidelines must be upheld by the owner, including annual checks by authorized personnel.

**Proper Usage Guidelines**: Utilize the equipment exclusively for approved cooking methods. Avoid using it for food preparation that requires heating sealed cans or bottles, as this may lead to explosions. Investigation into burning incidents should be undertaken, with appropriate firefighting measures readily accessible.

### Technical Data
**Gas Consumption**: Ensure systems are tested conforming to ANSI/NSF standards and comply with food service regulations.

#### Specification Plate
- Each unit carries a specification plate located on the right side, detailing appliance type and serial number (e.g., YWWXXXXX).

### Operating Instructions
**Description and Construction**: The tilting braising pan is designed for multiple cooking methods and is equipped with advanced control features. Ensure proper setup and initial heating as outlined in the operational instructions.

#### Initial Operation
- Clean the unit thoroughly before first use. Heat to 320°F (160°C) to prepare for cooking. 

**Automatic Control Features**: Follow specific instructions to program cooking times and temperatures. Each function can be managed through easily accessible controls.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**: After use, units should be turned off and cleaned appropriately while ensuring safety protocols are followed to mitigate fire hazards.

**Troubleshooting**: Any operational issues should be documented, and maintenance should be performed following manufacturer guidelines, ensuring the unit remains functional and safe for use.

Here's a paraphrase of the provided text in a more concise and technical manner:

When the SOFT function is deactivated, heating is optimized for foods with high thermal conductivity, minimizing the risk of burning. Activating the SOFT mode adjusts the heating based on the food type, preventing sticking. The clock time (AZ) and cooking time (AT) are displayed, and the HACCP compliance can be monitored with the appliance options. Pressing the HACCP button (C) illuminates the relevant signals for monitoring.

To operate, turn the switch (Z) to initiate heating. The (TT) button can be pressed to disable the cooking process. Ensure that the cooking resembles the standards for meat (starting at 200°C/392°F), poultry (initially at 140–160°C/284–320°F), and vegetables. When roasting, the food should be positioned about one inch from the bottom for effective heat distribution, and to avoid burning.

Cleaning should be performed when the device is off and cooled. Use non-abrasive cleaning supplies to remove food residue and grease. Follow recommended procedures to maintain appliance efficiency and prevent malfunctions. If error codes arise, such as E1 or E2, acknowledge and address them by referring to service instructions. Compliance with safety regulations and cleaning protocols is crucial for safe operation.
