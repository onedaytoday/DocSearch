### OVEN LIGHT Feature
The OVEN LIGHT provides theatrical illumination that can be adjusted for brightness. The lights activate automatically based on door status and intensity settings. To turn the lights ON or OFF, press the OVEN LIGHT CONTROL LOCK. The door lock will engage after a few seconds or once cooking is complete, indicated by a flashing DOOR LOCK. The control lock requires pressing for a few seconds to activate.

### SETTING THE KITCHEN TIMER
You can set the kitchen timer to manage cooking durations. Press TIMER to activate it, and follow prompts to set your desired time. The timer's countdown will be displayed and will flash once it's started. If the timer sounds, you can easily cancel or reset it anytime.

### BAKING
Baking ranges from 170°F to 550°F, with a common setting of 350°F. For effective preheating, follow the instructions to heat the oven properly. When setting to 350°F, press OVEN, followed by BAKE, and then START. The display indicates when preheating is in progress and when the desired temperature is reached. Cancel this operation if needed.

To set to 425°F, repeat similar steps as before: OVEN, BAKE, and START.

### COOK DURATION
The COOK DURATION function allows for automatic cooking cycles. Once the time is set, the oven will turn off once the countdown finishes. This function is compatible with multiple cooking methods, including Convection, Warm, and Defrost. To initiate COOK DURATION, follow the steps outlined previously, and you can cancel anytime.

### END TIME
The END TIME feature allows scheduling the oven to turn off automatically at a specific time. Similar to COOK DURATION, the function supports various cooking modes. Configure it in the same manner as COOK DURATION, and cancel as needed.

### BROILING
Broiling utilizes high heat, ideal for cooking meats and achieving a browned exterior. Set the oven temperature between 300°F and 550°F. Preheating is recommended for effective cooking. When broiling, turn the food for even cooking and avoid covering the oven to prevent grease fires.

### CONVECTION BAKING
Convection baking circulates hot air within the oven, promoting even cooking. The temperature range and instructions for preheating are similar to standard baking. Foods may require reduced cooking times; consult the Convection guidelines for specifics. 

### RAPID PREHEAT
This feature expedites preheating. Set between 170°F and 550°F, it is essential to follow the outlined steps for effective function. 

### CONVECTION ROASTING
This method is excellent for roasting meats with consistent heat distribution. Set the oven between 170°F and 550°F as previously described. Properly seat roasting pans to enhance heat flow, and consult the Convection Roasting Chart for specific meat guidelines.

### WARM OVEN
The WARM OVEN function maintains food at a set temperature range of 150°F to 190°F. Use it to keep foods hot until serving time. To activate, follow the standard steps for setting the oven. Cancel the function as needed. 

### SAFETY NOTE
In case of fire, do not attempt to extinguish it without proper means; turn off the oven and contain the situation as necessary.

### SLOW COOKING
This function allows for the gradual cooking of foods using a slow cooker like a Crock-Pot, preventing items from burning. Cooking can be set to high (HI) or low (LO), with times ranging from a few hours to continuous operation. **Tips**: Ensure foods are fully thawed before cooking. Use a food thermometer for recommended temperatures to ensure proper cooking. Preheat the oven when using this function by pressing the OVEN button, then SLOW COOK, HI, or START.

### DEHYDRATING
This function circulates heat to dry foods at controlled temperatures between 100°F and 225°F, typically at 120°F. **Tips**: Preheat the dehydrator and monitor the drying process. To activate, press OVEN, then DEHYDRATE and START. The DEFROST function can thaw items like cakes without applying heat.

### BREAD PROOFING
This function activates yeast to proof dough at temperatures ranging from 85°F to 100°F. **Tips**: Preheat the oven before use. To activate this function, press OVEN, BREAD PROOF, and START.

### TEMPERATURE PROBE
This feature allows for monitoring the internal temperature of foods to ensure they are properly cooked. It operates between 130°F and 210°F, with an ideal target of 170°F. **Important**: Ensure the probe is placed in the thickest part of the food, avoiding bones. After the food reaches the set temperature, use COOK OPTIONS for additional preparations.

### MULTI-STAGE COOKING
This function enables a sequence of three cooking methods, allowing for combinations such as Convection and Proof. Choose options according to the nutritional needs of the food: Convection, BAKE, or BROIL, and follow the prompts to start each stage. You can cancel at any time.

### USER PREFERENCES
This section allows customization of features such as clock settings and operation preferences. To set the clock, press USER PREF, then CLO, and follow the prompts. To adjust the temperature display between Fahrenheit and Celsius, select the respective option in USER PREF. Audio controls are also available, with options to silence or adjust sound levels during operation.

### MY FAVORITES
This feature stores up to three favorite cooking settings for easy access. To save a setting, press OVEN, then BAKE, choose the desired cooking options, and press START. To overwrite a favorite, select it and confirm the new setting by pressing the MY FAVORITE button.

### SABBATH FEATURE (FOR JEWISH SABBATH HOLIDAYS)

The Sabbath feature is designed for use during Jewish Sabbath holidays. To activate this feature, select the baking mode. Indicators confirm that the setting has engaged correctly. When this mode is active, the oven remains on continuously for a factory-set duration of 12 hours. 

Beware: if the oven light turns on, it means the feature is engaged. If the light goes off, the feature is also inactive. It is crucial to use the "BAKE" function only when the Sabbath mode is active. The only available options during this period are "START" and "CANCEL." Press "BAKE" to set the temperature (for instance, 350°F) and "START" to initiate cooking.

To continue cooking, both "HI" and "LO" buttons must be pressed for at least a few seconds until the indicators illuminate. If you want to set the oven to a higher temperature, you can do so by pressing "OVEN" followed by pressing "START" twice.

### CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS

Avoid cleaning the oven while the self-clean feature is active. Ensure it has cooled down adequately before manually cleaning. Use appropriate protective gear and keep children away during the cleaning process. Never use harsh cleaners or coatings that might damage the self-cleaning mechanism.

### STARTING A SELF-CLEAN CYCLE

To begin the self-cleaning process, shut the oven door and press the "CLEAN" button. Select from LIGHT, MEDIUM, or HEAVY cleaning options and confirm by pressing "START." The door lock will engage automatically during this operation. Post-cleaning, allow the oven to cool before opening the door.

### GENERAL CLEANING TIPS

Regular cleaning of spills and heavy soil will reduce tougher cleaning later. Use cloths suitable for the oven's surfaces and avoid using abrasive pads that may scratch. Always ensure the oven is off and cool before starting any cleaning task.

### STAINLESS STEEL CARE

For maintaining the appearance of stainless steel, refer to the specific cleaning guidelines provided in the manual. Handle the oven door carefully during removal and installation to avoid damage.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

For issues related to the operation of the oven, including error codes or if the oven does not operate, refer to the troubleshooting section. Common problems may include blown fuses, interruptions in electrical supply, or issues with the oven light and self-clean cycle. 

Proper handling of cooking and cleaning processes is essential to prevent excessive smoke or flames. If these occur, adjust meat placement for optimal results and follow suggested guidelines for safe cooking practices.
