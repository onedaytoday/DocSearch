### Important Information About Food Preparation in the Microwave

When using the microwave for cooking or reheating, it’s essential to ensure that food is heated evenly and thoroughly. Always heat bottles and food in proper containers, such as microwave-safe glass or ceramics, while avoiding non-heat-resistant plastics. Following recommended guidelines can help prevent burns and ensure safe feeding practices.

**Microwave Safety Guidelines:**
1. **Cookware:** Utilize materials like Corningware or microwave-safe plastics. Avoid non-microwave-safe items to reduce risks during heating.
2. **Reheating:** Use microwave-safe lids to cover food and prevent spattering. Do not leave food uncovered in the microwave, as this may lead to uneven heating or splatters.
3. **Heating Bottles:** Ensure that baby bottles are heated gently to prevent burns and ensure safety when feeding.

**Microwave Operation:**
- The microwave is equipped with a turntable; make sure it's in place during operation to ensure even cooking.
- Use clear microwavable covers when heating food, and do not remove them while the microwave is running.

**User Instructions:**
- Set the time and power level accurately. Refer to the control panel for the function you intend to use, such as defrosting or cooking specific foods.
- To operate, select the desired cooking function on the control panel and press "START." Pay attention to the timer and sound cues indicating completion.

**Power Level Management:**
- Adjust the power levels based on the type of food. For instance, high power (P-100) is suitable for most cooking tasks.
- Use the power level pad to select lower settings for defrosting or gentle cooking processes.

**Cooking and Reheating Protocol:**
- For optimal results, preheat the microwave if necessary. This ensures that the food cooks evenly.
- Follow the provided cooking charts for specific food types to determine the recommended heat duration and power level.

**Fast Recipe Functions:**
The microwave features quick cooking options for various food types, including:
- Meats and poultry
- Breads and grains
- Vegetables and snacks

These preset functions simplify the cooking process, ensuring that food items are prepared efficiently.

### Conclusion

**Microwave Operation and Features**

To operate the microwave, press the "High" button once, then press "3" followed by "4," and finally "Off." To turn on the light, press the "Light" button once. Adjust the cooking time as needed using the cooking timer or clock functions. If the child lock is activated, it prevents unauthorized use by locking the controls. For convenience, features like the timer and sound options can be adjusted accordingly.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

To maintain the microwave’s exterior, clean the plastic surfaces with a soft cloth and a suitable household cleaner. The door and control panel should also be wiped down regularly, ensuring that no abrasive materials are used to avoid damage. For stainless steel models, a gentle cloth cleaner is recommended. Inside the microwave, avoid harsh cleaners or scrubbing pads to prevent scratches. The waveguide cover, located within the cooking cavity, should be kept clean to ensure optimal performance; wipe it down immediately after any food splatter.
