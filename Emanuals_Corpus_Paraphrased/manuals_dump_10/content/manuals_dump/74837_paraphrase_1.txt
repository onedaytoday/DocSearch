**General Information & Safety and Usage Instructions**

**Installation and Initial Operation**
Proper installation in accordance with authorized guidelines is essential, including connecting to an appropriate electrical supply. The installation must be overseen by qualified personnel who will assume responsibility for its proper operation. Adhere strictly to the operating instructions and safety warnings provided.

**Owner Responsibilities**
The owner is responsible for ensuring that the appliance is inspected and serviced by authorized personnel at least once a year.

**Usage Guidelines**
Foods should be cooked according to their specific requirements. Only trained personnel should handle closed containers at elevated temperatures to prevent risks such as explosions. Care should be taken to avoid overheating, as this may lead to fires; use a cloth or cover to smother any flames.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**
Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning or conducting maintenance. Annual servicing is recommended, involving safety checks and general upkeep.

**Technical Specifications**
Reference PNC Appliance Types:
- 9CHG583299
- 9CHG583300
- 9CHG583301
- GXWBOEOOOO, etc.

**Packaging and Environmental Considerations**
Ensure proper disposal and recycling of packaging materials.

**Testing and Certification**
The appliance meets UL and NSF/ANSI standards.

**Specification Plate**
Important information, including the serial number, is located on the specification plate on the right side of the unit.

**Operating Instructions**
Each tilting pressure braising pan features a polished stainless steel exterior and a multi-functional cooking area designed for browning, steaming, and pressure cooking. The cooking process can operate efficiently from 100°C to 109°C (212°F to 228°F).

**Initial Operation**
Before use, thoroughly clean and heat the appliance to approximately 160°C (320°F) to prepare the cooking surface. Follow specific protocols for different food types and maintain proper hygiene and equipment care.

**Standby Operation**
Check all settings and ensure the lid is properly secured to maintain performance. During heating, monitor temperature conditions and avoid opening the lid unnecessarily.

**Automatic Control Features**
The appliance includes intuitive controls that facilitate programming for various cooking modes. Users can monitor and adjust settings, engage safety features, and confirm operational status through visual and acoustic indicators.

**Final Steps**
Once cooking is complete, disengage power and follow recommended shutdown procedures. Ensure all indicators are turned off and the unit is properly cooled down before maintenance. 

For any technical issues, consult authorized service personnel.

Here's a paraphrased version that maintains the technical meaning of your original text:

**Operating Instructions:**

To extinguish the (LS), switch off the (H) (if desired). Shift from to The cooking process finishes once switched off. When the function buttons (TT), (DT), and (ZT) are activated, the switch (S) turns off the respective functions that were previously in use. If the switch is turned off, the device will cease operations. Additionally, pressing the Soft (R) reduces power supply to the food. The (LR) light indicates that the (R) is switched off. Once cooking is complete, the (Q) displays will show Food (AT) (AD) and the (AZ), with an acoustic signal indicating completion (refer to the Troubleshooting section). Typically, with the SOFT function deactivated, the food is heated in the most efficient manner. High heat conductivity elements ensure even cooking without burning. When the Soft function is activated, heating is adjusted based on the food type. The CLOCK TIME (AZ) displays the time, while the (AT) indicates operational status.

These appliances may analyze cooking processes with the optional HACCP feature. The status lights of (LC) and (HP) will signal changes in the cooking phase, which are reflected in the (TT) and (AT) displays. To stop cooking, press the HACCP (C) button. The system will showcase operating instructions and provide updates during usage via buttons (T), (D), and (Z). Cooking can be interrupted by pressing the (TT) button.

For mechanical tilting operations, switch from to I. The (LS) light indicates the correct position. Empty to the right and return to original settings to adjust the outlet position at the front. This requires turning the switch clockwise, and ensuring it is secured to prevent unintended operation. Select the appropriate mode based on cooking needs, with temperature settings ranging from 212°F (100°C) for regular cooking to 394°F (250°C) for pressure cooking.

The cooking process will automatically shut down once it reaches specific parameters, with the (H) indicator extinguishing once disconnected from power. Ensure the lid is locked properly during steam operations. The steam release feature should only activate when the lid is securely fastened. 

**General Guidelines:**
Maintain the lid locked throughout cooking to prevent splattering. Specific temperature settings maximize cooking effectiveness while preventing burning. The SOFT function is designed to adapt based on the food type and minimize frothing. For best results, monitor cooking closely, especially with high-temperature foods, to prevent sticking.

Specific cooking methods include initial roasting of meats at 391°F (200°C), steaming at 284°F to 320°F (160°C), and poaching at 176°F (80°C). For optimal performance, food transitions through three cooking phases: pre-heating, cooking, and cooling. Ensure a proper setup with perforated trays (GN1/1) to facilitate even cooking and prevent overflow or sticking.
