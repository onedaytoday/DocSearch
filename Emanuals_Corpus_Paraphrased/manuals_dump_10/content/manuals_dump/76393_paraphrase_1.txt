**Paraphrased Text:**

When using black clothing and additives, it’s important to follow the recommended guidelines for maintaining the appearance of fabrics in both household items and laundry. This includes sorting whites and colors correctly, using non-biological detergents, and avoiding bleach on delicate fabrics. For tough stains, products like Vanish In-Wash or GloWhite are advisable.

You can choose traditional powders or liquids, applying them correctly as per instructions, which are usually found on the packaging. Fabric conditioners can enhance the softness of laundry, and it's crucial to adhere to the guidance for both the washer and the detergent used.

Be cautious of loading limits, especially with synthetic items, to prevent issues such as fire hazards. Muted colors or synthetic fibers should be handled with care, ensuring they are not mixed with other types.

Drying settings vary based on the fabric type, and the drying cycles indicated in your manual should be followed. Heavily soiled items require thorough cleaning, while lighter washes may use reduced durations. Check the drying cycle for specific guidelines, particularly for items like towels.

In terms of managing creases, distribute items evenly in the washer. For additional stain treatment, utilize stain action products without exceeding the maximum load.

To select appropriate wash settings, use the buttons provided to adjust spin speeds and other options, such as pre-wash or extra rinse features, based on the fabric type. The delay start function can also be set to allow for pre-programmed washing cycles.

If an error display appears, follow the instructions for troubleshooting. Problems with water supply or drainage should be addressed by checking for blockages and ensuring all connections are secure.

For effective cleaning, periodic maintenance of the washing machine is essential, including cleaning hoses and ensuring no debris is obstructing water flow. Each component must be kept in good condition to prevent operational issues.

Finally, for significant malfunctions, refer to service guidelines or contact support for assistance.
