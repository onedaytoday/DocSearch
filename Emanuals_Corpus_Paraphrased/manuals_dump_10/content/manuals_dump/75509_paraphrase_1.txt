### Paraphrased Technical Instructions

The ESEC lights indicate when the heating elements are active. They illuminate when the unit is hot and turn off once it has sufficiently cooled down. If the ESEC light is flashing or remains on, it indicates that the unit needs attention. It is crucial to allow the element to cool completely before resuming operation. Should you encounter functional issues, please contact a qualified service provider.

When utilizing the ESEC Self-Cleaning feature, ensure that only approved cookware is used as recommended. Proper placement allows even heating, essential for achieving optimal cooking results. For effective heat distribution, each piece of cookware should be correctly matched to its designated heating zone.

The Bridge feature, located at the front, can be used for larger cookware. Always monitor the cookware to prevent overheating, which could lead to food burning or equipment damage. Adjust the settings as necessary—turning clockwise or counterclockwise—based on your cooking needs.

Selection of cookware type is critical, as it affects cooking efficiency. Recommended materials include aluminum, which heats rapidly, and stainless steel, which maintains heat well. Avoid using porcelain-enameled or glass cookware as they can scratch surfaces and limit heat transfer. Ensure proper circulation and spacing between cookware for best results.

The OVEN VENT should never be obstructed, and oven racks must be arranged prior to operating the oven when it is cool. For broiling and baking, follow recommended rack positions for optimal cooking performance.

The Warmer is designed to hold prepared food at safe temperatures. Use appropriate coverings to retain moisture and heat. Be cautious when handling items to avoid burns, and ensure the Warmer is preheated as directed. The light indicators will assist in adjusting the temperature settings (HI, MED, LO) as needed.

For optimal results, allow foods to preheat adequately and avoid overcrowding, which can lead to uneven cooking. Adjust cooking times and temperatures to suit the specifics of each recipe.

For broiling, manage temperatures carefully and do not leave food unattended. Always have a fire extinguisher accessible, and do not attempt to extinguish grease fires with water.

Cleaning practices should be routine. Address spills and heavy soiling immediately to reduce the frequency of deep cleanings. Use appropriate cleaners and avoid abrasive materials that may damage surfaces. Ensure the appliance is off and cool before starting any cleaning procedures. Do not immerse heating elements in water.

By adhering to these guidelines, you’ll ensure a safer and more efficient cooking experience.

**Cleaning Guidelines**

When performing cleaning tasks, ensure that surfaces remain slightly cool. Refer to the Cleaning Chart for guidance on maintaining cleanliness. Utilize a cloth with a suitable cleaning agent to wipe down surfaces effectively.

**Important:**
- Avoid cleaning the oven's internal components or covers that might have become discolored due to age, as these may react adversely to cleaning methods.
- Ensure the appliance is turned off and cooled before starting any cleaning process.
- For cleaning agents, only use those specifically designed for cooking appliances. Avoid abrasive cleansers or materials that may scratch the surface.
- Use appropriate cleaning products like CERAMA BRYTE to protect surfaces from scratches.

**Self-Cleaning Procedure:**
- Follow safety instructions closely when engaging the self-cleaning feature. 
- Ensure the oven is empty, including all racks, before activation.
- Always wear protective gear and allow the oven to cool completely before cleaning again. 
- Avoid using harsh chemicals or protective coatings in conjunction with self-cleaning.

**Hinge and Light Maintenance:**
- Properly secure the cover to the hinge slot with screws to maintain functionality.
- The oven’s light shield must be installed whenever the oven is in use. Ensure the oven is cool before handling the shield.

**Warmer Maintenance:**
- Turn off the warmer before cleaning. Use a gentle cloth to wipe the surface, and do not use harsh cleaning agents. Properly cover the warmer during heating cycles to avoid damage.

In all cleaning scenarios, follow the manufacturer's instructions rigorously to ensure safety and appliance longevity.
