### Food Preparation Guidelines

**General Cooking Tips**  
Food must be thoroughly cooked, allowing for appropriate resting times to enhance heat retention. Utilize high temperatures when preheating or toasting. Adjust cooking times and heat levels based on food thickness and type. When grilling, refer to the Service Force Grilling Chart to determine cooking times for various food items such as rashers, chops, and fish.

### Top Oven Functions

**Usage Instructions**  
The top oven is designed for versatile cooking, including baking cakes and cooking various foods at temperatures starting from 100°C. Set the oven to 150°C using the appropriate selector, and note that indicators will show when the oven maintains its intended temperature.

**Shelf Installation**  
Ensure that the oven shelves are inserted straight and positioned correctly at the back. This ensures optimal cooking conditions.

**Cooking Tips**  
Food should ideally be positioned centrally to allow for even browning and heat distribution. Pay attention to the size and spacing of items to facilitate effective cooking and simplify cleaning. Avoid placing heavy enamelware directly beneath food to prevent excessive browning or uneven cooking.

### Main Fan Oven Functions

**Heating Mechanism**  
The main fan oven circulates heat from the back, ensuring even cooking. Preheating to recommended temperatures significantly improves cooking efficiency, typically requiring a preheat of around 25°C before beginning.

**Batch Baking**  
This oven is effective for batch baking due to its consistent heat distribution. Adjust shelf positions to ensure optimal cooking results for various food types.

**Shelf Placement**  
Install shelves straight and securely against the back of the oven for optimal performance.

**Cooking Recommendations**  
Refer to guides to make necessary adjustments in times and temperatures. Ensure food is appropriately spaced to avoid uneven cooking.

### Oven Cooking and Roasting Charts

Follow the cooking charts for accurate temperatures and suggested cooking times, particularly focusing on internal temperatures ranging from 50°C to 80°C for meats. Utilize the recommended charts for roasting various types of meat, keeping in mind the preferred cooking times.

### Defrost Feature

**Functionality**  
The defrost function is specifically designed to thaw frozen foods, particularly delicate items like cakes and meats. 

**Usage Instructions**  
Select the defrost mode, which will activate and deactivate automatically when required, ensuring a steady thaw. Always defrost meat and poultry thoroughly and cook immediately afterward to avoid food safety risks.

**Defrosting Tips**  
Utilize best practices to minimize bacterial growth during thawing. Foods should be thawed in their original packaging, particularly for thinner items.

### Appliance Care and Maintenance

**Preparation for Cleaning**  
Always allow the cooling fan to completely cool down the appliance before disconnecting it from the power supply.

**Cleaning Materials**  
Use cleaners that are compatible with the appliance’s surfaces. Avoid bleach-based products, as they may damage finishes.

**Hob and Oven Cleaning**  
Regularly clean the hotplate and oven surfaces, ensuring to remove any food residue without scratching the surface. Use appropriate cleaning products to maintain the appliance's integrity.

**Stayclean Surfaces**  
For ovens equipped with Stayclean finishes, manual cleaning is recommended to preserve the coating. Operate at 220°C periodically to maintain effective performance.

### Glass and Internal Cleaning

**Door Maintenance**  
Household cleaners are suggested for cleaning the door glass. For cleaning between the inner and outer glass, carefully remove screws and clean without damaging the finish.

For any additional cleaning tasks, refer to specific guidelines to prevent damage and maintain efficiency.
