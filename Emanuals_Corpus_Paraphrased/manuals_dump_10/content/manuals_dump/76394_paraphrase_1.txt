Dear Customer, please refer to these operating instructions as a primary guide for safe and effective use of your washer-dryer. It is essential that you review the warnings and operational information provided. Familiarize yourself with the various functions and features of this unit, including important details about maintenance and troubleshooting guidance. If any issues arise, please contact the SERVICE CENTRE mentioned in this document.

For environmentally conscious users, be sure to utilize the washer-dryer’s various protection features.

Indicate the drying duration and any additional selections according to needs, and understand how to use the SPIN SPEED and RINSE HOLD options effectively. Cleaning instructions and charts are available for reference, along with troubleshooting assistance for unsatisfactory performance.

Please ensure that only qualified personnel conduct repairs or maintenance; inexperienced handling can lead to serious malfunctions. Follow all safety guidelines when operating the washer-dryer, including ensuring it is properly positioned and connected to a stable water supply. 

Children should not operate the machine unsupervised, and safety measures must be in place to prevent access to controls. 

When doing laundry, adhere to fabric care labels and instructions, avoiding incompatible products, especially with delicate items. 

Most items typically do not require a prewash, and the unit is designed to handle up to the maximum load capacity effectively—usually two-thirds full for optimal operation. 

The machine is set to function with different fabrics, with options for COOL, ECONOMY, and ENERGY SAVING settings. When selecting preferences, the corresponding lights will indicate readiness; if an incorrect option is selected, the lights will alert you by flashing.

Understanding each function is key to achieving the best results and maintaining fabric quality. For example, the PREWASH cycle is intended for heavily soiled items, while the STAIN function is enhanced for stubborn stains. 

When incorporating the DRYING feature, follow appropriate guidelines based on fabric type. The DELAY TIMER can be adjusted for scheduled operation, and the countdown will automatically update to keep you informed.

For safe operation, be aware of the function of the door lock feature; the DOOR light will indicate when it is safe to open. If you need to pause or discontinue a cycle, use the START/PAUSE button accordingly. 

Attention should also be given to the additives compartment to ensure effective use of cleaning agents. 

When sorting laundry, separate items by color and fabric type to preserve quality and prevent damage. Follow washing instructions for specific items to maintain garment integrity.

Compliance with all guidance and the use of recommended products will facilitate optimal washing and drying results.

**Selection Process for Washing Products:**

This section outlines options for choosing between traditional powders and liquids for laundry. Traditional powders can be applied directly to clothing, while traditional liquids require immediate mixing with water. Alternatively, compact powders and liquids, known for their specific measuring capabilities, should be placed in designated compartments in the washing machine—usually the top and back.

**Fabric Conditioners:**

Fabric conditioners can ease care for various clothing types and typically include machine-compatible products. Always adhere to provided instructions for optimal performance, particularly with conditioning sheets like Bounce. Be cautious not to exceed recommended amounts for any washing agents, especially with synthetic items, as this may lead to issues such as fire hazards or undesired chemical formations.

**Drying Instructions:**

Select drying settings based on fabric types—refer to the guide for recommendations on Normal, Reduced Duration, or other drying options based on load composition. Begin by pressing the START/PAUSE button, ensuring thorough rinsing for items like towels. Additionally, avoid overloading the machine to prevent creasing and damage.

**Stain Options:**

For stain removal, employ the STAIN-Action feature, which allows for gentle cleaning without compromising the integrity of the fabric. Use the selection lights to navigate through available washing options, monitoring for the selected features such as EXTRA RINSE or RINSE HOLD.

**Delay Timer and Program Control:**

Utilize the DELAY TIMER feature to pre-set wash schedules, with a countdown display following activation. Press START/PAUSE to initiate, and monitor indicator lights for progress, including any alerts for overdosing or malfunctions.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Regularly clean the machine, particularly the emptying hose, to ensure proper drainage and operation. If issues arise, follow troubleshooting steps for indicated error codes (E10, E20, E40). Ensure water supply and drainage connections are secure.

**Safety Warnings:**

Be cautious with non-stop cycles and additives to prevent issues. If in doubt, consult the user manual for detailed instructions on compatibility and safety. Always ensure that the hose is positioned correctly and that the machine is turned off before any maintenance operations.
