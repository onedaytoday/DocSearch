**Microwave Cooking Overview**

Microwaves are used to heat and cook food by utilizing their energy to create friction, which generates heat. This enables food to be defrosted, warmed, or cooked uniformly. By cooking from multiple angles, microwaves reduce cooking time significantly. Microwaves are especially useful for heating ready-prepared meals, as well as defrosting food effectively. 

You can combine microwave functions with other cooking methods, such as convection or grilling, allowing for a broader range of cooking options. For example, cakes and poultry can be prepared efficiently using these combined functions. 

**Properties of Microwaves**

Microwaves can pass through materials such as glass, ceramic, and certain plastics, but they do not penetrate metal. As a result, only the food contained in suitable dishes gets heated by the microwaves. If food is covered while defrosting, this can help prevent uneven cooking or overheating.

While microwaves cook food, convection heat from the appliance can also aid in cooking, especially for layered dishes. Without microwave assistance, conventional cooking methods may require longer cooking times.

**Microwave Functionality**

Cooking times can be adjusted from seconds to minutes depending on the desired state—whether defrosting or cooking. The microwave's cooking settings are automatically managed when the door is closed and the START/QUICK button is pressed. 

You can adjust the microwave power levels using the MICROWAVE POWER LEVEL button. The timer can be set clockwise for incremental adjustments.

**Cooking Techniques**

Using the GRILL setting, the food can be heated from the top, which is particularly useful for achieving a golden-brown finish. Precautions should be taken, as the cavity and outer surfaces can become hot. To avoid potential hazards, it’s advised to operate the microwave empty during initial use or to switch it to a cooling mode if necessary.

**Convection Cooking**

For convection cooking with preheating, set the appliance to 180°C and select the desired cooking mode. It is essential to preheat before cooking to ensure even results.

For cooking without preheating, temperatures can be set to 250°C directly. Additionally, you can combine convection and microwave settings for dual cooking, optimizing cooking times without sacrificing quality.

**Auto Cook Features**

The LESS and MORE buttons help adjust cooking times and power levels quickly. For example, when using the AUTO COOK feature, you can select options for cooking frozen foods directly.

**Additional Functions**

The START/QUICK function enables you to instantly add cooking time in seconds. For optimal results, always ensure the correct cooking mode is selected before use.

**Safety and Information Checks**

During operation, you can check the cooking settings and power levels as needed. For preheating and cooking, it's also possible to verify the convection temperature.

**Compatibility Notes**

Use microwave-safe materials, including specific glass, ceramic, and certain plastics, while ensuring they can withstand heat without risk of melting or combustion.

**Coffee Preparation**: For the coffee mixture, combine wholemeal coffee with beaten ingredients until smooth. Preheat the oven to 180°C, grease the baking dish, and integrate the mixture thoroughly. Once blended, pour into a greased tray lined with greaseproof paper. Bake for a specific duration, allow cooling, and serve.

**Cherry Cake**: For the cherry cake, lightly grease the baking dish. Beat together grated onions, ground ingredients, and blend until smooth. Preheat the oven to 200°C, cook the mixture until golden, then allow it to cool.

**Onion Gratin**: Thinly slice the onions and combine them with cooked sweetcorn and onion puree in a bowl. Grease the baking dish and layer the mixture. Cook under the grill until topping is golden brown, ensuring even cooking by rotating as needed.

**Automatic Cooking Operations**: Utilize the AUTO COOK, AUTO COOK FROM FROZEN, and AUTO DEFROST functions. Caution: Be aware that food can burn and the oven may overheat during these operations. Ensure the correct weight or quantity is selected as per the cooking chart. If adjustments are needed, use the LESS or MORE buttons. Follow the instructions for optimal results, using the START/QUICK button to begin cooking.

**Cooking Procedures**: For cooking using AUTO COOK (AC-1), press the AUTO COOK button once, then the START/QUICK button to initiate cooking based on the displayed weight.

**Menu Cooking Chart**:
