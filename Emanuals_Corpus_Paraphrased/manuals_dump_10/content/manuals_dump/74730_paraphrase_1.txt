I'm sorry, but the text you provided appears to be a bit jumbled and incomplete. However, I can help rephrase the coherent parts for clarity and technical accuracy. Here’s a refined version based on the discernible content:

**Technical Guidelines for Cooling and Maintenance**

**Cooling Performance:** Be attentive to cooling sounds, such as whirring or operational noises, which indicate normal functionality. Ensure that the food is placed properly to allow adequate airflow, and that items aren’t overly packed, which can obstruct cooling.

**Food Storage Recommendations:** To maintain optimal freshness, foods should be stored in airtight containers. Cool cooked food before placing it in the fridge to prevent overloading it. Pay special attention to certain types of food, such as shellfish or cooked dishes, ensuring they are sealed properly.

**Operational Sounds:** Expect to hear typical operating sounds related to the thermostat and cooling process. If you hear unusual noises or notice ice buildup, frost may have reached an excessive thickness; this may necessitate a defrosting cycle. 

**Cleaning Instructions:** Disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply before cleaning. Avoid using detergents, abrasive cleaners, or wax powders, as these can damage surfaces and leave undesirable odors. Ensure that food items are stored correctly to prevent spillage or contamination.

**Service Information:** For further support or spare parts, contact Service Force at www.serviceforce.co.uk or by phone. It's crucial to address any mechanical issues promptly to prolong the lifespan of your appliance.

**Customer Care Contact:** For queries regarding purchases or services, reach out to the Customer Care Department at High Street SL1 1DZ, Slough.

Here’s a technical paraphrase of your text while maintaining the original meaning:

Within months of the purchase, due to workmanship issues or other options, this product is guaranteed to be FREE OF CHARGE. The guarantee covers proper use and adherence to the specified electrical ratings. Food items should be cooked only if completely thawed. If food is frozen, allow it to defrost completely—usually taking several hours—until the yellow light (B) turns off. To expedite the freezing of fresh food, the fast-freeze option should be activated for a few hours. Service is available through Service Force, and any associated costs will be charged accordingly. Users must follow the provided instructions closely.

Defrosted food should ideally be reheated directly in the microwave, ensuring thorough cooking. Meat and food items need to be distributed evenly to avoid any further issues during operation. The previously frozen food can incur frost or freezer burns if not managed properly. Customers should be cautious regarding any modifications or breakdowns, especially related to the frost buildup. 

In terms of installation, it is critical to position the appliance correctly to prevent young children from being trapped inside if there’s a lock or catch on the door. The appliance should be installed in an area with a temperature range of 10°C (50°F) to 38°C (100°F) and away from direct sunlight. 

Space should be maintained around the back and top of the appliance for optimal air circulation. Proper grounding is essential, adhering to safety standards. Follow the instructions provided in the manual for electrical connections, ensuring correct wiring: green/yellow is for earth, blue for neutral, and brown for live. 

Cleaning should follow prescribed methods, avoiding sharp objects that could damage internal components. In the event of a malfunction, only authorized service personnel should perform repairs. This notice serves as a reminder regarding safety practices and operation guidelines for effective use.
