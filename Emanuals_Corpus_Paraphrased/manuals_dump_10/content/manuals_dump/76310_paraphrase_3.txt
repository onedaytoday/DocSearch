To begin, if you have already selected a memory setting, the previous data will be overwritten. To confirm, press OK. Use the arrow buttons to navigate between options or select an alternate setting. This allows for adjustments to various parameters according to customer preferences. The function allows you to repeat selections, thus increasing or decreasing settings. Depending on your choice, you can select from different item types, such as heavy, normal, or light fabrics. Each setting corresponds to specific temperature ranges as indicated in the provided chart. 

For example, washing temperatures can include 95°C, 60/50°C, 40°C, and 30°C (cold) for synthetic items. Once selected, the respective button will flash to indicate readiness. The display will show current phases and statuses, including when a cycle is locked or interrupted.

If you need to cancel, turn the dial to "O" and press the appropriate button to reset. Should a cycle require interruption, the countdown will pause. For the Night option, the light will turn off after selection, and once finished, a completion message will appear.

Sorting laundry is crucial; separate whites, colors, synthetics, and lightly soiled items. Use specific guidelines for treating stains, such as using bleach only on whites and following care labels closely.

Additives like fabric softeners, pre-wash treatments, or special detergents can be used as specified. The type and amount of each additive should conform to manufacturer recommendations for optimal results.
