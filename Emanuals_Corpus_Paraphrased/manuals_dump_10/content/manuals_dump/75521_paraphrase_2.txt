#### Safety Warnings

- **WARNING:** Failure to adhere to safety protocols can lead to severe injury or even death. Ensure children are supervised and cannot access hot surfaces or cooking equipment.
  
- **CAUTION:** The surfaces can become extremely hot, posing a risk of burns. Keep flammable items, such as cloths and cookbooks, away from the range.

#### Installation and Maintenance

- Have your electric range installed by a qualified technician familiar with the latest **ANSI** and **CSA** standards. Follow specific instructions for grounding to avoid electrical hazards.

- For cleaning and upkeep, do not use harsh cleaners that might damage the cooktop. Always ensure the unit is cool before cleaning, and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe operation.

#### Heating and Cookware Guidelines

Use cookware that fits well and has a smooth, conductive bottom to promote even heating. Avoid using warped or large cookware that may not sit securely on the cooktop. Refer to the cooking guide for appropriate cookware that won’t damage the surface.

#### Canning Instructions

For canning, begin at the maximum temperature to achieve the necessary pressure and then reduce to maintain a steady heat for the required duration. Always consult the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines or the National Center for Home Food Preservation for detailed canning instructions.

**Note:** This manual contains critical information on safe operation and maintenance to ensure your satisfaction and safety while using the electric range. For any further assistance, do not hesitate to contact service support.

The four screens display cooking functions and heating options tailored to different cookware types. The system allows for adjustments to heat levels, including turning off the heating element when it cools. Specific instructions can be reviewed for active cooking modes, including a Sabbath mode.

Cooking performance depends on factors such as the type and amount of food being prepared. Caution should be exercised around hot surfaces to avoid burns; items like potholders or cookware can become ignitable. High-temperature settings may thicken and enhance the cooking of various foods. The cooking surface is designed to accommodate various cookware sizes.

For cleaning, refer to the designated instructions, as proper maintenance influences longevity. Users can access the release mechanism conveniently located at the front of the unit to remove items safely. 

For the clock functionality, pressing specific buttons will reset or adjust the time, including options for 12-hour or 24-hour formats. The system emits sound cues for various functions, including cooking or self-cleaning. 

The preheating option can be set using the corresponding controls, where the preset temperature is displayed. It's essential to monitor the preheating process, as it may automatically turn off once the desired temperature is reached. Users should also follow food temperature guidelines to ensure safety and proper cooking results.

Preheat items such as cookies and bread by utilizing the racks and cookware as indicated. Ensure there is at least a couple of inches of space around the cookware to prevent overheating or overbrowning. This is particularly important for cakes and dough-based items while using the convection function.

To begin cooking, follow these steps: Preheat to 350°F (176°C) by pressing the necessary buttons and selecting START. When active, the "TIMED" and "BAKE" indicators will show on the display and the oven will shut off automatically after a set time. Monitor the cooking process and avoid consuming food that's left out for more than an hour to prevent foodborne illnesses.

For optimal results, select the appropriate cooking function based on the type of food, as outlined in the instructions. For temperatures reaching 375°F (191°C), follow similar button presses to activate. Timing will be shown on the display, and you can cancel the operation at any point if needed.

It’s important to preheat to the recommended factory settings, which include options like 550°F (288°C) for broiling. If a grease fire occurs, do not throw water on it; use a fire extinguisher instead. Always monitor the temperature closely to prevent burning food and adjust based on the size and type of meat being cooked.

Utilizing the convection cooking mode enables even heat distribution, which can help reduce cooking time for thicker cuts of meat. Pay attention to the timing and temperature guidelines provided in the instructions to ensure safe and effective cooking.

If there are any adjustments to be made to the thermometer readings, you can offset temperatures by a range of +35°F or -35°F for accuracy. Always ensure the oven is set up correctly and monitor during cooking to prevent any mishaps.

Here's a paraphrased version:

Please note that this guide relates to the Sabbath and holidays. The BAKE and heating functions are the only cooking options available during these times. Initially, select the BAKE function and set the COOK TIME using the controls. The factory setting for COOK TIME is 12 hours. If any cooking features are activated during this period, their lights will illuminate. Once the light is turned ON and active, it will deactivate once the cooking process completes. Ensure that the oven door is closed to maintain proper operation. It's recommended to enable the START option to initiate cooking. To set the clock, press the necessary buttons accordingly.

If you want to cancel or adjust the COOK TIME, it is essential to follow specific steps to avoid risks, such as food poisoning due to improper cooking. If you need to restore factory settings, use the START button, which will cause a resetting sound and display "rSt." The light will indicate when the oven is ON or OFF, and cleaning tasks should be done carefully to avoid burns or damage.

For self-cleaning, remove any food and cookware from the oven as it cannot withstand high temperatures. A clean oven promotes efficiency; cleaning with non-abrasive cloths is recommended. Avoid using harsh cleaners that can damage the oven’s surfaces.

When it comes to decorative touches, clean painted areas gently without scratching the surfaces, using the correct materials recommended in the manual. After self-cleaning has finished, allow the oven to cool completely. If necessary, further cleaning can be done with specific products while adhering to health and safety guidelines.

In summary, follow the instructions clearly for operating, cleaning, and maintaining your oven, and always ensure safety to prevent burns or damage during use.

**Important Instructions:**

Ensure that the area around the appliance is clear to prevent obstruction or unexpected issues. Avoid scratching surfaces and causing excessive wear. To clean, use a cloth first, and then utilize appropriate cleaners designated for the appliance. Always prioritize safety with the lights, which are located within the cavity and shielded to protect against burns. It is essential to turn off the lights and carefully remove the shield when working with them.
