**Refrigerator FRF Instruction Manual**

**Instructions**  
This manual is designed for users interested in the proper operation and safety of the appliance. Please follow the specified guidelines to ensure safe usage. If the unit becomes heavy, avoid lifting without assistance. Read all instructions carefully before connecting the appliance to a power supply. It is essential to ensure that the refrigerator is installed by an authorized service technician to prevent damage or risks, particularly from heat sources or direct sunlight.

**Child Safety**  
Caution: Do not allow children to play near or with the appliance to prevent incidents of suffocation or injury. 

**Cooling and Maintenance**  
Allow the refrigerator to stabilize for several hours after turning it on before storing food inside. For optimal cooling performance, keep the thermostat settings appropriate; excessive heat or cold can affect food preservation. To maintain functionality, avoid placing hot items directly into the unit.

**Food Storage Guidelines**  
Food should be stored on shelves correctly, using protective covers for items like meat or liquids to prevent contamination. Items should never be stacked on top of each other in a way that restricts airflow. It’s advisable to keep perishable goods properly wrapped or sealed.

**Frost Management**  
Defrosting is necessary when excessive frost builds up. To defrost, switch off the unit and remove food items. Place towels or newspapers to absorb water during the melting process. Once defrosting is completed, clean the interior thoroughly before resetting the unit.

**Cleaning Protocol**  
Before cleaning, disconnect the power supply. Interior surfaces should be cleaned using soft cloths; avoid detergents or abrasive materials that could damage surfaces. Ensure that all drainage paths are clear to prevent overflow issues.

**Service Information**
