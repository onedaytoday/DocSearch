Here's a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

To switch the appliance on or off, press the designated button, which also controls the indicator light. If locked, it may be necessary to turn the unit off first. Should the light remain illuminated, it could indicate that it is already in a heating phase or the temperature is excessive. Ensure that you follow the below instructions carefully.

For optimal washing results, sort laundry into whites, colored fabrics, and synthetics. White items should be washed separately to maintain their brightness, while new colored garments should be washed initially to avoid color transfer. Stains such as grease should be treated promptly, possibly overnight, using appropriate cleaning agents.

When programming the machine, select the washing temperature based on the type of fabrics (e.g., 60°C for cotton, generally). For effective cleaning without prewashing, adhere to recommended amounts of detergent based on load size. 

Different washing programs are optimized for various fabric types, including settings for delicates and synthetics, as well as options for reduced spin cycles and stain removal. Be mindful of load capacity to avoid mechanical strain.

Cleaning and maintaining the appliance is critical. Always disconnect it from the power supply before carrying out maintenance. Remember to clean filters and seals to prevent blockages. In case of issues, refer to the troubleshooting guide for specific indicators and error tones to identify the appropriate course of action.

For emergency emptying, follow the outlined steps carefully to ensure safe operation, especially if the temperature is below freezing. Always secure components properly after maintenance to maintain optimal functionality.
