### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Motor Overheating
When diagnosing an overheating motor, start by checking the stationary phases. Ensure that DC voltage is flowing appropriately across all four phases. If readings exceed 150°C, the motor is likely activated under high-load conditions, possibly due to issues like sticking or high-friction components. Interventive actions should focus on verifying phase readings, which should not exceed 90°C during normal operation.

#### No Interlock
For motors connected to a 230V/50Hz input, confirm that the interlock is securely closed. If the interlock is not activated, operational commands may not be executed properly. If the interlock remains inactive, troubleshooting should focus on the interlock circuit and service power supply; ensuring proper closure during operation is critical.

#### Motor Short Circuit
Monitor the tachometer for any irregularities. A sustained high reading may indicate an internal short. If the motor operates normally upon restarting but fails subsequently, check for internal short circuits which may lead to reduced efficiency. Conduct further tests with the MCU Fault Logger for error codes indicating short circuit conditions.

#### Interlock Hardware
Verify the integrity of the interlock hardware at a 230V/50Hz input. An incorrectly configured interlock system can lead to operational lockout conditions. Investigate potential causes and ensure that all connections are secure.

#### Low DC Voltage
If the system provides a constant low DC voltage below operational thresholds, review input power supply configurations. The system may automatically shut down during low voltage conditions. Additional troubleshooting can be facilitated through the MCU Fault Logger for more detailed error notifications.

#### High DC Voltage
Should the input voltage surpass allowed limits, the system will also shut down. Analyze voltage levels and history using the Fault Logger to identify potential overvoltage conditions leading to system alerts.

#### Missing Parameter Set in MCU
Inspect the MCU settings to ensure parameters are correctly set. If the MCU does not maintain its configuration, power off the unit for at least a few seconds to reset the system and attempt reprogramming.

#### Motor Not Following Commands
If the motor deviates from expected rotational behavior, evaluate the time delay in response from the motor controller. Logging the error using the FC Error Logger can assist in diagnosing issues related to motor tracking.

#### DLCU Checksum from CPU
DLCU and CPU communication issues may arise due to interference. Ensure the system operates without external disruptions and verify hardware connectivity for optimal function.

#### Charge Circuit Issues
Monitor the charging circuit within the DLCU. If the CPU fails to receive proper signals, re-evaluate the interplay between the arming mechanisms and the CPU’s feedback loops.

#### Actuator Circuit Monitoring
Continuous monitoring of the actuator circuit through the DLCU is critical. Any interruptions in the hatch mechanism should be investigated promptly.

#### Various Thermal and Operational Errors
1. **Short Temperature Input Sensor**: Confirm if the thermistor is shorted.
2. **Fan Motor Overheating**: Check thermal protection limits.
3. **Drum Motor Overheating**: Inspect thermal protection systems.
4. **External Error Messages**: Monitor P13 errors and identify underlying causes.
5. **Thermostat Overheating**: Investigate any overheating thermostats.

Ensure equipment is regularly maintained, programming is correct, and any error codes are logged for future diagnostic clarity. For further details, consult Electrolux technical support at [www.electrolux.com/laundrysystems](http://www.electrolux.com/laundrysystems).
