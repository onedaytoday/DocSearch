### EUC Instruction Manual

**Power Supply**  
Disconnect the electricity by removing the power supply cable. Use three screws for fixing. Align parts as indicated in the reference guide. This instruction manual should remain with the appliance for future owners to understand its operation and features. 

**Important Safety Information**  
Adhere strictly to the safety guidelines provided. To reassemble, follow the steps: detach components from point (G), reassemble in accordance with arrow indicators, and secure cover (F) of part (D) using screws for part (E). Ensure the appliance is unplugged before performing any maintenance. Avoid sharp objects during defrosting. Manufacturers emphasize compliance with these instructions to prevent freezer burn or damage. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Ensure proper cleaning of cooling elements and avoid forced removal of frost. If the device is turned off for maintenance, allow sufficient time to defrost naturally. Regular checks are necessary for optimal functioning. 

**Child Safety**  
Keep appliances secured with locks or catches on doors to prevent access by children. If discarding an old appliance, render it unusable.

**Installation and Positioning**  
Position the appliance according to given temperature ratings (SN +10°C to +32°C, ST +18°C to +38°C) to ensure optimal operation. Maintain adequate space for airflow around the unit. 

**Thermostat Operation**  
Adjust the thermostat to the desired temperature, indicated by the status lights. If the environment is too cold or warm, the thermostat may need recalibrating. Ensure food is appropriately frozen or cooled based on specifications.

**Technical Specifications**  
Refer to dimensions and capacity ratings to understand performance capabilities. Use proper settings for various food types and ensure food safety by following defrosting guidelines.

Make sure to refer back to the manual when operating or troubleshooting the appliance.

### Warranty Conditions

This warranty guarantees that the appliance, under normal use, will operate free from defects in workmanship for a period of months from the date of purchase. If it fails due to a manufacturing fault, repairs will be provided at no charge. Some standard operational sounds, such as whirring or clicking, are expected during normal functioning.

The warranty excludes damages to the appliance resulting from improper use or external conditions.

The warranty does not cover items that become the property of the Company once serviced.

### Health and Safety Guidelines

Ensure that food is stored correctly and be mindful of cooling temperatures. The appliance should be kept at a temperature of 7°C or lower. When thawing frozen food, do so in a controlled manner, avoiding exposure to temperatures over 22°C for extended periods. Follow the guidelines for food packaging and take care to prevent contamination.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply before cleaning the interior. Avoid using detergents, abrasive cleaners, or highly perfumed products, as these can damage surfaces and leave odors. For defrosting, switch the thermostat to OFF and allow frost to melt safely.

For service inquiries or spare parts, reach out to Service Force. For further information, visit their website or contact the Customer Care Department directly.

### Troubleshooting

If the appliance is not working properly, check the thermostat settings and inspect for blockages. For continuous frost buildup or unusual sounds, consult the service team for a diagnosis. Regular maintenance is essential to ensure optimal performance and extend the lifespan of your appliance.

Within a few months of purchase, if issues arise due to workmanship or functionality, there is a guarantee that certain repairs may be provided at no cost. The appliance operates optimally within the specified electrical supply conditions, which includes parameters for food storage and equipment failure. Normal operational sounds may include whirring or clicking from the cooling mechanism, particularly when the thermostat activates. 

For best practices, ensure food is properly stored and avoid overcrowding, as this may hinder airflow and impact cooling efficiency. Fresh food should be stored in airtight containers to maintain quality, and it is recommended to organize items so that air can circulate effectively. Cooked food should cool before being stored. 

When installing the appliance, position it in a well-ventilated area where ambient temperatures are within the specified range, ideally from +10°C to +32°C. Ensure that there is adequate clearance around the appliance for proper air circulation.

If the appliance is being discarded, it is crucial to disable any door locks or catches to prevent accidental entrapment, especially for children. For installation and operational instructions, please refer to the manufacturer's manual, including safety guidelines for ensuring proper earth grounding. 

Technical specifications include voltage requirements, energy absorption rates, and storage capacities, all indicating the appliance’s efficient performance standards. Regular maintenance and adherence to operational guidelines will prolong the life of the appliance and its effectiveness in preserving food quality.

Disconnect the appliance from its power source before proceeding. Ensure that you retain all instructions for future reference, as they provide vital safety and operational information. Carefully reassemble the cover, ensuring that all components and screws are securely fastened. Avoid using sharp instruments to remove frost. When defrosting, follow the manufacturer's guidelines to prevent frost-freezer burns. 

Make sure the appliance is positioned according to specified guidelines to ensure adequate airflow and prevent overheating. Keep it away from direct sunlight and heating sources. Repairs should only be conducted by authorized personnel, especially if the device is malfunctioning. Instruct children not to play with the appliance to ensure safety. 

Always follow the provided safety information and operational instructions to maintain efficiency and prevent damage.
