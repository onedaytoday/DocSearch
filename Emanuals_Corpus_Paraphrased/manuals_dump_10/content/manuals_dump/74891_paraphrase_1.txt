### Drying and Cleaning Instructions

Use the appropriate drying settings based on fabric thickness: select **EXTRA COTTON** for thick items or **DAMP EXTRA SYNTHETICS** for thinner fabrics. For delicate items like silk and wool, utilize the **AUTO SILK**, **AUTO SPECIAL WOOL**, and **DELICATE** options, ensuring that the drying process minimizes creasing. 

When choosing a drying function, you can select from **DRYNESS**, **DELICATE**, **BUZZER**, and **TIME** settings. The **DRYNESS** setting can be adjusted from **MIN** to **MAX** depending on fabric type. A flashing **AUTO** indicates another function selection needs confirmation, while altered temperatures can be rectified by re-selecting the appropriate **DRYNESS** function.

For delicate fabrics, you should use the **DELICATE** setting, which operates at lower heat. The **BUZZER** function will signal the end of the drying cycle with an audible alert. 

To initiate the drying process, press the **START/PAUSE** button. Once the cycle begins, the **DRYING** and **COOLING** indicators will activate. The machine will automatically adjust settings during operation, especially for delicate fabrics, to prevent damage or burns. Ensure the door is securely locked during operation. 

After drying, the **CREASE GUARD** function will help minimize wrinkles. If any issues occur, refer to the troubleshooting section to resolve malfunctions. For safety, regularly clean the device components as outlined in the cleaning section.
