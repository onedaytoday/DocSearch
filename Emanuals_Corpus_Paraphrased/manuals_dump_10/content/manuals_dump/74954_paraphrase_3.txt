**Thermaline Cooking Top**

The 900 Thermaline is designed for heavy-duty in-flight cooking and offers flexibility as a stand-alone unit or as part of a modular cooking island. This top can be installed at various heights—either mounted directly or on a plinth—facilitating easy access and operation from either side. The cooking intensity can be adjusted, providing versatility for different culinary tasks.

It features robust construction, including a thick heat-retaining plate made of fire clay, certified by international standards for safety and performance, and capable of reaching temperatures up to 350°C. The unit includes GN 2/1 shelf compatibility, thermostatic controls for precise heating, roasting capabilities, and user-friendly maintenance features.

The front is designed for straightforward cleaning with stainless steel (AISI) finishes, while the IP X5 rating ensures protection against water ingress during cleaning.
