Here's a natural, technical paraphrase of your text:

**Cooking Method and Safety Instructions**  
This appliance is designed to cook items using back heat, which provides high-temperature searing. Once the cooking temperature is achieved, it effectively turns the food. The appliance is installed facing the back and should be directly connected to a properly grounded three-prong outlet to ensure safety. 

**Important Note:** This device has a grounding mechanism to prevent electric shock. Do not attempt to use it without proper grounding. Ensure the meat is placed with the right side up, allowing for even heat distribution during cooking. 

To begin, turn the switch to the "On" position, and rotate it counterclockwise to the "HIGH" setting. You will hear a sound signaling that the unit is operational. If the light does not activate within a few seconds, switch it off and try again. For proper functioning, hold down the match while rotating to "HIGH."

**Cleaning and Maintenance Guidelines**  
After cooking, allow the grates to cool before cleaning. It's recommended to clean the cooking surface immediately after use to prevent buildup of grease and food residue. Cleaning should be conducted at least once a month to avoid any potential hazards.

**Troubleshooting Guide**  
Inspect the appliance regularly for proper functionality. If you notice uneven heating or issues with the indicator light, check the battery and replace it if necessary. For those using L.P. gas, ensure the gas supply is clear and functioning correctly.

**Warranty Information**  
This appliance comes with a limited lifetime warranty covering defects in material and workmanship. The warranty does not cover damage from misuse, hostile alterations, or cosmetic issues like scratches. Please refer to the user manual for details and contact customer service if needed for further assistance.
