**Drying Instructions**

1. **Operation**: Press the "Start" button to begin the cycle and select "Dry" to initiate drying. 
2. **Warning**: Use only for drying synthetic and cotton textiles. Items should be classified as either cotton, synthetic, or wool. The drying process includes an emptying phase; ensure the filter is clear before proceeding, as a blocked filter may result in creasing of the garments.
3. **Cycle Features**: The drying stages include warning signals for changes in process—indicated by flashing lights—and the machine will lock during operation. If items are moved to different phases or require adjustments, turn off the unit before making changes.
4. **Loading Guidelines**: Laundry should be sorted into whites, colors, and synthetics prior to washing. Whites should be washed first, while colored items must be treated to avoid color transfer.
5. **Stains Removal**: For stubborn stains, use appropriate treatments, such as soaking in detergent or using bleach where applicable.
6. **Detergents and Additives**: Choose detergents suitable for the fabric type; high-efficiency options work best at 60°C. Refer to local water hardness levels to select the correct wash program.
7. **Drying Cycle Preparation**: Ensure the drying hose is properly connected and avoid loading unsuitable fabrics like heavy synthetics or items with embellishments, as these can cause fires or other hazards.
8. **Cycle Duration and Types**: The duration of your drying cycle will depend on the fabric type being processed. For additional drying, consider using timed cycles suitable for specific textiles.
9. **Maintenance**: Regularly clean the filters and exterior surfaces of the machine to maintain optimal performance, following specific cleaning and descaling protocols provided in the user manual.
10. **Safety Precautions**: Ensure the machine is disconnected during maintenance and avoid using abrasive cleaning agents.

For efficient fabric care, observe recommended max load guidelines and sort laundry effectively.
