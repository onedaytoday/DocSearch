**Chiller Overview**

The chiller efficiently reduces the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly minimizing bacterial levels within this temperature range and further cooling it to -18°C within four hours. This chilling and freezing process enhances food shelf life without compromising quality. 

**Operational Modes**
The system offers various operating modes, including Soft Chilling at 2°C and standard chilling at 20°C. The ARTE feature activates cooling to +3°C continuously upon food insertion, adhering to NF and UK regulations. It also incorporates built-in UV technology (or available as an accessory) for defrosting, alongside a countdown display that offers service information. Each operating mode—P1 and P2—records relevant data for HACCP compliance, even in the event of an abnormal termination.

**Performance and Construction**
Chilling performance varies based on food type and complies with NF standards. The unit’s construction features an AISI stainless steel exterior with high-density polyurethane insulation, ensuring efficient thermal performance. The rounded corners enhance safety, while the IP20 rating provides adequate protection.
