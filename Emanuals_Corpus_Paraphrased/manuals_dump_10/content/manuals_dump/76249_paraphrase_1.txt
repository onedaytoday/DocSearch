**Instructions for Operation:**
To begin, press the START/PAUSE button. If the DOOR indicator flashes when START/PAUSE is activated, it signifies that the door is not securely closed. The E40 error code will also flash, indicating that the MAIN WASH is not ready. Ensure the door is properly closed and press the START/PAUSE button again. The machine will count down the hours and display the selected wash cycle. You can use the START/PAUSE button or the DELAY TIMER repeatedly without adjusting the set parameters to view the countdown.

For adjustments or to cancel a wash, press the START/PAUSE button and hold it to turn the machine OFF. If PUMP OUT is selected, the machine will proceed to drain. To modify selected wash options like QUICK WASH or STAIN, press START/PAUSE again after making your selection. After completion, if RINSE HOLD is activated, the START/PAUSE light will blink.

**End of Cycle:**
Once the cycle concludes, the machine will indicate the END. If RINSE HOLD was selected, the START/PAUSE light may continue blinking to remind you to finalize the process. You can choose options for PUMP OUT or SPIN. At this point, the DOOR light will illuminate when it's safe to open. Switch the machine OFF after the cycle completes.
