### Instruction Manual for Household Appliances

Ensure the appliance is disconnected from the electrical supply before use. Please note, this manual contains essential information on operating and maintaining the appliance, which should be retained for future reference or passed on to a new owner. It is crucial to read and understand all safety information outlined in sections (A) and (B).

To perform certain functions, such as cleaning or servicing, you must turn off the appliance. For defrosting, avoid using sharp objects. Cleaning can be done without forcibly removing items that may cause frost or freezer burns.

Repairs should only be performed by authorized Service Force personnel, especially in cases of serious malfunction. Children should be kept away from the appliance to prevent accidents related to frost or burns. 

This appliance must be earthed for safety. Follow the provided technical specifications for proper positioning and ensure clear airflow around it. The appliance operates best in environments where temperatures range from 10°C (50°F) to 32°C (90°F). 

Take caution not to block or restrict airflow, particularly around the back and top of the appliance. If disposing of an old model, ensure it is rendered unusable to prevent hazards for young children. The appliance must be placed in an environment free from excessive sunlight and not exposed to extreme temperatures.

For technical configurations, follow the color-coded wiring guide provided to avoid electrical hazards. Ensure that safety standards are met by adhering to the EEC directives regarding installation.

### Operating Instructions

Before switching on the appliance, verify that the voltage and frequency match the specified values. When adjusting the thermostat, allow sufficient time for temperature stabilization. It may take several hours for food items to reach the optimal temperature after initial startup.

Food should be stored properly, ideally using airtight containers. Meat should be thoroughly cleaned and stored correctly. Fresh food should be organized for efficient cooling. 

### Warranty and Guarantee Conditions

The warranty covers defects in materials or workmanship for a specified number of months from the date of purchase, assuming proper usage as per guidelines. If problems arise, return the appliance to the point of purchase or contact Service Force for assistance. 

For any repairs or servicing, only authorized personnel should be engaged. Products sold outside the Community (EC) have different warranty conditions, so check for local regulations. 

In cases of thawing food, adhere to safe practices to prevent spoilage. Use microwave or direct cooking methods for thawing items. If food has been previously frozen, ensure it is cooked properly afterward.

### General Cautions

Normal operating sounds may include blowing, cooling, or a soft whirring. These are typical and indicate proper function. Avoid opening the door frequently, as this may disrupt internal temperature stability.

Always consult the manual for further guidance on food storage, safety precautions, and appliance operation.
