**PM Instructions Overview**

Thank you for selecting your cleaner. These instructions encompass essential information, including cleaning guidelines, troubleshooting tips, and other pertinent details related to the model.

**Safety Precautions and Accessories**

The combination hose must be used exclusively with the proper insulation and must be earthed. Any failure to comply may void the warranty. It’s important that individuals with reduced physical capabilities or inadequate knowledge should seek proper instruction before operation, especially around children. Ensure that the cleaning areas are clear of hazards such as lit cigarette butts or ashes. Only authorized service personnel should perform maintenance covered under the warranty.

**Operational Guidelines**

Before commencing, ensure all parts, such as the front cover and hose, are secure and click into place properly. To activate or deactivate the cleaner, use the foot pedal. When cleaning, maintain suction through the designated hose, ensuring ease of use and efficiency.

**Achieving Optimal Cleaning Results**

For optimal performance, alternate between carpet and hard surface settings as needed. Utilize lightweight accessories designed for crevices and corners, ensuring the cleaner operates effectively on all surfaces. Always switch off the device before making adjustments.

**Dust Bag Replacement**

Once the dust bag indicator shows red, it’s time for a replacement. Press the catches to detach the hose and the front cover. Remove the full dust bag and insert a new one. Ensure the attachment is secure before replacing the covers.

**Cleaning the Hose and Nozzle**

If the hose or nozzle becomes obstructed, allow it to cool and inspect for blockages. Maintain the hose’s suction by regularly checking for clogs. Clear any debris by detaching the hose and cleaning it thoroughly.

**Troubleshooting and Consumer Guidance**

If you're experiencing issues, check that the cleaner is properly connected and that the power supply is functioning. For persistent problems, contact authorized service personnel. Additional consumer information is available at [www.electrolux.com](http://www.electrolux.com).
