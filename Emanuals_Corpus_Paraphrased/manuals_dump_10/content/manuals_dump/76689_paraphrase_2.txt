It is important to note that the Black Top is not included, and no warranty applies to that aspect. Unauthorized modifications or installations will void any warranty associated with the product.

Ensure that the projector is properly grounded to avoid risks of electrical shock or fire. Use only the recommended power supply, as excessive load can cause overheating.

Optional L-Brackets may be used for additional support.
