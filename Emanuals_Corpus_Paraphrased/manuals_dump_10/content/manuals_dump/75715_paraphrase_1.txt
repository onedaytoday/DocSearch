Thawing plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality of fresh products, enabling them to be cooked effectively. The process allows for high uniformity in thawed items, thanks to advanced thawing technology. The materials used in construction, such as A304 stainless steel, ensure durability and facilitate cleaning, while thick insulation enhances operational efficiency.

The thawing cabinet features preset phases for thawing, which contribute to safety by minimizing bacterial growth. It operates seamlessly, allowing for easy cleaning without compromising performance. The technical specifications include built-in cooling, thermostats, and thermometers, with precise dimensions tailored for GN containers and pastry trays (400x600 mm). 

Moreover, the cabinet is designed with environmental considerations in mind, utilizing insulation that is free from CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs, in accordance with ISO9001 and ISO14001 standards. Overall, models like TC651DEX, TC651DEX2, and EF0020 are built for efficient, safe thawing while remaining easy to service.
