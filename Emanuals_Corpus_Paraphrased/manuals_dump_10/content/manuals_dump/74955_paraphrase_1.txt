The GN steamer combines traditional cooking methods with advanced research and professional creativity, offering a high-performance cooking and chilling solution designed specifically for caterers. Its convection feature allows meat to be cooked without drying out, and its half-power function ensures efficient energy use. Steam cooking enhances the organoleptic qualities of food while reducing cooking times and improving heating efficiency. 

This system also allows for precise temperature control, ensuring optimal cooking outcomes based on the food type. For instance, it integrates a humidity control feature for different cooking phases, allowing for flexible cooking strategies. The Air-o-clean function facilitates easy cleaning, incorporating a built-in cooling system that streamlines maintenance compared to previous models, eliminating the need for manual shower cleaning.

The unit is compliant with HACCP protocols, facilitating the recording of cooking processes manually or via a personal computer.
