**Troubleshooting Refrigeration Issues**

1. **Frequent Frost Build-Up**: Ensure that the FROSTMATIC and COOLMATIC functions are appropriately set. Excessive frost can occur if water collects on the plate or if the products are improperly positioned, causing airflow obstruction. 

2. **Frost Accumulation**: If frost develops, check that the outlet is not blocked and that the defrosting process is functioning correctly. Clean any obstructions to facilitate proper water drainage and ensure products are not packed too closely together.

3. **Temperature Settings**: Adjust the temperature settings if they are too high. Use the FROSTMATIC function for freezing items and COOLMATIC for chilling items.

4. **Installation Tips**: For optimal performance, position the appliance in a location with a stable temperature range specified on the rating plate. Avoid placing the unit near heat sources such as boilers and direct sunlight.

5. **Electrical Connections**: Ensure proper grounding of the unit. Connect the colored wires according to the following: 
   - Yellow: Earth
   - Brown: Live (L)
   - Blue: Neutral (N)
   This setup prevents electrical hazards.

6. **Shelf Configuration**: The shelves can be adjusted easily. Follow the arrows on the shelf for direction when inserting or removing. 

7. **Service Instructions**: If you encounter issues with operations or service functions, consult the Service Force for assistance or check the reversibility of installation details.

8. **Disposal and Recycling**: This appliance should be recycled according to local regulations. For information about recycling, visit the manufacturer's website or contact your retailer.
