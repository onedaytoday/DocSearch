### Fresh Food Ideas and Maintenance

To optimize the performance of your refrigerator's fresh food compartment, avoid overcrowding the shelves as this can hinder airflow and cooling efficiency. Ensure that meats and other perishables are stored securely, preventing cross-contamination and maintaining proper temperatures. Regular cleaning is essential; utilize suitable cleaning agents and tools, ensuring they are safe for use on appliance surfaces to avoid damage.

When adjusting temperature controls, refrain from overloading the unit, as this can impede its ability to maintain the desired temperature. During short vacations or extended periods where the refrigerator will not be in use (typically longer than three months), clean the appliance thoroughly. Ensure it is unplugged, and allow it to dry completely.

### Cleaning Instructions

Turn off the IQ Touch™ and any LED lights before cleaning. Use a damp cloth with mild soap to wipe down surfaces. Avoid harsh cleaners or scrubbing pads, as they can scratch and damage the appliance's finish. Make sure to follow any specific cleaning instructions provided for your model.

### Troubleshooting Guide

Common appliance issues, including improper cooling or strange sounds, can often be attributed to improper usage or environmental factors. Ensure the appliance is level and that the door seals are in good condition. If unfamiliar error codes appear on the display, consult the user manual for assistance.

If the appliance fails to run, check that it is properly plugged in and that circuit breakers have not been tripped. If these issues persist, professional service may be required. Always follow recommended troubleshooting steps before seeking technician support.
