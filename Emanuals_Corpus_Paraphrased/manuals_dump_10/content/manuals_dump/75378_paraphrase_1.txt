**Wall and Information Cleaning: Important Warranty Instructions**

Please adhere to the following instructions carefully to ensure safety and compliance. These guidelines address potential hazards, including serious injury or property damage. It is crucial to follow them as detailed. Ensure that the installation is carried out by a qualified technician, in accordance with the National ANSI Z223.1/NFPA standards.

**Safety Recommendations**:
1. **Cooling Period**: Allow the oven to cool for at least 0°C/32°F before touching. Never touch the interior burner or surfaces immediately after use as they may cause burns.
2. **Child Safety**: Keep children away from the oven. They should not reach or interact with flammable items, such as plastic, cloth towels, and cookbooks, which can ignite.
3. **Fire Safety**: For grease or other fires, use a multi-purpose or foam fire extinguisher. Avoid using water, as it can spread the flames.

**Food Safety**:
- **Avoid Unopened Containers**: Do not heat sealed food containers, as the pressure buildup may cause rupture.
- **Thermostat Functionality**: Ignite the oven as instructed and turn off when not in use.

**Oven Cleaning**:
- Always maintain a clean oven to prevent grease build-up, which can ignite. Use self-cleaning mode as needed and ensure it is free from debris and residue after use.

**Grounding Safety**:
- Ensure the oven is properly grounded to prevent electrical shock. Do not alter the grounding prong, and avoid using two-prong adapters or extension cords.

**Operating Procedures**:
1. **Oven Rack Configuration**: Always arrange oven racks when cool for optimal cooking efficiency.
2. **Avoid Overcrowding**: Prevent overcrowding in the oven to ensure even cooking temperatures and avoid warping.

**Cleaning Methods**:
- Use appropriate cleaning materials to maintain the exterior and interior of the oven. Avoid scratching surfaces and using harsh chemicals that may damage the oven's finish.

**Final Notes**:
- Follow all guidelines closely to ensure the proper usage and maintenance of your oven, avoiding serious risks such as fire or electric shock.

**Cleaning Instructions for Self-Cleaning Appliances**

To maintain the cleanliness of smooth surfaces, remove spills and heavy soiling immediately. Regular cleanings will lessen the need for intensive cleanings in the future. Before starting the cleaning process, ensure that the appliance has cooled down and wear protective gear for manual cleaning. Avoid using cleaners with high alkalinity (such as oven cleaners) during the self-cleaning process, as they may interfere with cleaning efficacy.

It's advisable to allow the appliance to sit closed for several hours or overnight to prepare for cleaning. Use a damp cloth for wiping surfaces. Avoid scouring pads or abrasive cleaners unless specifically instructed. Steer clear of combining different cleaning products, and clean surfaces methodically from back to front.

**Warnings:**
- Do not allow water to enter the control panel or heat source.
- Prevent food particles from coming in contact with heating elements to avoid improper heating.
- Follow the self-cleaning instructions to ensure safety and effectiveness.

**Self-Cleaning Procedures:**
The self-cleaning feature utilizes high temperatures to effectively clean cooking residues. During this process, the appliance may produce sounds as contaminants are incinerated. After a cycle, wipe any remaining ash with a cloth.

**Precautions:**
- Ensure that heavy cookware is suitable for self-cleaning cycles.
- Allow the interior to cool before handling. 
- Items such as plasticware, cookbooks, and towels should be removed prior to cleaning to prevent damage.

**Troubleshooting:**
If the self-cleaning cycle fails or is interrupted, refer to the user manual's section on stopping the self-cleaning process.  

**Warranty Information:**
Your appliance is covered by a full one-year warranty, which includes parts and labor. It applies to standard household use and excludes damages from improper service or external factors. 

For any service requirements, consult with authorized service providers, and keep in mind that consumers are responsible for any costs associated with service calls. Maintain all warranty documentation in case repairs are needed.
