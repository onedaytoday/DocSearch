**Important Safety Information**

This section addresses vital safety guidelines, operating instructions, maintenance details, troubleshooting, warranty/customer service information, installation directions, and electrical connections relevant to the cooker hood.

**Important Safety Information**

For safety, please adhere to these guidelines. If you have questions or concerns about the appliance, refer to the customer information section. Compliance with applicable regulations (BS.6172, BS.5440, BS.6891, and BS.5482) and building codes is essential. Ensure the cooker hood maintains the recommended clearance height to prevent overheating. If it becomes excessively hot, turn off the unit and allow it to cool. This appliance is designed for safe operation, and only qualified personnel should conduct repairs to avoid serious issues.

**Your Appliance and Operating Instructions**

The cooker hood features three switches at the front: L (light ON/OFF), M (motor ON/OFF), and V (normal operation). Use these to control the light and suction power. Proper maintenance includes regular cleaning of the grease filters; these can be washed by hand or in a dishwasher.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

Always turn off the appliance and disconnect it from the electrical supply before cleaning. Regularly check and replace the charcoal filter approximately every three months or more frequently based on usage. To replace the charcoal filter, remove the grease filter and rotate the charcoal filter counterclockwise to detach. Reinstall in reverse order.

Should the light fail, replace it with a 40W clear bulb with an E14 screw fitting.

**Troubleshooting**

If the appliance malfunctions, check the following: Ensure it is powered on, the grease filter is clean, and the charcoal filter is effective. If issues persist, contact customer service.

**Guarantee/Customer Service**

The appliance is under warranty for a specified period from the date of purchase. This includes repair or replacement at no charge for defects in workmanship provided the appliance was used according to the instructions. Unauthorized repairs may void the warranty. For service or product inquiries, contact Service Force.

**Installation Instructions**

Check the following dimensions before installation: chimney height (upper and lower sections), canopy width, and depth. The electrical specifications are: voltage of 230V, power consumption of 230W (fan motor: 150W, light bulb: 80W). Suitable installations include electric hobs (up to 7kW) and gas hobs (up to 10kW).

To ensure compliance with health and safety regulations, recycle appropriately. The appliance adheres to EEC compatibility and directives.

**Electrical Connections**

Ensure proper installation compliance with I.E.E. regulations. The appliance should be connected to the mains supply by a qualified electrician. Use a correctly rated fuse, and ensure grounding is not required due to the double insulation design.

**Installing the Cooker Hood**

During installation, ensure it is set up according to local regulations to avoid complications. When unpacking, orient the unit with arrows pointing upwards.

**Clearance Requirements**

Maintain the specified clearance below the hood when installing it above your cooking appliances. Follow the provided clearance instructions for built-in or integrated models.

### INSTALLATION OF THE COOKER HOOD

**Wall Mounting**  
The cooker hood should be installed on the wall at an appropriate height as specified, ensuring it is positioned correctly relative to the stovetop. Refer to the dimensions provided for accurate placement. Adjustments can be made using the notched guidelines supplied, ensuring a secure fit with the provided screws.

**Optional Splashback**  
To enhance the installation, an optional splashback may be added. It should be positioned at both the top and base, with careful alignment to ensure compatibility with the cooker hood. Installation should ideally be carried out by an experienced individual. Attach the splashback to the wall and base using the screws included.

**Ducted Extraction**  
For optimal performance, employ a ducted system that conforms to British standards (e.g., DIN 4102-B1). Connect ducting to the top of the cooker hood as illustrated, ensuring the run is as short as possible to maximize efficiency while minimizing airflow restrictions. If using a gas appliance, ensure it is properly sealed and that the ducting style is appropriate for your setup.

When integrating with a charcoal filter, ensure proper installation of the filter to facilitate effective air purification. Adjust the chimney section as necessary for a snug fit, securing with the corresponding screws. Ensure all outlets are correctly aligned and connected.
