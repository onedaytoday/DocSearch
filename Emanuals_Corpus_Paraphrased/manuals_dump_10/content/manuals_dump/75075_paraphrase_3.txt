To operate the microwave fully, adhere to the instructions below. To set the clock, press "CLEAR" and then "CLOCK," and select the desired hour (A.M. or P.M.). If an error appears, press "STOP/CLEAR" and try again. Should the power supply be interrupted, reset the clock using the same steps.

For cooking, utilize the "START" button along with functions like "popcorn," "fresh," and "reheat." To pause cooking, press "STOP/CLEAR." For timed operations, select the desired cooking time and press "START." When cooking specific foods, refer to the cookbook or defrost chart for recommendations. If adjustments are necessary, you can input values manually.

Ensure food is arranged appropriately for even cooking. While defrosting, keep a close check on the food, especially for ground meats and seafood, ensuring it is covered during the process. The desired internal temperature should be at least 160°F. Always verify that food items don’t become overcooked.

For reheating, choose your food from the chart provided and follow recommended procedures. Certain items may require covering with a towel to maintain moisture. For optimal results, avoid overcrowding within the microwave.

The Child Lock feature can be activated to prevent unintended use. To deactivate or lock it, press "START." For those who prefer adjustments to units or language, options are available in English or Spanish and in customary measurements.

Press "START" for the cooking function and select from the options as needed. If you need to stop cooking abruptly, you can press "STOP/CLEAR" or use the timer feature to pause and resume effectively.

**Operation Instructions:**

To operate the microwave, use the Touch On/Off feature. To reset, press STOP/CLEAR once. Note that the procedure demonstration progresses through three stages: START, followed by the DEMO ON indicator, and concludes with a timer displaying seconds. To end the demonstration, press STOP/CLEAR. An interactive HELP indicator will illuminate to provide hints for user assistance during operations.

**Cleaning Guidelines:**

For cleaning, use a soft cloth with a mild household cleaner. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can damage the surface. Do not spray oven cleaners directly onto any microwave parts. Regular cleaning ensures optimal performance and prevents food splatter from catching fire. Always allow food to cool before cleaning, and remove the turntable and racks for easy washing—these are dishwasher safe unless otherwise specified.

**Service Information:**

For any issues, ensure the microwave is securely connected to a power source. If any problems arise, do not attempt repairs yourself—contact an authorized Electrolux service technician.
