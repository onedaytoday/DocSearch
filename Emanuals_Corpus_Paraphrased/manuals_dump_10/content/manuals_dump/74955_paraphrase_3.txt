The unit also integrates Air-o-clean functionality for streamlined cleaning processes, utilizing built-in cooling systems that are more effective than previous models.

Moreover, the steamers comply with HACCP standards, allowing for cooking data to be recorded and monitored via PC or optional interfaces. Technical specifications include support for LPG, with versatile cooking chamber sizes able to accommodate convection and steaming functions that operate at two speeds.

Included accessories such as trays, racks, and wheels facilitate efficient cooking and storage. Additional options include water softening systems, exhaust hoods, fat filters, and customized trolleys for enhanced operational efficiency. Overall, the GN steamer series is designed for professional kitchens seeking to maximize performance and simplify workflows.
