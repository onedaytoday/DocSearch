**Safety Warning!** Non-stop drying for synthetics is not recommended.

**Drying Instructions and Sorting**

Carefully adhere to drying and sorting instructions. Sort laundry into categories: whites, colors, synthetics, typical whites, towels, tablecloths, standard shirts, and lightweight synthetic items. Avoid washing whites and colors together. Wash whites first to maintain brightness, and treat new colored items before washing. Light-colored clothing may attract dye transfers during drying.

**Loading Requirements**

Ensure items are not packed too tightly. For synthetics, load them loosely to facilitate dryer efficiency. Common items include bathrobes, towels, and blouses. For stubborn stains, freshen items overnight, pre-soak or treat them as needed with a cloth and stain removal solutions before washing.

**Cleaning Instructions**

Regular maintenance is crucial for optimal dryer performance. Disconnect from the power supply before cleaning. Follow the manufacturer's directions for maintaining the unit. Clean lint and filter surfaces regularly to prevent buildup. 

In cases of issues, such as malfunction alerts (E10, E20, E40), check for properly closed components and any clogs. Should the error persist, refer to service guidelines for resolution.

**Technical Specifications**

Refer to the manufacturer's rating plate for detailed specifications regarding water supply, height, and operational modes, such as synthetics, wool, and hand wash cycles. Ensure all hoses are correctly positioned and secure to avoid any blockages or operational issues.
