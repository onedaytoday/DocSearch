#### Control Panel Indicator Lights
These lights indicate whether the oven is on. They will illuminate when the temperature is reached and turn off once the cooking process concludes. Follow the instructions carefully to avoid any errors during operation.

#### Grill and Oven Accessories
Ensure you use the recommended accessories and, if necessary, consult Service Force for assistance.

### Use of the Dual Grill
**Caution:** Accessible parts may become hot during grilling; keep children away. The dual grill can be used to cook food entirely or partially.

#### Selecting the Dual Grill
To select only the upper section, turn the function to the right to set the temperature to either 110°C or 150°C. 

**Important Note:** The grill door must remain open while grilling. During this time, the cooling fan will appear slightly brighter.

### Grill Pan and Handle
Ensure the grill pan and handle are correctly positioned for safety and efficiency. The pan should be centered beneath the heating elements.

#### Tips for Grilling
For optimal results, food should be evenly spaced to allow consistent cooking. Preheating may enhance performance and avoid uneven cooking.

### Grilling Chart
A chart provides recommended grilling times for various foods, grouped by shelf position. 

### Use of the Top Oven
The top oven is designed for variable cooking, such as baking cakes or roasting meat. 

#### Selecting the Top Oven
Adjust the temperature by turning the function dial. 

**Note:** The internal light confirms when the desired temperature is reached.

### Fitting Top Oven Shelves
Shelves should be adjusted so they are straight and securely positioned towards the back of the oven.

#### Cooking Tips
Maintain an adequate space between the food and the oven top for best results, especially for baked goods.

### Main Fan Oven
The fan oven provides even heating by circulating air around the food.

#### Preheating
It’s typically recommended to preheat the oven; this is crucial for achieving optimal results when baking.

### Cooking Temperatures
Follow the given temperature guidelines closely, adjusting as needed depending on the dish.

### Defrost Function
The defrost function is designed to evenly thaw foods, like cakes or cheesecakes, without cooking them.

#### Selecting Defrost
Activate the defrost mode as needed. Ensure all meat joints are thoroughly thawed before cooking, and always cook immediately after defrosting to minimize bacteria growth.

### Conventional Oven
This oven function allows for top and bottom heat usage, ideal for dishes like gratins that benefit from a top-down cooking method.

#### Selecting the Conventional Oven
Adjust the oven function to activate. The internal light will indicate when the oven has reached the set temperature.

### Zoned Oven
The zoned oven maintains a temperature differential of up to 30°C between the top and bottom, ideal for layered dishes.

#### Selecting the Zoned Oven
Turn the oven setting to activate this feature. Ensure that the internal light is functioning as a temperature indicator.

### Cooking Chart
A reference chart provides guidance on cooking temperatures and shelf placement for optimal results. Adjust temperatures and settings based on your specific dish requirements.

### Thermal Grilling Overview

**Uses of Thermal Grilling**
Thermal grilling involves cooking food using a combination of heat from both above and below the food. This method reduces cooking time and allows for even heating while the food is enclosed. Common dishes, such as shepherd's pie, benefit from this technique as it both cooks and browns them effectively.

**Selecting Thermal Grilling**
To engage the thermal grilling function, set the oven to a temperature between 140°C and 220°C. Note that this method works best with the door closed to maintain optimal cooking conditions.

**Important Considerations**
Once the selected temperature is reached, the oven will indicate this by switching on and off. An internal light signifies that the cooking process is active. Allow the cooling fan to operate after turning off the oven until it has completely cooled down.

**Cooking Tips**
When preparing food, use minimal oil and select a higher shelf position for even cooking. Adjust the cooking time based on the thickness of the food and ensure to check periodically. Recommended thermal grilling temperatures for various foods typically range from 140°C to 220°C.

**Cooking Times Table**
- **Food Item**: e.g., Rashers, Chops, Whole Trout, etc.
- **Shelf Position**: Counted from the bottom.
- **Temperature (°C)**: Specific temp for optimal cooking.
- **Time**: Approximate time needed for cooking.

### Oven Clean Feature

**Usage of the Oven Clean Feature**
The oven features a Stayclean coating, which facilitates the cleaning process by efficiently removing food splatters during use. To activate, set the oven temperature to 220°C.

**Operating Instructions**
The cleaning cycle will begin once the designated temperature is achieved. The internal light operates in conjunction with the cleaning function. Regular maintenance with non-abrasive cleaners is recommended to preserve the Stayclean finish.

**Cleaning Tips**
Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials for cleaning, as they can damage the oven's surface. If heavy soiling occurs, consult the cleaning guidelines for effective cleaning methods.

### Electronic Timer Instructions

**Setting and Using the Timer**

### Automatic Control Settings

To utilize automatic cooking functions, ensure all parameters are correctly set for the food type. The timer can be configured to switch the oven on and off according to the desired cooking duration. 

### Food Preparation Tips

When purchasing and preparing food, follow guidelines to minimize bacterial contamination: 
- Always select fresh products.
- Store foods properly and minimize exposure to temperatures above 25°C.
- Ensure meat is thoroughly defrosted and use a meat thermometer to confirm internal temperatures.

### Care and Cleaning Guidelines

**Prior to Cleaning**
Always allow the oven to cool down and the cooling fan to operate before disconnecting from the electricity supply.

**General Cleaning Tips**
- Avoid abrasive materials for cleaning the exterior and controls.
- Do not attempt to remove control knobs as it may lead to damage.
- The Stayclean surfaces require manual cleaning and should not be treated with harsh chemicals.

**Cleaning Glass and Shelves**
- Use suitable cleaning agents for the door glass and ensure proper techniques for removing and replacing components.

For further assistance, please refer to specific cleaning sections or consult professional service if needed.

### Care for Stayclean Surfaces

Stayclean surfaces are designed to handle food splatters, especially when operating at temperatures around 220°C. To maintain optimal performance from the Stayclean finish, it is recommended to use the Clean function. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or polishes, as these can damage the Stayclean surface. Regularly cooking at higher temperatures increases the likelihood of splashes, particularly when roasting meat. It's advisable to brush off splatters during cooking to prevent buildup, which could lead to over-browning. Ensure that any coverings are removed as needed for even cooking.

### Replacing an Oven Light Bulb

When replacing a light bulb, use a 300°C type. First, disconnect the appliance from the power supply for safety. Remove any shelves for easier access to the light assembly. A screwdriver may be needed to detach the cover, which can be unscrewed counterclockwise. Replace the bulb and secure the cover by turning it clockwise, ensuring all components are correctly reassembled. Reconnect the electricity supply and reset the clock as necessary.

### Troubleshooting Issues

If you encounter problems, follow these guidelines before contacting Service Force. Ensure that the appliance is correctly wired, switched on, and allowed to cool adequately. If the top or other elements are not functioning as expected, refer to the operating instructions closely. Monitor the temperature to ensure it remains within the recommended range, using a thermometer if necessary. It’s also important to make sure all functions are correctly selected.
