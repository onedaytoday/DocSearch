The positioning of the hose and its connections is critical for effective coating application. If the hose is subject to temperatures below 0°C or if it is wrapped around coal-burning equipment, it can impede functionality. Ensure that the hose is properly connected to the water supply, as any breakdown can lead to operational issues.

When attaching the hose, be mindful of the threading to ensure a secure fit. If the hose is too short, consider purchasing a suitable extension that adheres to local authority and building regulations. Refer to the "Technical Water-stop" section for guidance on hose specifications.

For optimal performance, the hose should be installed with adequate ventilation and at a height greater than the equipment it serves. Be sure to check the rating plate for required specifications. 

Please take note of the warnings regarding grounding and compliance to ensure safety. If the supply needs to be replaced, do so in accordance with service guidelines and dispose of household waste responsibly, following recycling protocols. For detailed recycling information, please refer to local services or the retailer from which the hose was purchased.
