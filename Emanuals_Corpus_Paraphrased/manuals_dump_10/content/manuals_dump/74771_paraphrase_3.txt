### Technical Paraphrase:

### Mechanical Issues and Maintenance

If you encounter mechanical problems or breakdowns, please contact AEG Service Force. Ensure that food items are allowed to cool before and after cooking. High-pressure containers, like fire extinguisher cylinders, must not be tightly packed with foods as they may burst due to increased pressure. 

To turn off the appliance light, press the designated switch as indicated, ensuring the light cover is secure. Be cautious of electrical shocks; the appliance should be disconnected before any maintenance. 

Always maintain a proper temperature for food storage. If the appliance fails to function properly—such as producing too much or too little cold—refer to the 'Initial Troubleshooting' section. Food should remain within the specified temperature range, and any malfunction may lead to longer cooling times. 

**Ice Cube Preparation**: When making ice cubes, ensure that the appliance is functioning correctly. For any repair needs that require expert assistance, contact AEG Service Force, particularly for issues that may involve electrical components or mechanical breakdowns. 

**Cleaning Guidelines**: Regularly clean the interior and exterior surfaces of the appliance with non-abrasive materials, avoiding harsh chemicals. Ensure defrost water does not overflow; it should be managed carefully. 

Any items resulting in excess moisture, such as polythene bags or newspaper layers, should never be left in the appliance. While cleaning, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the electricity supply to avoid shocks. 

For additional guidance or service inquiries, please contact AEG Service Force or visit their website for further information. Proper handling and storage of food will help maintain optimal appliance performance and prolong food freshness.

The warranty coverage for the initial purchaser applies to repairs or services performed. If the appliance requires repairs due to unauthorized use or attempts at tampering, the purchaser should contact the authorized AEG service. Should the appliance be relocated to another country, specific instructions must be followed to ensure compliance. This warranty, applicable within the European Community (EC), transfers any repaired items to AEG’s ownership. The initial purchaser’s rights and obligations are determined by the product’s country of origin.

For installation, ensure the appliance is placed in a suitable environment, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. If temperatures rise, consult the installation instructions carefully. The thermostat (B) controls the appliance’s operation, and the indicator light (A) signals its status. The yellow light (C) activates when the device is functioning. Please pay attention to wiring connections as they must conform to safety standards. 

When installing, avoid obstructing ventilation spaces. It is crucial to ensure that the appliance is securely grounded to prevent electric shock hazards. In cases of malfunction, refer to the AEG Service Force for support. Recycle materials responsibly following local regulations and ensure any cleaning or maintenance is performed with the power supply disconnected.
