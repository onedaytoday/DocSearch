### Service Function Edition Overview

**Supply Function:** This section addresses normal supply functionalities such as water program selection and thermostat controls (e.g., K51, A:17, B11, etc.). The cooling and heating systems, along with their respective protections (e.g., overheat protection), are integrated within this framework to ensure efficient operation. 

**Cool-Down Functions:** The normal cool-down process operates as follows: When initiated, the system runs through specific cycles, including the opening and closing of valves (e.g., Y11). The thermostat will adjust the water temperature during these cycles to maintain desired levels. The cool-down steps involve sequential adjustments, which may include various time intervals for operational states and integration with prewash functions.

### Troubleshooting Service

In case of service interruptions, it is essential to identify the malfunctioning components: any displayed error or symptom may necessitate power cycling the system or checking built-in diagnostics. Remember to verify the status of switches and other control elements to rectify issues.

### Functional Feature Description

The activated functions can be switched on or off to manage operations efficiently, including heating or cooling actions. Each function has specific parameters that dictate its operation mode (e.g., heating, motor direction). 

### Final Notes on Operational Security

For safety, operational phases are monitored, ensuring that the system only operates if safety conditions are met. Operations cease if temperatures exceed predefined thresholds, protecting the system. Each function, including prewash and cooling, has defined activation protocols to guarantee secure and effective operation. 

In summary, the service functionality extends to monitoring supply, controlling temperature, and ensuring the system operates within safe limits, enabling efficient maintenance and troubleshooting processes.

### Service Function Overview

**Function Activation and Selection**  
The functions identified as P02 are activated when the built-in settings are enabled. This includes the pre-wash feature, which can be reduced in intensity based on system settings. When heating is engaged, it is essential to ensure proper cut-off to avoid overheating. This mechanism allows for pre-wash heating and ensures that other functions like the closed loop also engage appropriately.

**Selector Functionality**  
The edition of the Service Function includes the Cold Selector as Card C:11. The system supports various supply modes, both with and without heating. The normal action sequence is initiated from the cold settings and operates on a timed basis, determining the frequency of rotations and pauses.

**Water Supply Management**  
This section outlines the management of water functions, specifically focusing on the desired temperature settings. The system utilizes various connections (e.g., Y11, Y12, Y22, Y24) to regulate water flow and ensure optimal pre-wash conditions. If water flow is below a certain level, the system will adjust accordingly to maintain functionality.

**Heat Protection and Control**  
Temperature control is managed through the interaction of several switches, ensuring no overheating conditions occur. The system will automatically switch off during critical phases and enable cooling when necessary.

**Function Selections and Adjustments**  
Users can adjust settings based on specific functionalities such as pre-wash and rinsing cycles. The system's configuration allows for options like "Water Cool" and adjustments to the pre-wash intensity, supporting both user engagement and automated responses.

**Security and Overheat Protocols**  
To ensure safety, the system incorporates multiple layers of protection, automatically locking functions during operation and cooling down components post-heating. The integrated safety measures include provisions for immediate disconnection in case of fault detection.

**General Operation Summary**  
The service function is designed to provide a comprehensive interface for managing all operational facets, including the selector for water temperature, intensity of washes, and timing controls. Regular maintenance and checks are recommended to maintain optimal performance and prevent system failures.

### Service Function Overview

The Service Function Edition outlines the activation and management of components such as Y1, C, and X71:1. When the Y1 valve is activated, it regulates the supply to specific sections, including the cooling and prewash stages (P1+, P2+). This includes details on optimal conditions for various processes, ensuring functions are executed correctly and sections are closed when necessary.

**Service Activation**  
Functions are controlled through the system where each component is activated by a designated switch, with certain mechanisms like K51 and M21 involved in the process. The interface ensures the correct operation of heating elements, activated by turning buttons on the control panel. Safety measures include an integrated thermostat (B11) that prevents overheating by automatically shutting off when a specific temperature is reached.

**Component Relationships**  
The system features various relays and a memory board that manages input from the components. The relays interface with switches and sensors to ensure the system operates effectively, including monitoring shut-off conditions. Each of these components serves a specific function such as managing power supply or controlling water flow.

**Installation and Maintenance**  
Guidelines for installation specify the proper order and orientation of components to prevent nonfunctionality or damage. This includes securing screws and ensuring that protective covers are replaced correctly. All connections must align properly with designated locking mechanisms to avoid issues in operation.

**Water Management**  
The water system operates electromagnetically to control flow and pressure, ensuring efficient functioning. Maintenance steps include cleaning and verifying the integrity of hoses, especially the shut-off mechanisms. Suggested actions for troubleshooting include checking for blockages or damages in connections to prevent operational failures.

**Function Overviews**  
Each component within the service system has designated functions, monitored through built-in sensors and switches. This allows real-time adjustments and ensures all systems are working harmoniously, contributing to optimal performance and safety measures throughout the operational process.

For best performance, users should regularly check connections, clean filters, and ensure that all components are functioning as intended, following specified guidelines for maintenance and service adjustments.

### Service Edition  
This system enables activation through the hose supply, allowing for control of various components. It facilitates switching and managing the flow as needed in the system. The service heating edition includes three elements located at the front, including a heating switch (K2) and a thermostat, which can be adjusted as required to minimize burning issues. Adhere to the provided instructions carefully. To shut off the system, activate the switch and disconnect the supply by turning the screw counterclockwise. Once the system is disengaged, turn the screw clockwise to reestablish the connection. The thermostat interfaces with terminals L1, L2, and L3.

### Service Coin Edition  
This setup includes several coin types, which can be classified as a coin or a counter relay configuration. The system is effortlessly connected to the relay, allowing it to manage operations effectively. The relay activates throughout the process and disengages upon coin insertion. Various coin types are recognized by the counter, linked to either a microswitch or a relay, facilitating seamless transactions.

### Service Coin Microswitch  
For the Swedish version, this microswitch, functioning in a phase control capacity, is triggered by the motion of a wheel. The wheel’s rotation indicates to the microswitch the current phase. The system is designed so that the counter switch is OFF when not in use and ON during operation. The manual adjustment of the wheel can be executed using a screwdriver. The setup is engineered to prevent operational errors while maintaining essential functions, associating directly with a relayed mechanism.

### General Service Edition  
This system emphasizes plate integrity and torsional rigidity, mounted directly without shock-absorbing elements. Proper installation is crucial for stability. Follow the foundational instructions provided to ensure the plates are securely surrounded for optimal performance.
