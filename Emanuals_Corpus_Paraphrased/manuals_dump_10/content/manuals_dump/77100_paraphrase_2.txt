### OSD Functionality Overview

The OSD function automatically adjusts the brightness settings. Users can navigate options left or right to access factory settings or customize settings via the "USER" option. This customization allows individual adjustments of red, green, and blue balance, as well as using the OSD to specify YUV settings.

Select between DSUB and DVI input sources to change settings related to clock phase, intensity, saturation, hue, and flesh tone adjustments using the OSD. The OSD will close automatically after a specified period, typically designated in seconds.

### Touchmonitor Troubleshooting

If issues arise while using the touchmonitor, ensure that all cable connections are secure. If the display appears crooked or if resolution is too high, check the connections at both the outlet and the device. The touchmonitor should be properly grounded to prevent electrical shock.

### Active Resolution

For optimal performance, match the display's input resolution to one of the supported formats (VGA, SVGA, XGA, SXGA) specific to the touchmonitor. Using a resolution that exceeds the native capability of the LCD may result in artifacts or blurry characters.

### Touchmonitor Safety

To minimize static shock, turn off the touchmonitor before cleaning and use a grounded cloth. Avoid using ammonia-based cleaners and ensure that no liquids enter the device.
