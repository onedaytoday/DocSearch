### Cleaning and Maintenance Procedures

#### Cleaning Important Components
Ensure proper cleaning using appropriate methods and allow components to cool before handling. For cleaning, turn the part anti-clockwise to detach it from the system. Always wear gloves during this process.

#### Battery Safety Guidelines (Key Start Models Only)
When charging the battery, ensure the charger is properly connected and located in a well-ventilated area to avoid overheating and ensure efficient operation. The charger should not be covered or exposed to temperatures below 0°C. Regular maintenance involves cleaning with a soft cloth, carefully following manufacturer instructions concerning the electrical components.

#### Charging the Battery 
Charge the battery fully and avoid prolonged charging to prevent damage. Consult the user manual for specific charge times, typically requiring several hours depending on the model. It’s crucial to perform maintenance at least every few months and keep the battery clean to extend its lifespan.

#### Regular Maintenance Recommendations
Carry out regular inspections and maintenance as per the user manual, especially after heavy use or exposure to harsh conditions. If you experience issues like overheating or battery failure, consult an authorized service center for assistance.

#### Warranty and Service Information
To maintain warranty coverage, ensure that the product is serviced regularly by authorized repairers within the specified timeframes. Repairs or replacements due to wear and tear are typically covered, while damages due to misuse are not.

#### Environmental Considerations
Products should be disposed of in compliance with local recycling regulations. The disposal of batteries should be coordinated with local recycling facilities, not through regular household waste.

#### Safety Precautions
Always wear protective clothing when handling fuels or lubricating oils. Consult local waste management authorities for proper disposal methods.
