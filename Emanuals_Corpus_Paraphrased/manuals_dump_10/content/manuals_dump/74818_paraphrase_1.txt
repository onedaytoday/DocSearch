# Operating and Installation Instructions for the EU Freezer

## Important Safety Information
Please retain this instruction manual for future reference. If the freezer is sold or transferred to another owner, ensure that this information accompanies the unit. Familiarize yourself with these guidelines to ensure the safe and effective operation of the appliance. 

**Warning**: The freezer is heavy; use caution when moving it. Always operate according to the specifications outlined in this manual. If any issues arise, contact Service Force for assistance. 

Do not allow children to interact with the freezer without supervision. Use the appliance only for its intended purpose, specifically for freezing food items. Avoid storing items directly in the freezer that could potentially lead to frost or freezer burn. Adhere strictly to the provided instructions to maintain optimal performance.

When defrosting, do not use sharp objects to chip away ice, and do not forcefully remove any components. Allow frost to thaw naturally.

## Instructions for Defrosting and Cleaning
Switch off the freezer and disconnect it before cleaning or servicing. Only authorized personnel should perform repairs. Improper handling could lead to serious malfunctions.

### Appliance Description and Operation
The thermostat is critical for temperature regulation. To set it, turn the knob (A) to the desired temperature. The appliance light (D) will indicate when it’s operating properly. For faster freezing, activate the fast-freeze switch (B), which should be used 24 hours before introducing fresh food.

**Warning**: If food begins to thaw, consume it promptly to avoid spoilage. Frozen food should not be refrozen after thawing unless it has been cooked.

### Tips for Usage
Expect normal operating sounds such as whirring or gurgling as the refrigeration cycle runs. Ensure that food items are stored properly to maintain optimal cooling and minimize spoilage. 

Avoid overloading the unit and ensure that there is sufficient air circulation. Use airtight packaging to prevent moisture absorption.

### Defrosting Procedure
Frost build-up should be addressed when it reaches approximately 1/4 inch in thickness. For defrosting:
1. Disconnect the unit from the power supply.
2. Remove the food and use protective layers to catch dripping water.
3. Allow the frost to melt naturally.
4. Clean and dry the interior before reconnecting.

### Maintenance and Cleaning
Before cleaning, always disconnect from the electricity supply. Use mild cleaning agents—never abrasive powders or strong chemicals—to prevent damage within the freezer.

### Troubleshooting
If the appliance is not operating correctly, check the following:
- Temperature setting (should be between 10°C to 32°C).
- Ensure that the door closes properly.
- Check for any blockages obstructing airflow.
 
If problems persist, contact Service Force for a qualified diagnosis.
