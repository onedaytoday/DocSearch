Regarding product selection, whether traditional powders or liquids were chosen is irrelevant. Traditional powders can be added directly to the garments, while traditional liquids require specific precautions. Alternatively, compact powders and liquids should be placed at the top or back of the machine as indicated in the user instructions.

Fabric conditioners help reduce wrinkles and facilitate care. They can be used in various washer types. It’s essential to follow the guidelines provided, including the use of MAX Bounce conditioning sheets.

Take note: Avoid washing loads that exceed the recommended capacity, particularly items made of synthetic materials which may pose fire hazards. Ensure that items do not contain dangerous substances.

Drying methods depend on the selected washing program, usually set to Normal (with a reduced duration). The chart specifies settings based on fabric type. If adjustments are necessary, use the START/PAUSE function to pause the cycle.

To achieve individual rinses, ensure items are distributed evenly in the drum. To activate the STAIN-Action function without surpassing the MAX capacity, use gentle settings.

For ease of operation, toggle between phases via the light indicators. The EXTRA RINSE option can be activated by holding down the SPIN SPEED and DRYING TIME buttons for a few seconds; this light will deactivate when the function is complete.

For the DELAY START option, the chosen time will display for a duration before commencing once the START/PAUSE button is activated. To silence the buzzer, hold the TIME SAVER and SPIN SPEED buttons simultaneously for a few seconds.

To begin the washing program, press START/PAUSE, which will initiate the countdown. If the DELAY START is active, the timing will reflect upon selection. Be aware that pressing the START/PAUSE button turns on various phase indicators.

If the RINSE HOLD option is in use, its corresponding light will remain on. To drain water without spinning, select the SPIN/DELICATE SPIN setting and ensure parameters match with the machine's operational standards. 

Warning: For non-stop cycles, ensure that all items are suitable for the washing type to avoid damage. During operation, always check that hoses are correctly positioned.

Refer to the drying guide when handling various fabrics like wool, cotton, and synthetic materials. Each fabric type has designated settings based on laboratory tests and recommended care instructions.

To maintain washing efficiency, regularly clean the machine and its compartments according to the guidelines provided. In case of machine errors, refer to the troubleshooting instructions for error codes such as E10, E20, or E40, which indicate specific operational issues.

Ensure that the washer’s components, such as hoses and door seals, are properly secured and closed. For any persistent issues, consult AEG/ELECTROLUX service support.

**Instructions for Setup and Usage of the Appliance**

Ensure that all components, particularly the hoses, are securely attached as per the manufacturer’s instructions. It is essential that the cleaning and emptying hoses are properly fixed to avoid any issues with the appliance’s operation. Incorrect installation can affect the performance, including the heating phases necessary for effective clothing washing. Additionally, pay attention to the door indicator lights, which indicate when the load is unevenly distributed. 

If there are any issues with the clothing not being properly cleaned, verify if the cycle and temperature settings are appropriate for the type of fabric. Stubborn stains may require pre-treatment before washing. If grease or similar substances are present, use the correct detergent and ensure thorough rinsing to avoid residue on the fabrics.

For appliances compliant with EC regulations, specifically EC 73/23/EEC and 89/336/EEC, consult the AEG/ELECTROLUX Service Force for support if mechanical problems arise. For further information on service and troubleshooting, visit www.serviceforce.co.uk or contact them directly.
