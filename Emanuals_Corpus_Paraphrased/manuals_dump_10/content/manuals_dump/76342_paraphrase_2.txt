**Cleaning and Maintenance Procedures**

For optimal cleaning, ensure that the appliance, which may contain scouring agents, is correctly maintained. If frost levels are low (below 0°C), execute the following precautions: turn off the appliance, empty it, and disconnect it before proceeding with any cleaning.

**Troubleshooting:**

In the event of a whistling noise, check the operational flow: charge status, connections, and appliance settings. Ensure the household appliance is turned off. Verify the selector is set correctly and all hoses are securely closed. Inspect the water outlet hose for blockages, as improper closure could impede performance.

If the hose becomes blocked, unscrew it from the appliance, allowing water to flow as per the installation instructions. Ensure that all hoses are functioning correctly and not obstructed, as per the manufacturer's recommendations.

Verify that the appliance is filled with sufficient water and that all connections are tight. Be mindful of the hose and cover settings. Check if the “RINSE HOLD” option is selected, and ensure that the outlet height conforms to specified parameters. 

**Troubleshooting Continued:**

If cleaning results are unsatisfactory or if incorrect treatments were used, such as grease or ointments, properly pretreat items that are heavily soiled. If issues persist, the appliance may require servicing.

**Warning Regarding Emptying:**

Before emptying the hose, allow the contents to cool down to prevent scalding. Release the hose from its connection and ensure it is completely vacuumed to maintain proper functionality. When reconnecting, twist the hose clockwise to secure it.

**Cleaning Protocol:**

Before beginning any cleaning, switch off the appliance. Unscrew the cover by twisting it counter-clockwise and inspect whether the housing is properly secured. If further assistance is needed, contact the AEG Service Force for support.
