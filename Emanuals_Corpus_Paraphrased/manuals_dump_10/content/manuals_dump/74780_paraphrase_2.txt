Ensure that the appliance is switched off and closed properly to maintain the optimal temperature and humidity levels needed for effective cooling. Allow food to come to room temperature before placing it in the shelves to prevent frost buildup. Foods should be placed in grease-proof containers if necessary. Depending on the design of the shelves, adjust their height either upwards or downwards as needed.

Store various food types appropriately according to their designated sections, which include confectionery, ready-to-eat meals, dairy products like yogurt, and meats and seafood. The cooler maintains specific temperatures for different types of food stored within. Refer to the chart for detailed instructions regarding cooling thresholds.

To activate features such as the FROSTMATIC function, use the buttons marked (I) and (K). The display will illustrate changes from the current (ACTUAL) temperature to the target (DESIRED) temperature. If the (I) or (K) buttons are not pressed, the settings will revert to the actual temperature after a few hours. The current and target temperatures will be displayed numerically.

To begin the cooling process, press button (A). The indicator light (M) will flash once the desired temperature is reached. If the (L) button is pressed, the device will switch settings according to the user’s requirements. The FROSTMATIC function will optimize conditions for fresh foods and protect them from spoilage. Manually switch off the FROSTMATIC feature if necessary.

When switching off the appliance, press (A). Ensure to clean thoroughly after use, allowing food to cool appropriately before placing it inside. Use proper ratings for storage capacity and follow guidelines on how to prevent unwanted heat buildup. Store products loosely to prevent freezing or bursting.

If issues arise that affect operation, consult the troubleshooting section or contact service support for assistance.
