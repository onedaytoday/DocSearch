### Addressing Reduced Suction

**Caution:** Ensure the power switch is off before servicing. If suction performance diminishes, inspect the hose for clogs or obstructions. Debris in the hose can restrict airflow, leading to reduced suction efficiency. Regularly clean and check for wear on the hose and other components. Adjusting the height settings between the front and back can also help optimize operation. The cleaner should always be positioned correctly on the surface it operates on for optimal performance.
