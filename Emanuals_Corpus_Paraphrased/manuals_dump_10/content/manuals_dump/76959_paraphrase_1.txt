**MAN-DRUIG Isolation Guidelines**: Achieving the necessary isolation, particularly for the battery supply, is crucial. It is recommended that the Protective Earth (PE) of the non-isolated DC supply is not connected to the Primary Reference (PR) of the isolated DC supply. The PE must not connect directly to the alternating current (AC) input. Care must be taken to avoid any connection of the PE to the supply in non-isolated systems.

**Warnings**: Connecting the PE to the PR of an isolated supply, which is then linked to a non-isolated DC supply, is prohibited. 

**Connecting DC Supply Notes**: To enhance electromagnetic immunity, twisted and shielded cables should be employed. The shield should connect to ground at one end and to the PE at the other to ensure a proper grounding layout. Install the M6 washer and M6 screw for securing the ground connection of the supply, and use M5 hardware to connect the PE. Optional connections to the VDC type may be made for enhanced flexibility and functionality during power outages.

**Supply Connection Instructions**: Pin connections such as J1-9 and J1-8 facilitate feedback and communication. It is advised to use twisted-pair, shielded AWG wire for proper operation. Ensure the shield is securely attached to the housing and connected to the chassis ground.

**Pin Configurations**: The configuration for the interpolated tachometer includes a series of functions labeled A, B, and C across different connections. Each function serves specific roles like feedback input and references. 

**Signal Assignments**: Documented assignments include various input/output functions for the DRU XX/YYY device, ensuring clarity in configurations for optimum performance.

**Feedback Types**: The device supports multiple feedback mechanisms, including interpolated tachometer feedback, with specific options available for motor control applications.

**Installation Instructions**: For effective assembly, follow the provided guidelines on connecting feedback loops, ensuring that all components are correctly aligned and secured.

**Note on Compatibility**: The system allows for various input configurations for advanced applications, including velocity control and positioning commands.
