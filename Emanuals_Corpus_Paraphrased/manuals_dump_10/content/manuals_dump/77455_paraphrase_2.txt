**Important Safety Warnings**  
To prevent the risk of fire or electric shock, avoid exposing this unit to rain or moisture. Ensure that it is not placed near heat sources like radiators. This is a Class I laser product, equipped with safety switches to prevent laser exposure when the door is open. Tampering with these switches poses a safety hazard. 

**Preparation for Use**  
Remove the transit card, which is included for safe shipping purposes. The device operates on two AA batteries (included) or can be powered using an optional AC/DC adapter (not included). When using batteries, ensure correct polarity. Replace batteries if you notice degraded performance or if the sound quality deteriorates. 

**Connecting Optional AC Adapter**  
Connect the AC adapter (not included) to the DC IN jack on the right side of the player and plug it into a standard 120V AC outlet. Note that using the AC adapter allows the player to operate continuously without depleting battery power.

Locate the OPEN switch, volume control, HOLD switch, and other functions from the buttons on the CD player. The LCD will display various indicators for track selection, programming modes, battery life, and more.

**Operating Instructions**  
The HOLD switch locks the controls to avoid accidental operation. To engage the BASS BOOST feature, toggle the corresponding switch during playback. The ESP (Electronic Shock Protection) feature uses memory to buffer sound, preventing audio interruptions.
