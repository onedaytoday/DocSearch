**Yeast Dough Cooking Instructions**

When working with yeast-based dough, ensure to utilize convection heating for optimal baking results. This involves preheating the oven using the convection setting to distribute heat evenly across the baking surface. For best results with cakes, pastries, and breads made from yeast dough, preheat the oven to the designated temperature to achieve the desired texture and rise.

**Baking Considerations**

Ensure the cake is not positioned too high in the oven, as this may lead to uneven cooking or excessive browning. Adjust the cake’s position if you notice any abnormalities, such as excessive rising or a longer baking duration than recommended. Proper greasing of pans is also critical to prevent sticking.

**Specific Bake Settings**

Utilize the appropriate settings for specific food types. For gratins and ready meals, adjust the shelf and convection settings. Always consult the roasting chart for meat and poultry to avoid burning and ensure proper cooking times. If necessary, adjust cooking times or temperatures for optimal results based on the type and size of the meat.

**Defrosting Instructions**

For defrosting, unwrap the food and place it on a plate in the oven. Covering the food can help to expedite the defrosting process. Be aware of the need for an extended defrosting time for certain items.

**Drying and Preserving Foods**

For the drying function, use convection heating with covered shelves. If preserving food, ensure items aren’t touching each other and follow specified temperature guidelines.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Prioritize safety when cleaning. Always turn off the oven and allow it to cool before cleaning begins. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubbers which could damage surfaces. Instead, clean with a damp cloth and appropriate cleaning products suitable for the unit.

**Lamp and Heating Element Caution**

When replacing bulbs or performing maintenance, ensure the power is switched off to avoid electric shock. Handle components with care to prevent damage.
