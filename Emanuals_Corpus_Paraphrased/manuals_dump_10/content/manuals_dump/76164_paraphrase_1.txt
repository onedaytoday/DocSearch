**Ducting for Fire Safety**

When installing ducting, itâ€™s critical to ensure it is designed for optimal fire performance. Avoid tight turns, as these can compromise the efficiency of the duct. If the ducting is not installed correctly, it may negatively impact the performance. For cookers or heating units, proper sealing is essential, particularly with specific types of burners. If there are other ducts present, they should be seamlessly integrated into the system.
