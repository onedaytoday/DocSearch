### Maintaining Your Wine Cooler

To ensure optimal performance and longevity of your wine cooler, regular cleaning and maintenance are essential. Use only high-quality, non-abrasive cleaners specifically designed for stainless steel. Avoid using bleach, steel wool pads, or any cleaners not intended for stainless steel, as these can damage the surface. 

For monthly upkeep, apply a suitable cleaner or polish. In case of stains, you can use Bon-Ami or a gentle cleanser with a soft cloth. Refrain from using abrasive pads like Scotch-Brite, as they may blur the stainless steel finish.

#### Wine Rack Removal/Installation

Ensure the cooler is disconnected from power before any maintenance. Take caution, as components may have sharp edges. To remove the wine racks, unscrew them securely, following the designated instructions. 

To replace the light bulb, start by removing the light housing cover. After replacing the bulb, reattach the cover until you hear a snap or click.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If the wine cooler is malfunctioning, review the normal operation checklist first. If issues persist, refer to the troubleshooting guide or contact a qualified service technician. Always provide the retailer with the unit's model and serial number, which are typically found in the upper right corner.

#### Safety Warnings

**Electrocution Hazard**: Never attempt to repair or service the unit while it is plugged in. Always disconnect the power before troubleshooting.

If the temperature is inconsistent, ensure the light switch is set to 'ON' and check for any obstructions in airflow. Adjust the temperature settings if necessary and allow several hours for changes to take effect.
