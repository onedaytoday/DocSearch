This section covers the use of the "and" function for coated items on the Light and Shelf, including three trays: Shelf A, Shelf B, and Shelf C. When cooking, the information applies to items placed at varying heights from the front to the back of the shelf. This allows for increased food options once cooled, as noted in the cooking instructions and dish selections. If the cooking temperature needs to be adjusted for variations in item height, please ensure to turn off the heat as directed. Recommended settings are specified for different types of cakes, including shortcrust and yeast-based options, and the following guidelines should be followed for preheating.

For roasting, ensure that food items are heat-resistant, and follow the specific instructions provided. Note that meat can be roasted directly or with marinades, and care should be taken to prevent burning or damage during cooking. The meat thickness affects roasting results, and it’s important to maintain cleanliness when preparing poultry or other meats.

The "Preserving" function is designed for items with twist-off tops and should be used to maintain appropriate sealing. Ensure items are adequately closed for optimal results. For drying, cover the food with greaseproof paper and cool overnight after switching off the machine.

For cake preparation, combine ingredients properly, greasing any necessary cooking surfaces. Yeast should be crumbled and mixed for a smooth dough consistency. Instructions for trout include seasoning and topping preparation.

When cooking meat dishes, properly prepare and season ingredients, and maintain appropriate cooking temperatures while ensuring cleanliness throughout the process.

For cleaning, ensure the appliance is off, and follow safety instructions to prevent high-pressure issues. Each component should be cleaned according to provided guidelines.
