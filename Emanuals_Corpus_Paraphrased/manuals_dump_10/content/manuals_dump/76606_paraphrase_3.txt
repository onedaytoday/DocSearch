This remote features functions that include USB connectivity. **NOTE: ITALICS** If it is not a TV, ignore this section.  

The reference remote activates when the front panel is closed and is brought to the forefront. If the remote is at the front, you can click to adjust the sound or return to the previous screen. It also allows switching the TV on. While recording, it enables playback of the ongoing recording. If at the front, pressing the LAST button or OK will navigate through the numbers. For navigation, using OK or the directional buttons allows you to scroll through content forwards or backwards. The display indicates live or recorded shows.  

You can show or hide on-screen menus and adjust the volume up or down. The replay feature allows you to rewind by a specified number of seconds. Fast forwarding is also available, allowing fast motion for several seconds. This includes the high-speed function and the Stop/REVEAL feature for revealing content. The TXT function is available for recording and adjusting size. There are three options for recording or selecting the current recording by clicking on the info button.  

The remote can function exclusively during recording. Once recording begins, the cache is cleared backwards from the current recording. The SIZE function can be utilized as needed. The HOLD function is for maintaining a setting, while the SELECT function allows for full-screen access.
