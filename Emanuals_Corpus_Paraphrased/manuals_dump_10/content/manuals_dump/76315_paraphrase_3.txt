Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a more natural and technical tone:

For the AEG-ELECTROLUX EWF1087, detailed information, specifications, and user instructions are available. If acquiring a hose, ensure it is specifically designed for this unit, which requires a single-phase, V-rated electrical supply. It's crucial to ensure proper grounding and compliance with electrical standards. Should the water supply need replacement, it can be done easily. The three hoses must be properly secured when connecting to the corresponding branch, ensuring it is grounded adequately.

Effective operation is achieved with a variety of programs that manage water temperature, including settings for up to 60°C and 95°C to minimize thermal shock during cycles. The control panel features indicators for various programs and functions, including Prewash. The display facilitates easy navigation through the options, making use of an interactive interface that allows users to select the desired programs efficiently.
