The AEG-ELECTROLUX EWF1087 is a technical appliance that requires specific information, specifications, and instructions for proper usage. For its installation, ensure you acquire the appropriate hose type suited for a single-phase, 230V supply. The system must be grounded, and any changes to the supply must comply with regulations. 

When connecting the hose, ensure it is securely attached, and pay attention to the ground requirements. The hose must be positioned at a safe height, avoiding sharp bends or kinks that could obstruct water flow. 

The machine handles a temperature range up to 95Â°C to reduce thermal shock during operation. It features a selection of programs, indicated by lights that signal the different functions and states, including Prewash. 

For ease of use, the display provides an interactive interface that guides users through various settings and options. You can find additional resources and instructions, including those from TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org), to enhance your understanding of the AEG-ELECTROLUX EWF1087.
