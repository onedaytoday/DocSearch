**Specifications Overview:**

The LK174 is a chrome-plated outlet designed for use with a perforated overflow. The LK174LO functions similarly to the LK174, also designed for overflow applications. The LK175 is another chrome-plated outlet compatible with overflow configurations. The dimensions are provided in inches, and to convert to millimeters, simply multiply by the appropriate factor. 

Included components for both models: rubber washers, friction washers, brass locknuts, and tailpieces. All specifications are aligned with functional standards and are intended to be comparable to other manufacturers' offerings. Production is based in the U.S. 

Dimensions for LK174, LK174LO, and LK175 products are specified, along with details for rubber stoppers and additional components.
