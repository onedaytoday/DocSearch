### MIXED FUEL COOKER CSIG INSTRUCTION BOOKLET

#### Important Information
This document outlines essential safety and operational instructions for the MIXED FUEL COOKER, compliant with British standards. Ensure that a qualified CORGI registered technician handles the installation to adhere to the specified gas supply type and rating. It is crucial to keep children away from the cooker while it is in use and ensure it cools down completely before allowing them near it. Children should never operate the cooker. 

#### Cooking Guidelines
Always consult these instructions while cooking. If you notice any issues, such as overheating or unusual sounds, discontinue use and contact an authorized service technician for repairs. 

#### Operating Instructions
The cooker features several modes, including GAS OVEN (RAPID, NORMAL, SIMMER), and ELECTRIC GRILL. Ensure proper functioning by rotating the control knobs counter-clockwise to activate them. If the flame fails to ignite, check all connections and reset the ignition. 

To achieve optimal heating, preheat the oven without food before cooking. The cooking racks can be adjusted to accommodate various dishes, but be sure not to obstruct any vents. The efficiency of cooking can vary based on the type and thickness of cookware used. 

#### Cleaning and Maintenance
Disconnect the cooker from the electricity supply before cleaning. For the stovetop, use a non-abrasive cloth with mild household cleaners. Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the surface finishes. If the top becomes heavily soiled, consider using specialized cleaning products. 

Ensure the cavities and surrounding areas are cleaned regularly to prevent any build-up that may pose a fire hazard. Never remove the flame spreader during cleaning. 

#### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues like the cooker not lighting or food cooking unevenly, check that the gas supply is switched on, the connections are secure, and the selected functions are appropriate for your cooking needs. For persistent issues, refer to a qualified service technician for assistance.

For detailed charts on cooking times and temperatures for various foods, consult the appendix section of this booklet.
