This section outlines the operation and features of the appliance, including three specific buttons. To activate the functions, press and hold the designated buttons for a few seconds until the LED indicator flashes. This indicates that the device is ready for operation. After a brief delay, you should hear an audible tone confirming the selected function.

To adjust cooking settings, use the designated buttons to increase or decrease cooking time. The function indicator will flash during this process. To turn off the appliance, press the corresponding button, which will also confirm the termination of cooking tasks with a tone.

Ensure that food is appropriately selected for cooking, prioritizing items such as fresh meat, which should be thoroughly cooked. Additionally, any residual grease or splatters inside the cooking cavity should be cleaned after use, using a cloth or appropriate cleaning solution.

When cleaning the appliance, allow it to cool down completely before starting. Use suitable cleaning agents that do not contain bleach or harsh chemicals, especially on painted or coated surfaces. For stubborn stains, a dedicated cleaning product may be required.

Always ensure that the appliance is correctly fitted and connected according to the manufacturer's specifications. Follow safety guidelines to prevent electric shock and adhere to local regulations concerning installation and maintenance.

If service is needed due to mechanical failure or malfunction, contact an authorized service provider. Ensure compliance with building and electrical codes, especially when installing or servicing the unit.

### Paraphrase:

Ensure proper alignment and setup: Start from the front and adjust accordingly. Measure from the front to the back and from the top to find the ideal location based on the recommended shelf height. Adjust the height of the unit by turning the front knobs either clockwise or counterclockwise. The wheels can be positioned by tightening the screws located at the front of the plinth. Rotate the screws clockwise to raise and counterclockwise to lower the unit. Make sure the plinth cover is correctly fitted to the cooker.

### Connecting Electricity:
**Warning:** Ensure the unit is earthed! Access the screw on the cover to connect the earth wires properly. Once connected, secure the cover with the appropriate screws, ensuring it is locked in place to prevent twisting. Please confirm that the wires are correctly identified as Earth (Green/Yellow), Live (Brown), or Neutral (Black).

### Connecting to the Gas Supply:
Locate the ISO internal thread at the top right of the rear for gas connection. Ensure the hose fits securely and complies with BS standards for temperatures exceeding 70°C. For LPG systems, use an appropriate hose and connectors based on installation requirements for G20, G30, or G31 gases. Check for gas supply integrity and proper injector functionality. Light the appliance and ensure everything is operating correctly.

### Commissioning:
Follow specifications for types II 2H3+* and confirm from LP to G20, G30, G31 supplies. The thermostat location is guided for countries GB and IE.
