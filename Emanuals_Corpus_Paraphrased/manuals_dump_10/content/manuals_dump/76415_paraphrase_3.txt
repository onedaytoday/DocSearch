**AM Black Water Guidelines**

The back of the unit is equipped with coded connections and threaded hoses. The hoses supplying water to junction Y must adhere to local authority and building regulations. 

The connection should be made to the heater, ensuring proper operation. There should be careful consideration of the height of the hoses and their appropriate positioning. The setup requires water to be permanently plumbed, with the hoses securely affixed. The hose should have an internal diameter of approximately [specify], and the top must be installed appropriately, avoiding elevation issues.

Warnings are in place regarding hose installation, especially concerning covering with any materials that might hinder performance. Ensure hoses are locked and aligned correctly for safe operation. Additionally, be cautious of electrical connections; appliances must be grounded. The switch for the electricity supply should be clearly rated and located at the top of the unit, utilizing components compliant with ASTA (BS1363 A).

Wiring colors must follow standard codes: Earth (green/yellow), Neutral (blue), and Live (brown/red). Proper insulation is necessary to prevent electrical hazards. If the supply needs replacement, contact Service Force for guidance.

**Building-In Guidelines**

Installation should follow the preparation and assembly instructions outlined in section A. Original assembly must be in accordance with specifications to ensure proper fitting of the unit with screws. The base height and thickness should be verified to align with the mounting requirements.

For secure installation, ensure all four fixing points are used and adjust for the necessary height. The mounting should be done carefully to provide adequate clearance at the top of the unit while maintaining a secure fit at the front. Countersunk screws should be utilized for this purpose.
