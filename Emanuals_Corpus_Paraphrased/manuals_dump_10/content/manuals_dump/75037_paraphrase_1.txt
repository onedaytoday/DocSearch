**English EMS2840 Instructions for Reheating Chilled Ready Meals**

To reheat chilled ready meals, select the Reheat option on the microwave. Once the food is heating, ensure it reaches the appropriate temperature. Refer to the Cooking Selection Chart to determine the correct settings. If using the AUTO COOK feature, make sure to press the necessary buttons to initiate the process. If you need to stop or clear the program at any time, use the Stop/Clear button.

For cooking, use the high setting to avoid food splatter or uneven cooking. Make sure the food is placed correctly on the turntable, and that the turntable is rotating freely during operation. Follow the Microwave Cooking Charts for various foods, ensuring they are cooked at 600W power.

**Defrosting Instructions**

For defrosting, make sure the food is microwave-safe and use the appropriate power setting (180W). Monitor the defrosting closely. For best results, cover the food with a plate or plastic wrap to retain moisture. Items such as poultry should be shielded to facilitate proper thawing. If the food is wrapped, remove the packaging before cooking.

**Cooking Meat and Poultry**

When cooking or defrosting meat and poultry, refer to the specific charts provided in the manual for guidance on times and methods. Turn the meat as suggested to ensure even cooking. 

**General Microwave Cooking Guidelines**

Use microwave-safe containers and prefer round dishes to ensure even heating. Keep food covered to prevent spattering, and avoid using any non-recommended materials that could melt or catch fire. Monitor cooking times, as some foods may cook faster than indicated.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

To maintain the efficiency of your microwave, clean the interior regularly. Use a damp cloth and avoid abrasive cleaners or steel wool, as these can damage surfaces. Ensure the cavity is cool before cleaning. Do not use utensils to scrape the interior surfaces.
