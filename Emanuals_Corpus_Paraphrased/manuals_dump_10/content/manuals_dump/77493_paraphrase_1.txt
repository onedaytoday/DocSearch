**AM/FM Clock with Atomic Clock User Manual CKA1100**

**Safety Precautions**  
To minimize the risk of fire or electric shock, do not connect this device to an extension cord, receptacle, or outlet unless the blades can be fully inserted, preventing exposure. Keep this appliance away from rain and moisture. For safe operation, follow all instructions included in this manual. Clean the device only with a dry cloth. Avoid placing it near heat sources, such as amplifiers, that can produce excessive heat.

**Warnings**  
- **Risk of Electric Shock**: Do not open the unit.  
- **Caution**: To reduce the risk of electric shock, do not remove cover; there are no user-serviceable parts inside. For repairs or servicing, contact qualified personnel.

Thank you for purchasing the CKA1100 clock from Emerson Research. The CKA1100 is synchronized with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) atomic clock, which is also used by agencies like NASA. This clock can automatically adjust for Daylight Saving Time.

**Important Notes**  
Avoid exposing the clock to direct sunlight or excessive heat, and follow all FCC guidelines for installation to prevent interference. Should you experience any interference with the signal reception, refer to the troubleshooting section in the manual.

**Setup Instructions**  
Before use, unpack the device and ensure all cables, including the AC power cord and WWVB antenna, are securely connected. The device operates at 120V AC. 

**Battery Backup System**  
The CKA1100 is equipped with a battery backup system powered by AA batteries. This system maintains clock settings during power outages, but must be replaced periodically as indicated by the "BATT LOW" indicator.

**Control Panel Overview**  
Key features include:
- Date/Month display
- Time settings
- Alarm mode
- Snooze function
- WWVB signal reception indicator
- Volume control
- Band selection (AM/FM)

**Operating Instructions**  
The CKA1100 receives time signals transmitted from WWVB. Ensure proper placement to maximize reception, especially avoiding interference from large structures. The clock automatically attempts to synchronize with the WWVB signal at the top of each hour. 

**Setting the Clock**  
For optimal clock performance, position it at a location free from interference. Install fresh batteries and confirm that the "BATT LOW" indicator is off after connecting to a power outlet. Adjust settings as necessary for your time zone.

When the WWVB signal is activated, the clock synchronizes to display seconds as well as the month. If you are situated in the Eastern Time Zone, there is no interaction needed with the U.S. clock while the signal is active. The device must adhere to specific time zones: Central, Mountain, and Pacific. The clock automatically adjusts when it is powered on. In the event of a power outage, the clock reverts to its original time zone once power is restored. 

To manually receive the WWVB signal, hold down the TIME and DATE/MONTH buttons concurrently. Adjust the MONTH and DATE settings using the DATE/MONTH and TIME buttons until the desired information is displayed. Ensure to set the AM/PM correctly; if the AM indicator is displayed, it signifies morning hours, while PM signifies evening hours.

For synchronization, you can either let the clock automatically receive the WWVB signal or manually turn it on every hour to minimize interference and improve clarity in reception areas within the U.S. The seconds can be adjusted using the TIME/SECONDS button, and the clock can be set for alarm functions—either for a buzzer, radio, or both with various settings and options.

To listen to the radio, select AM or FM using the designated buttons. Press the RADIO ON/OFF button to activate. Adjust the tuning knob to find your desired station and use the VOLUME control to set the audio level. When finished, turn the radio off using the RADIO ON/OFF button.

For alarm settings, use the ALM 1 or ALM 2 buttons to set the wake-up times. Ensure the correct option (BUZZER or RADIO) is activated on the alarm, and make any necessary adjustments. The snooze feature can be accessed using the SNOOZE/SLEEP button.

The Sleep Timer allows the radio or alarm to turn off automatically after a set time. Press the SLEEP button to activate, and select the desired duration. Upon setting, the clock will manage the timing accordingly.

In terms of maintenance, dust the clock with a soft cloth and clean more rigid surfaces with a mild solution. For assistance, contact the Emerson Consumer Branch for setup and operational support.
