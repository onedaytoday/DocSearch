**Installing the Cooker Hood**

**Extraction and Ducting**  
The screws at the top of the unit are provided for installation. For optimal performance, the extraction method can be either ducted or recirculated through charcoal filters. Ensure compliance with British Standards or DIN 4102-B1 when ducting. 

The charcoal filter should be installed securely, allowing for effective air circulation through the outlet. It is advisable to position ducting as directly as possible to maintain system efficiency. If ducting exceeds the recommended length, it may diminish performance. In cases where the cooker hood is near heat sources, ensure the installation is sealed and appropriate for high temperatures.

**Chimney Installation**  
The chimney structure includes an upper and lower section. The upper chimney should be adjusted slightly to align correctly with the outlet, using the four screws provided. Likewise, the lower chimney should also be adjusted as necessary, secured with the included screws.

For detailed guidance on electrical connections, refer to the specified section.
