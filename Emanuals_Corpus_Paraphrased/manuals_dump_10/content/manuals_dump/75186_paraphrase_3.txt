### Important Safety Instructions  
**Warning:** To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Ensure the oven is properly installed and grounded in accordance with local building codes or the National ANSI/NFPA (U.S.A.) or CSA C22.1, PART 1.
2. Allow the oven to acclimate to room temperature (0°C/32°F) for at least 2 hours before connecting to the power supply.
3. Service should only be performed by qualified technicians to reduce risk and ensure compliance with safety standards.
4. Keep flammable materials, such as cookbooks, plastic utensils, and towels, away from the oven.
5. Children should not be allowed near the oven. Never touch interior oven elements or surfaces until they have cooled, as they can cause burns.
6. In case of grease or water fires, smother the flames with a lid or a foam-type extinguisher, and never attempt to extinguish them with water.
7. Avoid heating unopened food containers as build-up can cause them to burst.
8. Ensure that air ducts are unobstructed for proper airflow.
9. Handle oven racks when they are cool to avoid burns.

**Important Instructions for Cleaning Your Oven**  
Clean the oven regularly to prevent grease from accumulating and potentially catching fire. Refer to the specific cleaning instructions for your model, especially for self-cleaning ovens.

**California Proposition 65 Notice:**  
The state of California has determined that certain substances present in the appliance may cause cancer or reproductive harm. Customers are advised to consult these safety notices.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure proper usage and maintenance of your wall oven.

### Instructions for Preheating

**Preheating**: Always preheat the oven before cooking or roasting food. Set the temperature between 170°F to 550°F. To preheat to 350°F, adjust the racks accordingly. The display will show "PRE" while heating and will turn off when the desired temperature of 350°F is reached.

**Placing Food in the Oven**: Once the preheating is complete, you can place the food inside. For preheating to 425°F, follow similar steps, and the display will show the status until it reaches 425°F.

### Baking Instructions

Make sure to preheat according to instructions, especially when baking items like cookies, bread, or cakes. A proper preheat ensures even cooking and prevents overcrowding, which can lead to uneven heat distribution. 

**Adjusting Temperature**: For medium-weight foods, allow for a temperature variance of up to ±25°F (12°C) from the recommended settings if needed.

### Convection Baking

**Convection Cooking**: The convection setting circulates heated air around the food for even cooking, making it suitable for roasting, baking, and defrosting. Cooking times may be reduced, so adjust based on the type and quantity of food.

To preheat for convection cooking at 350°F, press the necessary buttons until the display shows that the system has reached the set temperature.

### Timed Baking

For a **Timed Bake** or **Timed Convection Bake**, set the desired time and temperature (e.g., 350°F). The oven will turn off automatically after the preset duration. 

### Broiling

**Broiling**: Preheat the broiler until it gets red-hot. Follow the cooking instructions closely to avoid burning food while allowing grease to escape. Ensure that you manage the heat to prevent flare-ups.

### Convection Roasting

**Roasting**: Ensure food is securely positioned and allow for proper heat circulation. Preheat to your desired temperature (between 300°F and 550°F), checking that the oven is ready.

### Cleaning Instructions

**Self-Cleaning Feature**: When using the self-cleaning function, do not use any additional cleaners or coatings. Ensure the oven is empty and allows the cavity to cool afterward. 

To activate, set the cleaning to light or heavy based on usage, which may take 1-3 hours. The display will show the status as it cleans. Wait for the “DOOR LOCKED” light to go off before reopening the oven. 

Always take precautions to avoid burns, and ensure that children are kept away during cleaning cycles.

### Starting the Delayed Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate the delayed self-cleaning cycle, select the Clean function and set the desired start time. Ensure that the oven door is closed, and the clock is set correctly. The self-cleaning will start and end automatically at the designated times.

### General Cleaning

Before cleaning, make sure the oven is turned off and has cooled down. Address spills and heavy soil as soon as they occur, as regular maintenance minimizes the need for extensive cleanings in the future. For painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces, use a gentle cloth for cleaning. Avoid abrasive cleaners that may cause scratching. For built-up grease, apply a suitable cleaner directly to the affected area and wipe with a cloth.

### Care and Cleaning of Stainless Steel

Refer to the Cleaning section for tips on maintaining the appearance of stainless steel. For oven door removal and replacement, follow the manufacturer's instructions, which typically involve rotating latches located at the front of the oven. Be cautious to avoid scratching the surface, as this can affect the finish.

### Common Issues

If the oven control beeps and displays F1 through F10, cancel the current operation and consult an authorized servicer if the issue persists. If F8 appears, it may indicate a problem with the self-cleaning process. Ensure that the oven is properly connected to power sources, as interruptions can cause operational issues.

### Additional Cleaning Tips

- For excessive smoke during broiling, check that the oven door is closed and adjust the positioning of meat to allow proper clearance.
- If soil remains after the self-cleaning cycle, it may be necessary to manually clean the oven again to ensure optimal results.
