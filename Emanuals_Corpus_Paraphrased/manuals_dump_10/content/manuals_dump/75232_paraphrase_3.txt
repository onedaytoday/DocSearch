The Rothitherm preheating function is designed for reheating food, particularly for cooking or roasting meat, including options for crisping crackling. Follow the provided instructions for optimal results. Ensure that meats are monitored to prevent burning during the roasting process.

To preheat, set the temperature according to the thickness of the meat and the guidelines specified in the manual. It’s important to avoid overcrowding the shelf to allow for even cooking, and always keep the oven closed during this process.

For defrosting, utilize the defrosting function with a plate to prevent extended thawing times. Ensure food items do not overlap.

The drying function uses fan-assisted shelves for even air circulation—avoid stacking items directly atop one another to prevent them from touching.

For cleaning, always turn off the oven and allow it to cool before wiping surfaces. Use gentle cleaning methods to avoid damaging components, and ensure that self-cleaning options are used appropriately. 

Warnings include avoiding contact with high-pressure cleaners or abrasive materials which could cause damage. Before servicing, ensure the unit is powered down, and always handle light bulbs with care.
