The unit is designed with coolers operating at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C, featuring specific thicknesses and options for built-in or external components. These three coolers, equipped with pre-charged cooling systems, are constructed using advanced injection techniques that enhance performance while utilizing high-quality, pre-painted polyurethane insulation. The design is eco-friendly, being free of CFCs and HCFCs, and incorporates rounded internal corners for safety and aesthetics.

The fast-fit design facilitates easy installation and ensures airtight integrity, utilizing high-density PVC. The coolers are compatible with refrigerants R404A and can operate efficiently at external temperatures up to +43°C. Defrosting is optimized through a heated system to minimize duration and enhance operational efficiency. An interior lighting system rated IP54 is included, along with features such as an ON/OFF switch and a thermostat to manage temperature settings. The right-hinged doors are designed with smooth, rounded edges for improved sealing and insulation, contributing to reduced operational costs and compliance with HACCP standards.

Technical specifications include height, HP rating, electrical supply details, and accessories such as aluminum shelves, micro-switches, temperature recorders, and plastic curtains designed for specific door clearances. Python connections for cold rooms and HACCP printers are also part of the offering, providing efficient operational support.
