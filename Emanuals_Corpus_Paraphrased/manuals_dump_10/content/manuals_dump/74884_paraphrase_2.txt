### INITIAL START-UP

Before starting the unit, ensure it is ready for operation. Ship the unit with the power switch in the OFF position. Connect it to a 115V grounded power supply, then switch it ON. Allow a few seconds for the system to power up. The unit should function properly within the first few hours of operation.

### CYCLE SELECTOR SWITCH

#### NORMAL OPERATION

Water continuously flows through the assembly to the trough until it reaches a specific thickness. Once this thickness is achieved, the system will cycle off to maintain cleanliness and optimal performance. During this time, you may hear operational sounds indicating proper function. Variations in ice cube thickness can occur due to factors such as batch differences.

### ICE DISPENSER OPERATION

The thickness setting impacts factory performance. As the ice becomes thicker, it can lead to operational issues. Warning signs may appear if the thickness exceeds the recommended level, leading to screw adjustments on the front panel.

### ICE CUBE THICKNESS ADJUSTMENT

The thickness dial is factory-set. Adjust the dial clockwise to thicken or counterclockwise to thin the ice cubes. Allow the unit to stabilize for several hours after making adjustments. 

### SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

For optimal performance, keep the unit out of direct sunlight. If the ambient temperature is expected to drop below 45°F (7°C) or exceed 110°F (43°C), remove the unit from warranty coverage. 

### MAINTAINING AND CLEANING YOUR ICEMAKER

Regular cleaning is vital for efficiency and longevity. Use only cleaners specifically designed for stainless steel, avoiding abrasive pads like steel wool, which can damage the surface finish. Monthly cleaning is recommended, especially if the unit is frequently exposed to harsh chemicals. 

### AUTOMATIC CLEAN CYCLE

To maintain efficiency, perform a thorough cleaning every three months. Follow specific instructions, including the care of screws and components during the cleaning process.

### DRAINING FOR NON-USE

If the unit will not be in use, disconnect it from the power supply to avoid electrical hazards. Store the unit properly when temperatures are anticipated to fall below the warranty-covered range.

### BEFORE YOU CALL FOR SERVICE

Should the unit malfunction, refer first to the troubleshooting guide. Ensure it is powered correctly, and check all connections. If further issues arise, contact the distributor for support, providing details such as location and observed problems. 

### TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

If you encounter issues, check the water supply and surrounding environment to ensure they meet operational standards. If service is needed, refer to the original purchase information for efficient resolution.
