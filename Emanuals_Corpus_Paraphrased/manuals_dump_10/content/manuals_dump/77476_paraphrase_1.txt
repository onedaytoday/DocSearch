However, itâ€™s still possible for interference to occur during installation. If interference is experienced, separate the device from the affected loads or reset it as necessary.

**Preparation for Use:**
- Ensure the clock is securely connected to a 120V AC outlet. Avoid exposure to direct sunlight or high humidity, as these conditions can negatively impact performance.

**Setting the Clock:**
- To set the clock, connect it to an AC power source and follow the on-screen prompts to select the appropriate time zone and settings.
- Adjust the Month and Date by pressing the corresponding buttons; ensure the set time reflects AM or PM correctly as indicated on the face of the clock.

- Always refer to the user manual for detailed operation instructions and safety guidelines.

The text outlines the operation of a device, likely an alarm clock or radio, detailing features such as alarm settings, tuning, and memory recall functions. To activate the alarm, navigate to the ALARM and ALARM MODE settings, ensuring the selection of the DAY OF WEEK for operation. Release these settings as needed while monitoring the current time.

To turn on the radio, press the RADIO ON/OFF button, and adjust the BAND to either AM or FM. Set the VOLUME to an appropriate level, then use the TUNING controls to find a station; make slight adjustments as necessary. To retrieve preset stations, press MEMORY, indicated by "P XX," and navigate through your saved locations. 

If AM reception is poor, use the internal FM antenna; for FM, connect to an AC power source. To manage alarm sounds, press the ALARM or ALARM buttons as necessary; the BUZZER can be adjusted and will automatically turn off at the set time.

The SNOOZE/SLEEP function can be activated to delay the alarm, with customizable durations. The DIMMER feature adjusts brightness, which can be set to high by default. 

Battery maintenance is crucial; replace the built lithium battery (CR2032) when prompted by the LOW BATT indicator, ensuring the replacement is of equivalent type to avoid hazards. If the clock loses power, memory can be restored with a fresh battery, but time and date settings will need to be manually reestablished.
