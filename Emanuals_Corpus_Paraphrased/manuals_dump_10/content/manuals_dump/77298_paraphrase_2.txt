For comprehensive instructions and details, please refer to the specific sections noted above.

**Paraphrased Text:**

The system can connect with DVD players and is designed for various sound formats, including DTS and surround sound, particularly with settings like PRO LOGIC II, MUSIC, THEATER, and HALL. It supports both COAXIAL and OPTICAL inputs. When using RCA connections (with white for left and red for right), it's crucial to avoid damage by ensuring proper usage. Connections for CD or tape players can also use RCA cables. For digital connections, you can use the DIGITAL IN/OUT ports for CDs or MDs.

To power the unit on or off, press the POWER button. To activate AUX, press AUX; for FM broadcasts, use the STEREO button. The VIDEO button allows you to automatically scan stations. The REMOTE functions include various functionalities for playback, volume adjustment, and input selection, with specific buttons for accessing items like DTS/DOLBY 5.1CH.

The front panel has a display for information about the selected input. For headphone use, plug into the PHONES jack. The system helps to switch between different modes, including surround and stereo.

When utilizing DVD or video inputs, select the desired source, and sound will be directed accordingly. For radio operations, first turn on the TUNER, select either FM or MW, and then configure through AUTO/MANUAL tuning options. To store stations, use the MEMORY function.

The Radio Data System (RDS) provides additional information from compatible FM stations, displaying data like PS, PTY, CT, and RT when available. The system also offers speaker configuration options to enhance surround sound experiences, with functions to manage delay time and dynamic range control. It is recommended to adjust these settings based on the environment for optimal sound quality.

### TEST TONE  
The test tone function is compatible with DOLBY DIGITAL and DOLBY PRO LOGIC II. To initiate, adjust the MASTER VOLUME to the recommended level and press the TEST TONE button. This will cycle through each channel: L (Front Left), R (Front Right), LS (Surround Left), SUB (Subwoofer), C (Center), and RS (Surround Right). After selecting each channel, you can adjust the MASTER VOLUME accordingly. This process continues until all tones have been played. 

For Low Frequency Effect (LFE) adjustment, use the LFE MIX LEVEL setting. In cases where DTS or 5.1CH is used, ensure the VOL setting matches the desired output level. The LFE level can also be adjusted immediately after pressing the TEST TONE button.

When selecting channels, press CH SELECT to navigate through channels L, R, LS, SUB, C, and RS. 

### SURROUND MODE  
This surround mode creates an immersive atmosphere typical of theaters. When using DTS or DOLBY DIGITAL II, it is advisable to enable this surround function. The system automatically switches between DOLBY DIGITAL and DTS based on the input source. The SEGMENTS within the sound field are enhanced to provide better clarity and integration across channels. 

To ensure optimal surround sound from DVD or LD equipped with DOLBY DIGITAL, connect to the appropriate DIGITAL IN ports. This enables the system to create a fully immersive sound environment, emphasizing dimensional audio placement while maintaining sound quality.

### TROUBLESHOOTING  
If you encounter issues with audio balance, verify that your connections (Left/Right) are correct. The AVR-320 should produce sound evenly; if not, check if the input is securely connected. If you hear hissing or interference, confirm that the BALANCE settings are correctly adjusted and that all inputs are properly wired. Reduce interference by switching the SURROUND ON/OFF to disengage surround effects if necessary.
