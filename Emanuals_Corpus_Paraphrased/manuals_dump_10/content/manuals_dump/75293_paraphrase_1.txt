### Defrosting and Cooking Guidelines

**Defrosting Function**: This function is designed for foods that are covered in ice or frost, such as cheesecakes. 

**Cooking Charts**: Various charts provide information on cooking times and temperatures for different food types, including rashers, chops, and whole fish like trout and mackerel. It's important to adjust cooking times based on the thickness of the food.

- **Approximate Cooking Times**: Use the cooking chart for guidance on temperature settings (between 160-180째C) and internal meat temperatures (50-60째C, 60-70째C, 70-80째C).
