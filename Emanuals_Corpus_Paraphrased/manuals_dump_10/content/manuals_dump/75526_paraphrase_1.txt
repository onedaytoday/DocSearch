**GRILL USAGE WARNING**  
When using the grill for the first time, familiarize yourself with the sounds it makes. The grill automatically lights within seconds upon activation. The grill will turn off when the lid is closed. 

**IMPORTANT NOTES**  
The top operates effectively when the grill is cooling. Keep the grill shelf clear of splashes by using a cover or appropriate cleaning method to prevent fire hazards.

**GRILL PAN AND HANDLE**  
Ensure the grill pan is correctly positioned with the handle facing outward. When removing the shelf, make sure it is centered beneath the heating element.

**TIPS FOR GRILLING**  
Allow food to warm to room temperature before cooking to ensure even results. Foods should be prepared to appropriate thicknesses, seasoned lightly, and preheated as required. Turn food as needed for even cooking.

**GRILLING CHART**  
Reference the cooking times for different items, such as rashers, chops, trout, and toast, based on their thickness.

**TOP OVEN USAGE**  
The top oven is ideal for baking and should be preheated before cooking to the specified temperatures. Food should be arranged evenly on the shelf to ensure proper heat distribution. 

**IMPORTANT NOTES**  
Always allow dishes to cool before handling, and maintain a clear area around the top oven for safety.

**TOP OVEN SHELF INSTALLATION**  
Ensure shelves are installed straight and positioned correctly from the rear to the front of the oven.

**TIPS FOR TOP OVEN USAGE**  
The placement of food on the shelves is crucial. Centralize dishes to allow for heat circulation and prevent food from burning or creating excess residue.

**MAIN OVEN HEAT DISTRIBUTION**  
Understand the heat zones in the main oven—higher temperatures are found at the top, while the bottom remains cooler. Ideally, foods should be rotated during cooking for uniform results.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**  
Preheat the main oven for optimal performance. 

**MAIN OVEN SHELF INSTALLATION**  
Adjust shelves straight, ensuring a clear path from the back to the front.

**TIPS FOR MAIN OVEN USAGE**  
Central positioning of dishes prevents uneven cooking and reduces cleaning time. Different shelf placements can affect browning.

**COOKING CHART**  
Follow specific cooking guidelines for various dishes, adjusting shelf positions as needed for roasting meats and pastries.

**SLOW COOKING**  
This method is ideal for tougher cuts of meat and is cost-efficient. Maintain a steady temperature to ensure even cooking without browning.

**SLOW COOKING GUIDELINES**  
Allow meat to cook thoroughly, aiming for at least 88°C. 

**SOUPS, CASSEROLES, AND STEWS**  
Bring ingredients to a boil before transferring to the slow cooker, covering tightly to prevent moisture loss.

**REMOVING AND REPLACING WIRE WORK RUNNERS**  
Carefully unhook runners from the cavity and reinstall them as necessary.

**HOB CLEANING**  
After cooking, wipe down the hotplate and components to maintain hygiene. 

**REPLACING BURNER PARTS**  
Ensure proper alignment when reinstalling crowns to allow free movement and secure fit.

**CLEANING SHELVES, WIRE WORK RUNNERS, AND GRILL/OVEN ACCESSORIES**  
Most items are dishwasher-safe; however, if not, use appropriate cleaning methods to ensure functionality. 

**CLEANING INSIDE GRILL AND OVEN COMPARTMENTS**  
These areas should be cleaned manually to maintain the Stayclean coating. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that can damage finishes.
