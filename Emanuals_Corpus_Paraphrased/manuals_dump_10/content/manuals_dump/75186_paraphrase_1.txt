### Important Safety Instructions
WARNING: To minimize the risk of fire, electrical shock, or injury, adhere to the following precautions:
- Ensure the appliance is properly installed and grounded according to local codes (ANSI/NFPA or CSA C22.1).
- Do not service the appliance unless specifically instructed to do so or by a qualified technician.
- Keep flammable materials away from the appliance during operation.
- Supervise children around the appliance at all times. 
- Avoid touching interior oven surfaces while hot as they can cause burns.
- Use caution with unsealed food containers as they may burst when heated.

### Using Your Oven
- Ensure oven ducts remain unobstructed during operation.
- Always position oven racks when cool.
- For cleaning, ensure the oven is free from grease to avoid fire risks.

### Self-Cleaning Information
Utilize only the self-cleaning mode as directed in the manual, avoiding non-approved cleaners. Maintain the oven’s protective coatings for safety.

### Getting Started
Before using the oven, arrange the oven racks while the unit is cool. Engage the self-clean feature as indicated in the manual. 

### Control Panel Functions
Familiarize yourself with the control pad for effective use:
- Preheat, Convection, Bake, Clean, Timer, and Light functions.

### Clock and Timer Settings
To set the clock or timer, follow the prompts according to the user manual. For energy-saving settings, adjust as needed.

### Lockout Feature
To lock the oven, engage the lockout function to prevent unintended operation.

### Temperature Display Adjustment
Switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius as necessary using the control panel.

### Silent Operation
Activate silent mode as needed to reduce audible signals. 

### Adjusting Oven Temperature
If you find the heating inconsistent, adjust the temperature settings accordingly. 

For more detailed instructions, refer to the user manual provided with the appliance.

### Preheating Instructions

To preheat the oven, adjust the temperature between 170°F and 550°F. For a temperature of 350°F, press the designated button, which will indicate when the oven has reached the desired heat (the PRE light will turn off). During the preheating phase, ensure that cooking racks are properly positioned.

When preheating for roasting or cooking, allow the oven to heat adequately to maintain optimal cooking conditions. If preheating to 425°F, wait until the indicator shows readiness.

### Baking Instructions

Follow the specific preheating instructions for baking as necessary. For temperatures starting at 350°F, press the button to confirm the setting; the oven will alert you once this temperature is reached. The same applies for preheating to 425°F.

Be mindful not to overcrowd the oven to ensure efficient heat circulation. Proper spacing allows better cooking results and prevents heat retention from becoming ineffective.

### Convection Baking Instructions

Convection baking uses circulating hot air to cook food evenly. This method is suitable for thawing, roasting, and batch cooking. The temperature settings remain similar; always refer to the guide for using convection properly.

If cooking multiple trays, ensure each tray is appropriately spaced to enable optimal airflow. Preheating before placing food is also essential.

### Timed Bake / Timed Convection Bake Instructions

To use the timed baking feature, set your desired temperature (e.g., 350°F) and select the cooking time. The oven will automatically shut off when the time elapses.

### Broiling Instructions

To broil food, preheat the oven until the elements become red-hot. Place food evenly for optimal cooking, and monitor closely to avoid burning. Do not cover the food, as this can interfere with cooking results.

### Convection Roasting Instructions

Convection roasting involves cooking food evenly while allowing grease to drain. Ensure proper seating of the food in the oven to avoid disruption during the cooking process.

### Cleaning Instructions 

For self-cleaning, do not use chemicals or protective coatings. High heat effectively cleans the oven cavity. Ensure the oven is cool before self-cleaning, and always supervise children near the appliance.

When initiating self-cleaning, it generally lasts about one to three hours, depending on the selected intensity. The DOOR LOCKED indicator will display during this process. After cleaning, allow the oven to cool before use.



### Starting the Delayed Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate the delayed self-cleaning cycle, ensure that the necessary settings are adjusted. If the clock displays the time, set it to the preferred hour for cleaning, allowing the self-cleaning to begin and end automatically at that time. Make sure the oven door is closed. Press the “Clean” button and select the desired hour for the self-cleaning process.

### General Cleaning Guidelines

Before cleaning, ensure the oven is turned off and cool. Remove spills and heavy dirt promptly to prevent buildup. Regular cleanings can minimize the frequency of major cleaning sessions. For painted and decorative surfaces, use a soft cloth; avoid harsh cleaners that may scratch. For built-up grease, apply a suitable cleaner directly with a cloth. Do not use scouring pads, as they can harm the surfaces. Clean the oven's interior with a damp cloth and follow with a dry one. Use recommended cleaners specific for the oven's surfaces. If heating elements become soiled, clean them with a damp cloth. 

### Door Care Instructions

To remove and replace the oven door, locate the hinges at the front. Carefully rotate the top of the door while lifting it away from the oven. Refer to specific instructions for special care of the door to maintain its appearance.

### Common Issues and Solutions

For service-related issues, including oven beeping or error codes (F1 through F10), press "CANCEL" to clear the display. If error code F8 appears, ensure the self-cleaning function is operating correctly. If the oven does not work properly post-installation, ensure that it is securely connected to the power supply.

If the oven light is not functioning, check for a burned-out bulb and follow the instructions for replacement. 

### Self-Clean Cycle Issues

If the self-clean cycle fails or is interrupted, review the instructions for restarting. If excessive smoke occurs during broiling, adjust the position of the meat to ensure proper cooking and prevent grease buildup.
