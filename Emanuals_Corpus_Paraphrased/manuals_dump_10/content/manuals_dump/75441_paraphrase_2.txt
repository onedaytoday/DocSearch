The use of racks and offset racks is crucial during cooking to prevent food from coming into direct contact with hot surfaces, thereby reducing the risk of burns. Offset racks help maintain an appropriate distance from the heat source, ensuring even cooking. These racks are designed to accommodate various types of cookware, allowing for optimal airflow and heat circulation around the food.

When removing hot items, be cautious to avoid burns. Proper technique involves pushing the rack forward while securing it with both thumbs for stability. It's essential to prevent any obstruction against the cavity walls to ensure safe operation.

The type of cookware selected significantly impacts cooking efficiency. Cookware should be well-balanced, allowing for even heat conduction and easy cleaning. It is vital to monitor heat distribution while cooking to prevent overheating or undercooking.

To activate the cooking process, adjust the burner settings counterclockwise to the desired BTU output, ensuring the correct temperature for specific food items. Utilize the control panel for precise settings, including preheating options for different cooking needs. 

The cooking instructions include using the convection feature, which optimizes heat distribution for even cooking results. Preheating is essential for achieving the best outcome when roasting or baking, and should be initiated promptly as per the guidelines outlined.

In summary, understanding how to effectively utilize racks, cookware types, and controlled cooking temperatures, alongside implementing safety precautions, enhances the overall cooking experience. By following recommended practices, users can achieve optimal results while minimizing risks in the kitchen.

### Convection Cooking Overview

**Convection Cooking Mechanism**  
Convection cooking utilizes heated air circulation around the meat, cooking it thoroughly while minimizing moisture loss. This method is suitable for various foods, including meats and poultry. It's important to preheat the oven to achieve optimal results. Default factory settings are 350°F (176°C) for cooking, with specific guidelines applicable based on the food type. 

**Roasting Guidelines**  
For roasting, ensure proper placement of food in the roasting pan, which enables effective grease catchment and heat distribution. Avoid covering the food with foil during cooking to allow for even roasting. Various types of meat, including whole poultry and fresh cuts, should be cooked according to the Convection Roasting Chart to prevent overbrowning.

**Monitoring Internal Temperature**  
Utilizing a temperature probe is crucial for assessing the doneness of meat. The internal temperature should reach specific thresholds (e.g., 170°F/76°C for poultry) to ensure safety. Insert the probe into the thickest part, avoiding bone, to obtain an accurate reading. Monitoring is essential to prevent undercooking or overcooking.

**Cooking with Slow Cook and Other Options**  
For low-temperature cooking (like slow cooking), thoroughly thaw foods first and follow the suggested cooking time frames for different heat settings. Options available include HI (275°F/134°C for several hours) and LO (225°F/108°C). Select the desired cooking mode and begin cooking as needed.

**Defrosting Functionality**  
Using the convection setting, defrost food gently while ensuring it is evenly heated. Recommended temperatures range from 100°F (38°C) to 120°F (48°C). The defrosting function is ideal for uniform thawing of meats and other foods.

**Baking and Proofing**  
For baking yeast-leavened products, the dough should be lightly covered during proofing. Maintain a warm environment (around 100°F/38°C) for optimal rising. Select the appropriate settings for successful baking adjustments, monitoring closely to prevent overproofing.

**Sabbath Mode Operation**  
In Sabbath mode, certain features, like bake and heating, will function without notifications or disruptions. This setting maintains a steady temperature, ensuring food remains warm without further interaction required. Adjust settings as necessary prior to activation.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can enhance your cooking outcomes with the convection feature of your oven.

Here's a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

Below are instructions for using the oven’s baking feature. To initiate, press the BAKE button followed by either the UPPER or LOWER oven selection. Press both the LO and HI buttons simultaneously for a few seconds until a sound indicates it’s set, then release. Once the oven is properly adjusted, you can cancel any ongoing cooking features using the same process.

When cooking, it’s crucial to keep children away from the lower oven to prevent burns. Do not line the oven drawer or rack with foil, as this can obstruct heat circulation. Ensure that food items have adequate space for proper cooking and never obstruct airflow.

Monitor the recommended cooking temperatures for different food items, such as 350°F (176°C) for general cooking and 450°F (232°C) for higher temperatures. Immediately press the LOWER OVEN button to set a temperature of 190°F (88°C) for keeping food warm. Remember, cancel any operation if needed.

For safety, monitor cooking times, since improperly cooked food can pose a risk of food poisoning. This oven is equipped with a self-cleaning function, which should only be used when fully understanding its operation, as it involves high temperatures to clean the interior.

If adjustments to cooking times or temperatures are required, the user can navigate to the UPO setting for temperature offsets. Also, the factory settings can be restored to default if necessary.

Finally, follow proper cleaning guidelines, particularly for self-cleaning modes. Ensure racks are removed before engaging self-cleaning. Use appropriate cleaners to avoid damaging the oven’s finishes.

Refer to the cleaning and maintenance sections for specific guidelines on caring for both painted and chrome parts, ensuring longevity and optimal performance of the oven.
