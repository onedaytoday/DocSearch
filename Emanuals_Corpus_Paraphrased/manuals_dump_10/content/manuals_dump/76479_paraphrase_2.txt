**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**  
READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING THIS REFRIGERATOR. Unpack carefully to avoid injury from sharp items. Keep children away from the appliance to prevent suffocation, which can occur if sheets or other materials are used to cover the interior, creating airtight conditions.

**BEFORE DISPOSING OF YOUR OLD REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER:**  
Ensure safe storage of shelves and components to prevent injury.

Ensure the power cord is firmly plugged in and not at risk of tangling. Regularly inspect and prevent any pinching or other hazards.

**INSTALLATION**  
Select a location that is well-grounded, with ambient temperatures of 32°F (0°C) to 100°F (38°C). Maintain clear space around the appliance for adequate ventilation, approximately one inch on all sides. This space alleviates heating issues due to proximity to warm surfaces.

Use soft cloths and non-abrasive cleaners to avoid damaging surfaces. Be cautious when cleaning around electrical components.

Keep the appliance away from heat sources such as stoves and sunlight to enhance energy efficiency. Avoid overcrowding shelves to ensure proper airflow. 

**SETTING THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL**  
Allow food to cool for several hours after loading. Check the temperature settings and adjust if necessary, noting that factory settings may not be optimal for all conditions.  

**REFRIGERATOR FEATURES**  
The interior light activates when the door opens. Flexible shelves and automatic temperature controls are included for user convenience. 

**CARE AND CLEANING**  
For interior cleanliness, use mild soap and water, ensuring all areas are properly dried afterward. Clean the exterior with a soft cloth to avoid damage.
