### Tape Recording Instructions

You can record directly from a CD or via the built-in microphone. 

**Playing Compact Discs & Listening to the Radio**  
To record using the built-in microphone, set the function to TAPE (ensure RADIO is OFF). Press the STOP/EJECT button, positioning the tape correctly. Use only types like CrO (Chrome) or C-60 formulations. The tape should be prepared for recording. 

To start recording, press the RECORD button. For recording sounds captured by the microphone, ensure the microphone is set up correctly. To temporarily pause recording, press the PAUSE button. Once done, press STOP/EJECT to finalize.

Using the Automatic Level Control (ALC) will help manage recording levels and prevent distortion. 

**Headphone Use**  
You can connect headphones (not included) to the STEREO HEADPHONE JACK at the back. This will reduce speaker output. When headphones are connected, the speakers will automatically disconnect.

### Care and Maintenance for Cassette Tapes

Handle previously recorded tapes carefully to prevent damage. 

To prevent overwriting, break out the tab for the side of the cassette. 

When utilizing a cassette tape, ensure it is not too tight around the playback mechanism. To minimize issues, avoid excessive wrapping around the layers. 

**Head Cleaning**  
Regularly clean the heads to maintain performance. Switch the device off and engage STOP/EJECT. Use a cloth or head cleaner to clean the Record/Play Head.

### Compact Disc Care

To maintain CDs, always handle them by the edges. Use a lint-free cloth to clean the surface, wiping from the center outward. Avoid using abrasive cleaners. 

### Cabinet Care

If the cabinet becomes dirty, clean it gently with a cloth. Do not permit liquids to come into contact with the device during cleaning.

### Troubleshooting Guide

If issues arise, refer to the following troubleshooting steps:

- If the AM or FM station does not play, check the BAND switch and reposition for better reception.
