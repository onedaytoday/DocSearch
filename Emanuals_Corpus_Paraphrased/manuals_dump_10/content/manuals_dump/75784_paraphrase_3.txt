To activate the cooling feature, choose the desired options and press the corresponding buttons. After a period of inactivity (initially a few seconds), the system will default to basic functions. If sound notifications are enabled, the equipment will acknowledge deactivation when the relevant buttons are pressed. The cooling settings will display accordingly, and operations may cease when necessary. 

The Wave-Touch™ and IQ-Touch™ systems incorporate special functionalities that observe community rituals during the Sabbath. It’s important to note that, while Wave-Touch™ is engaged, you can activate or deactivate the Sabbath mode by holding the designated buttons for several seconds. When active, this helps navigate further operations without generating excessive notifications or sounds, ensuring smooth functioning.

The cooling system will enter manual recovery mode for health safety if high temperatures are detected. Users should be aware that once these adjustments are made, the system may reset to default functions if disruptions occur during the set period.

For optimal operation, ensure that the water supply supporting these functions is connected; otherwise, equipment may malfunction. During normal use, expect operational sounds such as water flow or clicks. To maintain efficiency, periodically flush the water supply and replace filters as necessary.

To change ice types or activate different cube settings, users should hold the designated buttons for three seconds. Be mindful that frequent water supply interruptions may require additional service.

The featured shelves are designed to minimize food spillage while providing easy access to stored items. Each shelf is adjustable to accommodate various food sizes efficiently. Ensure a proper cleaning routine by avoiding harsh chemicals and cleaning only with suitable cloths.

For any product within the Perfect™ section, follow specific cleaning guidelines to ensure longevity and proper operation. The system is engineered for flexibility, allowing users to select ideal temperatures for different food products by pressing the appropriate buttons. 

While removing or storing food, adhere strictly to guidance regarding shelf adjustment and item placement to prevent damage or inefficiencies.

Here’s a technical and natural paraphrase of the provided text:

To maintain optimal conditions, ensure the fresh food compartment is adequately covered and organized. Properly remove items from the front and back to enhance airflow. When loading, avoid overcrowding to facilitate efficient cooling, specifically for meat and poultry, which should be stored securely and separately from other foods. Items should be placed tightly in their respective areas to prevent spoilage and freezer burn. 

Regular maintenance is crucial: the fresh food compartment should be cleaned periodically, and the water filter should be replaced every few months to ensure the finest quality. Be attentive to normal operating sounds—these typically indicate proper functionality. However, unusual sounds could signal issues in the defrosting system or other operations.

For cleaning, do not use abrasive materials or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the appliance and void the warranty. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines, and ensure your freezer has adequate airflow around it to prevent ice buildup. 

Check the LED lights for performance—ensure they are functioning properly and clean their covers as needed. If the lights are not illuminating, examine the electrical supply and connections. 

In summary, routine checks, efficient organization, and careful cleaning practices will prolong the life and effectiveness of your appliance while ensuring that food is stored safely and effectively.

**Common Concerns Overview**

**Temperature Issues:**
- The system displays flashing indicators and alerts for low temperatures ("Too Cold"), indicating the need for adjustments. 
- Fresh food sections must be inspected for operational effectiveness, ensuring that temperatures remain within satisfactory levels. If items within these sections feel excessively cold or exhibit frost crystals, they should be allowed to reach warmer temperatures.

**Water Accumulation:**
