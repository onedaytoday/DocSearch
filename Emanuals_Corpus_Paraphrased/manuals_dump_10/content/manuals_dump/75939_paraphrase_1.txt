### Defrosting Instructions

The appliance automatically defrosts when frost is present. During this process, frost collects in the compartment and melts, with water draining away and evaporating at the base. Itâ€™s important to manually defrost if the frost layer becomes too thick, which usually needs to be done at least once when ice accumulates or when food is stored. 

**Warning:** Avoid using heat or mechanical methods that could interfere with the defrosting process, as this can pose health risks or damage plastic components. 

For optimal defrosting, switch off the appliance and let food sit, covered with layers of newspaper, to ensure a gradual cooling process. During defrosting, normal operational sounds such as whirring may occur due to the cooling system.

**Note:** To maintain food quality, avoid over-stacking items to allow for proper air circulation. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

**Safety Precaution:** Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning. Avoid harsh cleaning agents, especially those containing bleach, which can lead to electric shocks or damage. 

If the appliance needs extensive cleaning, it may take several hours to resume normal operation. After cleaning, ensure that all components are thoroughly dried before reconnecting.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions

If you experience issues such as inadequate cooling or malfunctioning lights, consult the troubleshooting section. Repairs should only be performed by authorized service personnel. 

For warranty claims, AEG covers defects in workmanship and materials for a limited period post-purchase, provided the appliance has been used according to the instructions. Unauthorized repairs may void the warranty.
