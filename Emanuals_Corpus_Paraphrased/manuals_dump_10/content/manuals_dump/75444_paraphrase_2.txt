### Instructions for Converting Range Operation to LP Gas

**Important Notice:** The installation and service for converting the range to LP gas should be carried out by a qualified technician. Please retain these instructions for the local electrical inspector's reference. 

**Warning:** Adhering to these guidelines is critical to avoid risks like fire, property damage, or personal injury. The service agency must ensure compliance with the provided instructions for safe operation.

**Caution:** Before beginning the conversion, ensure that the gas supply is turned off to prevent serious hazards.

### Tools Required for LP Conversion:
- Nut Driver
- Open End Wrench
- Wide Flat Blade Screwdriver
- Phillips Screwdriver

### Conversion Steps
1. **Convert Pressure Regulator:** Locate and adjust the pressure regulator on the unit. This is typically found on the right side. Unscrew, rotate, and reattach according to the LP specifications.

2. **Top Burner Conversion:** Remove and replace the natural gas orifices with LP orifices, ensuring the BTU ratings match the LP specifications. Tighten all components securely to prevent leaks.

3. **Oven Burner Orifice Conversion:** Loosen the screws securing the oven burner orifice, replace it with an LP-compatible orifice, and reassemble.

4. **Broil Burner Conversion:** Similar to the oven burner, replace the broil burner orifice with the appropriate LP orifice.

5. **Griddle Orifice Conversion (if applicable):** For ranges with both top burners and a griddle, replace the griddle orifice as described above.

6. **Gas Valves Adjustment:** Ensure all gas valves are modified for LP gas usage, following the correct specifications.

### Reconnections
Once the conversion is complete, reconnect the gas and electrical supply to the range. Perform thorough testing according to the guidelines to verify tightness of all connections.

### Air Shutter Adjustment for Oven Burner
- Adjust the air shutter opening to ensure proper combustion. 
- If necessary, fine-tune the air shutter to maintain an optimal flame.

### Installation of New LP/Propane Rating/Serial Plate
Document the new LP specifications and attach the updated rating/serial plate in a visible location on the range.

### Final Reminder
Ensure all work is performed in strict compliance with local codes and that the range is checked for proper operation after conversion.
