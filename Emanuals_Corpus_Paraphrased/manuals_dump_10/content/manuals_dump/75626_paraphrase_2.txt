**Installation Requirements:**

- Maintain a temperature range of 55°F (13°C) to 110°F (43°C) during operation. 
- Allow adequate clearance around the unit for proper ventilation.
- Use a flathead screwdriver or wrench for adjustments and ensure food items are easily accessible. Re-tighten any screws as needed.

**Connecting the Water Supply:**

To avoid water damage or injury, connect using a standard supply line no larger than the specified diameter.

**Operational Features:**

Utilize the Wave-Touch™ display to select ice cube options. The appliance provides visible status updates and options based on activity. Manual overrides are available, and pressing the relevant buttons for three seconds can change settings or deactivate features. The cooling system may be adjusted for optimal performance, with indicators for temperature status.

For comprehensive operational instructions, refer to the user manual or contact customer support for assistance.

### Wave-Touch™ Features

Wave-Touch™ is designed to integrate seamlessly with the community's cultural and religious practices. **Note:** While the Wave-Touch™ interface allows for ON and OFF functions and can be activated simply by holding the respective button for a few seconds, the system will display operational status when it is actively engaged for health-related reasons. If engaged in high settings, the system will produce an alert sound. The features will function normally once reset after use, without affecting observances during the Sabbath or Holidays. 

Although no lights will activate during deactivated periods, there may be a recovery time for the system. Important to remember is that the system each time it’s initiated. 

### Custom TM Operation

The Custom TM should be turned OFF when not in use, following the same ON/OFF protocol as the Wave-Touch™ setting. To deactivate, follow the instructions in the Custom TM section regarding turning it on or off.

CAUTION: Ensure the water supply line is correctly connected at all times to prevent operational issues. To manually reset the system, hold the ON/OFF button for three seconds; this will flush any accumulated water. 

### Ice Water Supply Management

To prevent malfunction, be cautious with the ice water supply. This system is designed to hold and cool water effectively for several hours, achieving a complete cycle approximately every 8 hours. For operation, turn the On/Off ice button by pressing and holding it for three seconds until the desired LED indicator activates. 

If the water supply is disconnected, use the On/Off soft-touch for three seconds to deactivate. Hearing a clicking sound or water flowing indicates the system’s normal operation while connected. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

For cleaning, avoid using harsh chemicals. Instead, clean with a damp cloth. The Custom TM cover can be removed for easier access. Ensure that the system is turned off before cleaning.

Properly storing food items on the Custom TM shelves helps maintain freshness. The shelves allow for easy access and should be positioned to avoid overcrowding, which can impede air circulation. 

### General Care and Sound Management

The system may produce typical operational noises, such as hissing during ice activation or the sound of water flowing. These indicate normal functioning and should not be concerning. 

### Water Filter Maintenance

The PureAdvantage™ filter should be replaced every six months for optimal performance and to ensure contaminants are effectively removed. Frequent checks on the water supply and overall system operation are encouraged to maintain functionality.

In summary, effective use and maintenance of the Wave-Touch™ and Custom TM systems depend on proper handling, timely cleaning, and regular evaluations to ensure enhanced longevity and efficiency.

The Water and TM Cartridge should produce audible clicks when engaged. Turn on the front housing by pressing the release button, while ensuring the water supply is previously connected. Maintain the button press for three seconds. It is recommended to replace the Water Cartridge every six months when the indicator light activates. For initial installation, refer to information from www.electroluxappliances.com or the retailer where the product was purchased.

To preserve the unit's appearance and prevent buildup of residues, clean it regularly using non-abrasive cleaners. Avoid using harsh cleaners like bleach or scouring pads as they may damage the unit's surfaces, which can void the warranty. For proper functioning, any cleaning of internal components should be done with caution, ensuring the unit is turned off and disconnected from power.

If you plan to be away for extended periods, turn off the cooling section to preserve food. For short vacations, make sure to unplug perishable items and turn off cooling. Always clean the internal and external surfaces to reduce buildup.

LED lights indicate the status of the fresh food compartment. For maintenance, carefully remove the light cover if necessary, ensuring the LED light is oriented correctly and facing outward. Always follow safety precautions when handling electrical components.

For troubleshooting issues related to the light not illuminating or operational inefficiencies, consult the common correction sections for guidance. Ensure proper seating of the water supply and that filters are replaced in accordance with usage. Regularly inspect food storage practices to avoid overcrowding, which can affect cooling efficiency.

Address any excessive moisture or frost buildup promptly, following recommended cleaning and maintenance practices to ensure the longevity of the appliance. If problems persist, refer to customer support or service professionals for further assistance.
