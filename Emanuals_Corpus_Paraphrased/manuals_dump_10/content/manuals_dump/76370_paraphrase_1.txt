The process involves downloading memory data from various sources, which contributes to efficient operation and enhances G-force performance. This is accomplished through strategic mounting options that provide both high protection and capacity for extraction. The units are designed to operate on 230/400V electricity, and they support typical heating conditions of 60°C (3G01) for both hot and cold water, as well as steam ranging from 15°C to 65°C. They are ISO certified and meet IP 24D standards.

Models W475S, W485S, and W4105S are specifically designed for professional laundry applications, capable of connectivity options including 230V 1AC, 230V 3AC, 208-240V 3AC, 240V 1AC, and 400-415V 3N AC for steam and water applications. Additional technical details include sound levels compliant with IEC standards and features for effective heating, while specifications are subject to change.
