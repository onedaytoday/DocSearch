**USING THE TELESCOPIC RUNNERS** 

Ensure the shelves are positioned correctly and securely within the cavity. 

**GRILL PAN USAGE** 

Ensure the grill pan and its handle are securely attached. Position food correctly for optimal cooking results.

**HINTS AND TIPS** 

For best results, allow food to come to room temperature and prepare it according to recommended thicknesses for even cooking. Follow the guidance for using high settings effectively.

**Preheating:** Ensure the meat or food is properly positioned for cooking. Adjust the food to be centered directly beneath the heating element as indicated in the Service Force Grilling Chart. Cooking times will vary by item, such as toast, rashers, or chops.

**Using the Second Oven:** The second oven is designed for baking tasks and should be preheated at the top and bottom. Ideal cooking temperatures for items—like cakes—are around 100°C. Remember to switch off any safety features when necessary.

**Important Notes:** Cooking should start once the set temperature is reached, indicated by the operational signals. The internal light confirms that it’s functioning correctly. Ensure that dishes are placed correctly, with the shelf clear for optimal heat distribution. Adjustments to dish placements may be made for even cooking.

**Hints and Tips:** Positioning your oven shelves properly (counting from the bottom up) is crucial, and dishes should allow for heat circulation. Avoid overcrowding your oven. Choose smooth cookware to ensure better heat conduction and even browning.

**Cooking Chart for the Second Oven:** Follow the specific shelf positions and temperatures for various foods, ensuring everything is properly placed for batch baking.

**Main Fan Oven:** Preheating is essential for achieving the desired cooking temperatures. Without preheating, it’s challenging to reach the recommended high temperatures efficiently. Adjust your cooking temperatures downward by about 20-25°C as needed.

**Using the Conventional Oven:** This allows for different cooking styles and requires monitoring for browning and doneness. Ensure proper placement for maximum efficiency.

**Oven Cooking Chart:** Follow the specific guidelines for each type of food and cooking method, noting any deviations in temperatures and times.

**Roasting Chart:** Adhere strictly to recommended cooking times and temperatures to facilitate proper roasting.

**Pizza Function:** Designed for cooking pizzas, this function requires proper shelf placement of food directly on the oven rack to achieve optimal results.

**SpeedCook Function:** Allows for quicker cooking without preheating, though adjustments might lead to faster results.

**Thermal Grilling:** Combines top-down heat for even cooking, particularly effective for browning and heating through dishes. Ensure food is appropriately spaced.

For accurate results, always follow the recommended charts for temperatures and cooking times based on the type of food and desired doneness.

### Defrosting

This function allows for defrosting food without applying heat, using the ambient temperature around the food. It is particularly useful for items that have ice or frost on them. 

**Using the Defrost Feature**: 
- The function operates automatically, turning on and off as needed, with a light indicator. 
- Considerations: The defrosting environment can affect the process. 
- To effectively thaw meat, it is recommended to use the defrost function, which is more efficient for thinly sliced, minced, or small cuts of meat. 

Defrosted food should be cooked immediately and not refrozen unless cooked. Follow safety guidelines to prevent bacteria growth during defrosting.

### Helpful Tips for Buying and Preparing Food
- Always adhere to food safety basics to minimize bacterial risks when buying, reheating, or defrosting food.
- Purchase products that are fresh and keep perishables insulated until they are ready to be used. Ensure cooked food is stored correctly; it should never remain at room temperature for extended periods.
- Use a meat thermometer to confirm that meat reaches the proper internal temperature during cooking.

### Care and Cleaning
