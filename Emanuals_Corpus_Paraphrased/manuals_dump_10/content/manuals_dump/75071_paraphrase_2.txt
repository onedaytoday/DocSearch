### Safety and Usage Guidelines

To minimize the risk of burns, electric shock, and fire, it is crucial to read all instructions before operating the appliance. Follow the precautions to prevent excessive exposure to microwave energy. Ensure the appliance is properly grounded by adhering to the grounding instructions provided. Use only recommended products, such as specifically designed containers for heating and cooking food.

Do not heat tightly sealed containers, as they may lead to pressure build-up and potential hazards. When microwaving, be aware that liquids can become extremely hot and may erupt suddenly when disturbed, such as when a utensil is inserted.

For optimal heating, use vessels that are wide-mouthed and straight-sided. Be cautious when reheating foods; open the microwave door carefully, and monitor to avoid overcooking. It's advisable to rearrange food for even cooking and cover items to prevent splatters while promoting uniform heating.

### Children’s Safety

Keep children under the age of 12 supervised when using the microwave. Teach them safe cooking practices and the appropriate use of potholders and coverings.

### Utensils and Covers

Use only microwave-safe cookware, ensuring to follow the recommendations for materials and heating instructions. Avoid metal containers or items that are not microwave-safe, and follow guidelines for the appropriate use of covers.

### Speed and Convection Cooking

To prevent burns, ensure the turntable is preheated and observe the recommended cooking temperatures for various food types. Always use a food thermometer to check that meat and poultry reach safe internal temperatures.

### Appliance Maintenance

Keep the interior of the microwave clean and free from food debris, which can overheat and catch fire. Ensure the turntable moves freely and is properly positioned.

### Clock and Timer Operation

To set the clock, follow the outlined procedure and ensure the appliance is reset if there are power interruptions. If an error appears, use the STOP/CLEAR function to reset.

By following these guidelines closely, you can ensure safe and effective operation of your microwave appliance.

**Speed Cooking Overview:**

To prevent burns when using the microwave, ensure the cooking cavity is adequately thick and select high cooking temperatures for foods, specifically when preheating the oven to 450°F. Once preheating is complete, the food will emit a sound to indicate it's ready to cook. 

For high cooking methods, food can be cooked without preheating, but preheating is typically recommended. When roasting meat or other items at 300°F, it's also advisable to preheat. The microwave can cook food effectively without the usual preheating requirement by using the specified power levels. 

**Convection Cooking:**

Convection cooking provides consistent heating throughout the cavity, allowing food to cook evenly at 325°F. Preheating can either be done separately or as part of the cooking process. Choose the convection setting and adjust or set a cooking temperature of 350°F if needed. 

To preheat, follow the prompts displayed on the screen until the signal indicates that it has reached the desired temperature.

**Cooking Time and Power Levels:**

When adjusting cooking times, start by utilizing the recommended power levels specified in the manual or recipe guide. The microwave includes various power levels for different types of food including meats, casseroles, and desserts, which must be adhered to for optimal results.
