To operate the appliance, use the selection knob to navigate through options such as COTTONS, DELICATES, WOOLLENS, and various wash cycles including EXTRA PREWASH and SUPER RINSE. Adjust the settings for spin reduction or quick wash by pressing the ON/OFF button to activate; the indicator light will illuminate accordingly. If "easy-cares" is selected, the machine will automatically adjust the cycle settings. It's important to turn off the machine using the ON/OFF button when necessary.

**Warning:** Select appropriate cycles for easy-care fabrics and ensure hoses are securely connected. Activate the desired cycle by choosing the corresponding button based on the load type, such as heavy whites or colors, or quick wash for lighter fabrics. If a blockage is suspected in the hose, consult the troubleshooting guide.

Periodic cleaning of the appliance is recommended. To clean the lint filter and any clogs, follow appropriate procedures to access and clean these areas. Ensure the appliance is switched off and unplugged during cleaning operations. 

For draining water or addressing clogs, select the PUMP OUT function and switch off the machine post-drainage. If temperatures drop below freezing, protect hoses from damage. 

In case of operational anomalies, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact AEG Service Force. Be sure to provide details of the issue, the model number, and previous maintenance experiences. 

The appliance is covered under warranty for specific periods against manufacturing defects, but it will not cover issues arising from misuse or unauthorized repairs.

When moving the appliance, follow local safety regulations and ensure proper installation. Consult the instructions provided for unpacking and setting up the unit, ensuring all packing materials are removed before use.

This revision maintains the original intent while presenting the information clearly and cohesively.

Position the unit so that it effectively applies the coating while avoiding any impediments. Ensure the hoses are accessible and properly connected to prevent breakdowns. Secure the setup using screws on at least the thick beams. If securing the corners, ensure the water supply lines are correctly routed. There should be appropriate connections and the height of the hoses relative to the unit must be maintained properly.

The hoses must be positioned correctly to ensure efficient water supply from the heater. Verify that the internal diameter of the hose is consistent with specifications and that it extends adequately to allow for optimal flow. The upright portion should be properly aligned to prevent any obstructions.

Connect the hoses to the water system, ensuring compliance with local authority regulations. This appliance must be earthed. Any connections must be made securely and components fitted properly. 

For electrical wiring, make sure to connect the colored wires to the corresponding terminals: green/yellow for earth, blue for neutral, and brown for live. Use a moulded plug that complies with BS1363A and appropriate safety standards. The wiring should follow regulations, and ensure that the switch is connected correctly to the power supply.
