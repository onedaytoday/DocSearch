**Counters Description and Features**

The counters are designed with built-in features that utilize AISI RCSN3M34 stainless steel for the construction of both the front and top. They are insulated using high-density expanded material to ensure optimal temperature maintenance. The self-closing mechanism is CFC and HCFC-free, adhering to international standards for safety and performance.

The counters facilitate easy cleaning thanks to their rounded internal corners. Forced cooling technology ensures uniform distribution of cold air, which helps maintain food quality effectively, even in high ambient temperatures (up to +43Â°C).
