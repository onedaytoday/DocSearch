### USB and PC Connections

To connect your device, use the USB to PC connection or the SD to PC option, along with the Age Mate software available on the CD-ROM (refer to page 98). To operate the SD switch, toggle it ON/OFF as indicated. Utilize the outputs: [RGB OUT] and [DVI OUT], or [VIDEO OUT]. Note that with the [VIDEO OUT], the RESOLUTION/VIDEO switch must be set to [VIDEO] to receive input from [RGB OUT] or [DVI OUT]. The [PC] input will be active whenever [RGB OUT] is selected.

For remote operation, ensure the cover is positioned correctly, and check the battery polarity for the AAA batteries (refer to page 104). The device will function properly only after at least one trial operation.

**Important Warning**: Keep batteries away from children, and if ingested, seek medical attention immediately.

### Operations and Features

To power the device ON/OFF, use the designated switch. Highlight functions using the directional controls, such as ZOOM or PIP, while the device is in operation (page 119). You can switch to RGB IN when both PC and other operations are connected.

Adjust brightness using the BRIGHTNESS function, and utilize OSD (On-Screen Display) characters for easier navigation (see page 113). To access the OSD, press the [MENU] button located on the front panel, and navigate through the menu using the directional buttons.

### Feature Adjustments

The following options are available for adjustment: 

- **Brightness**: Modify the brightness level for optimal visibility.
- **AF (Auto Focus)**: Use One-shot focusing for accurate distance measurement. Manual adjustments can be made by pressing [AF] to select different focus levels.

### Input Options

For video inputs, select between NTSC and PAL formats based on your regional specifications. Connect the device to a PC using USB, ensuring that the PC is powered OFF before making connections. The device supports various resolutions, including SXGA, via DVI and RGB connections.

### Setting Up the Device

Begin setup by connecting the AC adapter and USB. Ensure the RGB and DVI outputs are linked correctly to external displays. When connecting to video sources, utilize the appropriate cables for proper functionality.

For optimal light capture, position the head as indicated. When ready to operate, ensure all connections are secure and power is switched ON.

### Storing and Maintenance

When storing, follow the guidelines for proper handling of the device. Power OFF the device and store it in a dry place to avoid malfunctions. Always ensure that settings are reverted to factory specifications if needed before storage.

### Operational Procedure

When ready to use, align the device correctly and ensure even light coverage. Execute test captures to confirm operation before making adjustments to brightness or focusing options. Use the [AF] button to initiate the autofocus function for precise shots, then make any further adjustments as needed.

Keep this operational guide handy for troubleshooting or adjustment queries.

### SD Card Usage and Troubleshooting Guide

When using a commercially available SD card, be aware that malfunctions may occur if the card is not properly inserted or if power is lost while it is in operation. To prevent damage, always ensure the SD card is correctly seated and the device is powered on while in use.

The SD card can come in various capacities, such as 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, and SDHC cards up to 4GB. Supported display resolutions include SXGA, WXGA, and XGA. If a malfunction occurs, avoid turning off the device abruptly, as this may disrupt the SD card's normal functioning.

### Operation Procedures

1. **Basic Operations**: 
   - Use the menu to initiate operations. If an option is not accessible, it may be due to the SD card being write-protected. When recording, avoid switching between cards to minimize the risk of malfunction.

2. **Menu Access**: 
   - To format the SD card, navigate through the OSD by pressing the [MENU] button. Select the [SD] option and then choose [Format]. 

3. **Connecting to PC**:
   - Connect the SD card to a PC via USB. Ensure the PC meets system requirements, such as having a compatible OS (e.g., Windows SP4 or SP2). If any issues arise during this connection, ensure that the SD card is properly locked or unlocked as necessary.

4. **Handling USB Operations**:
   - Connect the USB to your computer and navigate the device's interface to access files. If using a specific application, refer to the instruction manual found on the accompanying CD-ROM. 

5. **Shooting Modes**:
   - Choose between shooting options by adjusting the zoom using the WIDE and TELE buttons. The context-sensitive OSD will guide you through these adjustments.

6. **Autofocus Functions**:
   - Autofocus (AF) areas can be selected via the OSD. One-shot AF can be activated for stationary subjects, while normal AF is suitable for moving objects.

7. **Brightness Adjustments**: 
   - Modify brightness levels by selecting the corresponding option in the OSD. This feature is beneficial in environments with varying light conditions.

8. **Reset to Factory Settings**: 
   - Restore factory settings by going to the relevant menu option in the OSD. This will reset all customizations.

9. **Color Calibration**:
   - Use the One-Push function to automatically adjust white balance, which can be fixed for consistent results.

By following these operational procedures and keeping an eye on troubleshooting guidelines, you can maintain effective usage of your SD card and associated devices.
