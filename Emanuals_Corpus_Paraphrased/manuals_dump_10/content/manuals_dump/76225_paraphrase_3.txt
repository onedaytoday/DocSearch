To initiate the washing machine, press the START/PAUSE button. The display will indicate the selected cycle and its current progress. You can adjust the cycle duration based on the fabric types and load size as per the provided instructions. 

To stop the cycle, press the START/PAUSE button again, then turn the machine off. If further actions like PUMP OUT, SPIN, or GENTLE SPIN are needed, select the appropriate option and press START/PAUSE. After completing a cycle, the END light will illuminate. If RINSE HOLD is selected, the START/PAUSE light will blink. 

For additional cycles such as SHORT or STAIN, select the desired option and press START/PAUSE again. In cases where RINSE HOLD is activated, pressing START/PAUSE will allow you to resume the machine. 

Once washing is complete, turn off the machine and disconnect it from the power supply. For routine maintenance, ensure you regularly clean filter and other components as specified in the user manual.

**Warning**: Always switch off the machine before cleaning or performing tasks like emptying the filter. If you need to remedy an issue indicated by error codes (like E10, E20, or E40), refer to the troubleshooting section to resolve any operational problems. 

For fabric types, follow the guidelines to use appropriate wash cycles—COTTONS/LINEN, EASY-CARES, WOOL, and DELICATES—with options for PRE-WASH, STAIN, or SHORT cycles as needed. 

In case of excessive foaming, check for clogs or issues with the water supply. Ensure the outlet and supply hoses are free of blockages and are properly connected. If clothes are crumpled or wet after washing, re-evaluate load size, cycle settings, and ensure hoses are correctly positioned.

For emergency emptying, carefully detach the drain hose, taking precautions against water overflow, and ensure the machine is powered off to prevent scalding. 

Follow these steps for optimal operation and safety protocols to maintain your washing machine's efficiency.
