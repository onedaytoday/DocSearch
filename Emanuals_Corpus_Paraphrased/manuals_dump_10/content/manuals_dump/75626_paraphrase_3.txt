### Wave-Touch™ System Overview

The Wave-Touch™ system is designed to facilitate ease of use and support the religious practices within the community. **Note:** While the Wave-Touch™ controls allow for ON and OFF settings, you need to press both buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. The system indicates when the high health settings are active for safety reasons. If the high setting is engaged, it may alert users with a sound. The high setting will automatically deactivate when the door closes, allowing for normal operation during the Sabbath or holidays.

To turn off the Custom™ function, please refer to the instructions. **Note:** If the lights indicate that the system is deactivated, it may require a recovery period before use. The built-in features ensure efficient operation, but if difficulties arise, a manual reset is necessary.

### Ice Water Supply

**Caution:** For optimal performance and to prevent malfunctions, ensure the water supply is properly connected. Press and hold the ON/OFF button for about three seconds to activate or deactivate it. The unit may take approximately three hours to cool down and produce ice effectively, with the capability to generate about 28 pounds of ice. 

When turning the ice function ON/OFF, you will notice LED indicators reflecting the current status. Remember to flush the system periodically, especially after modifications to prevent buildup from chemicals or residuals.

### Water Supply Management

For those connected to a water supply, hold the ON/OFF button for three seconds to shut it off. Be attentive to clicking sounds indicating operations are engaging or disengaging, especially when water is low. **Caution:** Ensure no harmful cleaners come into contact with internal parts. 

### Nutrition and Customization Features

The Custom™ shelves allow for better food organization. These are designed to enhance food freshness while making items easily accessible. It's essential to avoid overcrowding these shelves to maintain optimal cooling.

### General Operating Sounds

You might hear various operational sounds during normal use, indicating the system is functioning as intended. Some typical sounds include hissing during defrost cycles, water flow, and cooling operations. 

### Water Filtration System

The PureAdvantage™ filtration system is NSF International certified and designed to ensure clean water. It is advisable to replace filters regularly to maintain high performance.

In summary, please follow the operational guidelines for managing different functions and ensure regular maintenance for effective performance.

### Water System Setup and Maintenance Instructions

1. **Initial Setup**: Connect the water system. The unit should emit clicking sounds as it engages. Ensure the front cover is properly secured. Power on the unit and press the designated button while holding the housing steady. Maintain this position for three seconds to activate. 

2. **Water Filter Maintenance**: It's crucial to replace the TM FC-300 water cartridge every six months. The indicator light will prompt you when it's time for a change. Regularly check the housing and unpack as necessary. 

3. **General Cleaning Guidelines**: Use gentle cleaners; avoid abrasive or bleach-based products that could damage the appliance's finish. To ensure durability and maintain appearance, clean immediately to prevent buildup.

4. **Avoiding Damage**: Be careful not to use items that may scratch surfaces, and make sure to disconnect the unit from the power source before cleaning. If cooling needs to be turned off, do so via the On/Off section.

5. **LED Light Maintenance**: Both the fresh food and other compartments are equipped with LED lights that may require periodic cleaning. Ensure lights are properly aligned and directed towards the contents for optimal visibility. When cleaning, wear protective gear and ensure the unit is powered off. 

6. **Troubleshooting**: If the LED lights aren't functioning, check for debris or connection issues. A flickering light may indicate an underlying issue, requiring investigation of the power supply and the integrity of the appliance itself.

7. **Common Issues**: Monitor the cooling efficiency and adjust settings as needed to avoid food spoilage. If food is excessively cold, a re-evaluation of the temperature settings is recommended. For ice production, ensure the water supply is consistent and unblocked. 

8. **Building Up Water Issues**: If moisture collects, inspect water connections and filters. Maintain cleanliness to prevent frost accumulation and ensure all vent areas are unobstructed.

9. **Regular Checks**: Regularly inspect food storage arrangements to maximize space and cooling efficiency, particularly during long periods of use or after power fluctuations.

By diligently following these guidelines, you can protect your investment, maintain performance, and ensure the longevity of your appliance.
