For an effective and accurate installation, please ensure you read these straightforward guidelines prior to beginning the process. Confirm that your installation meets all relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes, and consult these instructions as a reference. Common practice involves grounding electrical devices, such as telephones and computers, to water lines, either inside or outside the building. This grounding can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, causing electrolysis, which may produce a metallic taste or elevate the water's metal content. Such issues can be prevented by utilizing the correct materials as specified. Any drain fittings provided by the installer should be made of plastic to ensure electrical isolation between the fountain and the building’s plumbing system.

Refer to the specifications of the installation procedure for the EDFP217C, EDFP217RAC, EDFPVR217C, and EDFPVR217RAC models with FLEXI-GUARD Soft. Note that all servicing must be done by an authorized technician. It’s crucial that the installer connects the unplated copper tube to the cold water supply service stop (not supplied). The installation notes important water flow directions, recommended water supply locations, and waste outlet connections.

When setting the fountain, ensure that the wall is reinforced in specified areas. The fountain should be placed according to the rough-in dimensions shown or denoted in relevant industry standards (ANSI A117.0). Ensure that water supply lines are secured through the back service points, and utilities should be turned off and properly checked prior to installation.

To avoid damage, do not solder tubes that are inserted into the strainer, as this may harm the O-rings. The products listed must operate with a water supply pressure of less than the specified maximum; if pressures exceed safe levels outlined, warranty coverage may be voided. Follow factory guidelines closely regarding stream height adjustments.

For installation troubleshooting and maintenance advice, refer to the specific installation instructions and troubleshooting sections provided. Please be cautious not to over-tighten during the installation of replacement components, such as the bubbler and pedestal.
