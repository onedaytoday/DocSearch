The system features coolers operating between -2 to +8°C, constructed with thick, pre-insulated walls and built-in components. These four coolers incorporate pre-charged cooling systems and are designed with high-performance standards. They utilize pre-painted polyurethane insulation and are free of CFCs and HCFCs. The rounded corners enhance safety and functionality. The fast-fit design allows for the assembly of high-quality, airtight PVC components. The system can accommodate ambient temperatures up to +43°C and utilizes R404A refrigerant with options for high and low temperature applications.

Defrosting is facilitated through an integrated heated system to minimize frost accumulation, complemented by internal lighting rated at IP54. Key features include an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting switch, operational thermostat, and a right-hinged door equipped with smooth cam-lift action hinges, ensuring a tight seal and high insulation efficiency to reduce energy consumption. Compliance with HACCP standards is assured, along with the provision of various accessories.
