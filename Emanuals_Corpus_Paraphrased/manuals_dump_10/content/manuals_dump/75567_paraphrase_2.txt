### Cooking Guidelines and Tips

**Food Preparation and Cooking:**  
Ensure food is cooked evenly and thoroughly. Adjust cooking time based on the type and thickness of the food. For optimal results, food should be placed on a suitable shelf height to allow adequate airflow and even browning.

**Using the Top Oven:**  
The top oven is designed for baking cakes and other items. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature, typically between 100°C and 150°C. It is important to monitor cooking progress, as temperatures will naturally fluctuate. For proper placement, shelves should be positioned straight and securely against the back.

### Cooking Tips
- Roasts are typically best cooked in the top oven, where heat surrounds the food to enhance cooking efficiency and reduce cleanup.
- Place food centrally on the shelf, ensuring adequate space around it for even cooking.
- Avoid direct contact with the heating elements, which can lead to over-browning.

**Main Fan Oven Features:**  
The main fan oven circulates hot air around the food, ensuring even cooking results. Preheating is recommended, typically to around 160°C-180°C, depending on the dish.

**Batch Baking:**  
For batch baking, food should be arranged to allow for optimal airflow. When cooking similar types of food together, ensure they are spaced adequately to minimize cooking time.

### Oven Cooking Chart
Utilize the cooking chart provided to determine appropriate shelf positions and temperatures for various food types, including pastry, meats, and baked goods.

**Roasting Chart:**
Monitor internal temperatures for meats and poultry to ensure they are cooked thoroughly. Cooking times may vary based on personal preference.

### Defrosting Feature  
Use the defrost function judiciously for frozen foods, especially those like cakes that may have delicate toppings. Ensure meat is fully thawed before cooking.

### Care and Maintenance
- Allow the unit to cool down before disconnecting from power.
- Use appropriate cleaning agents that are specifically recommended for the appliance. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach that can damage finishes.
- Follow specific guidelines for cleaning different components, including the hotplate and oven surfaces.

**Cleaning Recommendations:**
- Avoid abrasive materials or chemicals for surfaces that could scratch or discolor.
- Any removable parts should be cleaned safely, and when cleaning the inner oven and grill compartments, follow manufacturer guidelines.

**Door Glass Cleaning:**  
For cleaning between the outer and inner panes of oven glass, carefully detach the outer glass panel, taking care not to damage any fittings. 

Maintain the appliance according to these recommendations to ensure optimal performance and longevity.

### REPLACING THE OUTER GLASS

To replace the outer glass, hold the top of the door with one hand while aligning the screw locations with the other hand. Carefully tighten the screws using a screwdriver, ensuring the outer glass is secured properly. Avoid chipping or scratching the glass, as this can lead to shattering. For further assistance, please contact Service Force.

### CLEANING THE INNER GLASS DOOR PANELS

Use a soft cloth along with a suitable cleaning agent. If heavily soiled, a product like Brite may be effective. 

### REPLACING THE OVEN LIGHT BULB

The oven uses a 300C Screw type bulb. **Caution:** Disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply before replacing the bulb. Remove the shelves to access the light assembly. Unscrew the cover by turning it counter-clockwise, and then replace the bulb by turning it clockwise. Reassemble and reconnect the electricity supply as needed.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

If issues arise, check the following: 
- Ensure the appliance is properly wired and switched on.
- Verify that the door closes properly.
- Check the temperature settings; they should not be excessively high or low, ideally around 10°C as per operational guidelines.
- If the cooling system doesn’t function, or if there are issues with cooking or lighting, contact Service Force.
