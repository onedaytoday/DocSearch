**Cooking Tips**

1. **Thawing and Heating**: Food may require shorter cooking times in the microwave compared to conventional cooking. Adjust cooking times based on the amount of food—typically, twice the amount of food takes nearly double the time, while half the amount requires half the time.

2. **Food Placement**: Arrange food items evenly in the microwave for uniform cooking. Avoid overcrowding, which may lead to uneven results.

3. **Covering Food**: Use microwave-safe lids or covers to retain moisture and heat during cooking. Certain foods may need turning mid-cycle for even heating.

### AG-21+22D-UK ENGLISH Overview of Cooking and Defrosting Procedures

**Browning and Heating**  
Browning food enhances its visual appeal and flavor through agents like Worcestershire sauce or onion.
