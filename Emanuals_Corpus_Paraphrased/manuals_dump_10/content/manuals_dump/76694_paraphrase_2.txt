For assistance with installation, please refer to the following instructions. Begin by using the included screws to attach the top tension elbow to the wall. Ensure that both corners are assembled correctly. The provided screws must be used to secure the four corners together as shown. 

When mounting the Black AcousticPro1080, position the plates so that they face the back. This setup minimizes light reflection and enhances the acoustic properties of the screen. Ensure that the plates are neatly applied and that no excess material is present. Follow these guidelines for proper plate attachment.

The installation process allows for flexibility, enabling precise centering on the wall. It is essential to check for obstructions like switches or outlets and to confirm that the mounting anchors are secure and capable of supporting the weight of the screen. 

For maintenance, use a clean cloth, avoiding harsh chemicals or direct contact with cleaners. The screenâ€™s warranty covers workmanship for a specified period post-purchase, including additional provisions for certain government or military purchases.
