Sure! Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a clear and technical manner:

Utilize the BAKING, FAN COOKING, or CONVENTIONAL functions as needed. For light baking and fan cooking, adjust the shelf positioning using baking or conventional settings. When placing cakes on different shelves, instructions indicate that shelf placement should be counted from the top. 

For optimal results, ensure that cakes are thoroughly cooked when using the baking or conventional methods, as the heat might increase only slightly during preheating with the conventional option. If the cooking height is adjusted, consider the information provided to avoid overcooking. 

For baking different types of cakes such as Christmas cake, apple cakes, or meringues, preheat accordingly and select higher shelf positions as specified. Ensure cakes are cooked through by monitoring their texture, and adjust cooking times if necessary.

When roasting, use the FAN COOKING, ROTITHERM, or CONVENTIONAL functions, ensuring equipment is heat-resistant. Choose an appropriate roasting sheet for meat, keeping in mind that some roasts may require direct placement on the shelf. 

The duration and temperature for cooking meats should follow the guidelines for the chosen method. Adjust the heat and cooking duration to prevent burning and ensure thorough cooking.

For specific meat dishes, follow the recommendations for preheating and optimal shelf position. The instructions vary based on the type of meat or dish being prepared.

When using functions like the SINGLE GRILL or DUAL GRILL, it’s essential to monitor the cooking process closely, especially when multiple items are cooked on the same shelf.

For drying fruits or herbs, select the FAN COOKING function and maintain the recommended temperature. Use appropriate containers and monitor the drying process as outlined.

For defrosting, choose the DEFROST function, and place the food on a suitable plate to allow for even thawing, covering as needed. Use the provided Defrosting Table for guidance on various foods.

Regarding preserving, utilize the BOTTOM HEAT function for items in screw-top jars, ensuring they are sealed properly. Switch the heat off as directed after the recommended cooking duration.

When cleaning the appliance, follow safety warnings and use suitable cleaning materials. The appliance should be off and cool before starting the cleaning process. Specific instructions address how to handle shelves and other removable parts for thorough cleaning.

If utilizing the PYROLUXE cleaning function, watch for the COOK TIME indicator and follow the prompts to complete the cycle effectively, ensuring thorough cleaning of the interiors and surfaces.
