The following text emphasizes the importance of grounding the device and ensuring proper electrical connections. The appliance must be properly earthed (grounded) and connected to the power supply as indicated on the rating plate located on the back cover. The connections should adhere to the ASTA (BS) standards. In case of faulty wiring, connections must be color-coded as follows: the earth wire with 'E' should be green/yellow, the neutral wire with 'N' is blue, and the live wire with 'L' is red. Any stray or outer sheath wires must also comply with ASTA (BS) regulations to prevent serious electrical shocks.

To ensure safety, a technician should check the switch rated higher than C. This appliance typically uses H05RR-F wiring. Certain checks are outlined, such as verifying earth continuity (A), insulation (B), and polarity (C). For appliances that are electrically disconnected, appropriate readings are crucial. If any issues are found during inspections, such as signs of burning or arcing, they must be rectified immediately.

During commissioning, proceed as follows: set the controls from MAX to MIN and check the operation of the ignitor. If problems persist, troubleshoot the injector supply, adjusting as needed. For converting from natural gas to LPG, ensure adjustments are done meticulously, particularly with the injectors, so the gas rate aligns with the specified settings. 

Remember to avoid using unsuitable cleaning products and to always adhere to applicable safety standards when servicing or adjusting the device.
