The design of kitchen environments aims to enhance user experience while cooking. Key aspects include effective ventilation and lighting that create an inviting atmosphere. The integration of three guiding principles—INSIGHT, INSPIRE, and INTUITION—focuses on creating a user-friendly environment that allows for discreet functionality. 

Aesthetic elements, such as smart lighting, make food more visually appealing and facilitate easy selection while removing airborne grease efficiently. The efficiency of the system is complemented by appropriate ducting, which optimizes grease extraction during cooking.
