**READ AND SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS**

These operating instructions are essential for the correct usage of your refrigerator. While they aim to address every scenario, not all situations may be covered. It is crucial to read all instructions prior to using the refrigerator, especially right after unpacking. Ensure children are kept away from packaging materials that could cause suffocation, such as plastic sheets and bags. Keep these items stored securely.

**FOR YOUR SAFETY**  
Adhere to the following electrical guidelines to ensure proper operation. This refrigerator requires a three-prong grounding outlet to prevent electric shock. If there are any issues affecting its performance, disconnect the power before servicing. Prevent accidental damage to the electrical cord and keep it straight to avoid pinching, which could lead to hazards.

Choose a level and well-ventilated location that meets the specified temperature range. Allow a minimum distance around the refrigerator for air circulation after installation. Be mindful that heat sources can affect its efficiency, so adequate spacing is crucial for optimal functioning.

**ENERGY SAVING TIPS**  
Keep the refrigerator away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Do not overcrowd it with items, as proper air circulation is vital for efficient cooling.
