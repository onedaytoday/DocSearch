Ensure that the cake is appropriately leveled before baking. If the cake rises excessively, adjust the temperature or cooking time as needed. Grease the baking tray properly to distribute heat evenly. Preheat the oven using the Convection function and set it on Shelf C for various foods, including gratins and pre-cooked meals.

For cooking chips or other items, use the Convection heating settings. Monitor the thickness of the meat and adjust cooking times accordingly.
