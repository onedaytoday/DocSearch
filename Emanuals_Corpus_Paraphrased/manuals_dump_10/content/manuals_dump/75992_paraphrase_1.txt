### Grill Shelf
The grill shelf consists of three levels, counted from the top. The shelf should be positioned straight against the back wall. If installed correctly, it will function optimally. Ensure that the grill pan and handle are adjusted slightly upwards for proper placement. When aligning the shelf, all food should point directly toward the front for optimal cooking.

### Hints and Tips
For uniform cooking, adjust the distance food is placed on the grill, allowing for varying thicknesses. It’s important to turn food as needed during cooking for even results. Preheat the grill or oven as instructions dictate, and make sure not to overcrowd the plates during the cooking process.

### Grilling Chart

### Slowcook Feature
This feature allows for longer cooking durations, ideal for cheaper cuts of meat. Follow initial steps for setup.

### Cooking Care and Cleaning
Ensure the cooker remains clean to prevent safety hazards. Allow it to cool down properly before cleaning and switch off the electricity.

### Cleaning Materials
Using the appropriate cleaning products is crucial. Avoid abrasives and bleach to preserve finishes.

### Cleaning Outer and Inner Glass Panels
Utilize household cleansers that are non-abrasive. For the outer glass, ensure proper removal and cleaning techniques are followed.

### Final Reminders
If the glass becomes damaged, consult a service professional for repairs to avoid shattering hazards.

### Replacing the Outer Door Glass

To replace the outer door glass, use one hand to position the glass correctly. Align the screw holes at the top of the door and use your other hand to hold the screws with washers. Tighten the screws using a screwdriver to ensure a secure closure. **Important:** Do not operate the door without ensuring it's properly secured.

### Cleaning the Inner Glass Door

For cleaning the inner glass door, use a recommended cleaner or a soft cloth. Avoid abrasive materials as they may damage the surface. 

### Cleaning the Ovens

The top and sides of the oven are coated with a special Stayclean finish, which aids in self-cleaning. However, the back of the oven should be cleaned manually, as it's not treated with the Stayclean finish. Avoid using harsh cleaners as they may damage the surface.

### Removing Wirework Runners

To remove wirework runners, unhook the shelves from the cavity and lift them out. Clean the shelves and wirework with a suitable cleaner. If they are heavily soiled, they may require soaking in a dishwasher-safe cleaning solution.

### Care for Stayclean Surfaces

The oven top and sides, which feature the Stayclean finish, should be cleaned manually. If food splatters occur, use the Stayclean function to make cleaning easier.

### Oven Cleaning Cycle

To activate the oven cleaning cycle, switch it on for a specified time to allow the cleaning process to occur. Note that the cooling fan operates during the cleaning cycle and will turn off once the oven has cooled down. 

### Cooking Tips to Reduce Soil Build-Up

To minimize spills while cooking, especially when roasting, consider using a roasting tray or cover. This helps contain splatters that may come into contact with the Stayclean surfaces.

### Replacing an Oven Light Bulb

Before replacing the oven light bulb, disconnect the oven from the electricity supply. Use a suitable screwdriver to remove the light cover, change the bulb, and then reattach the cover before reconnecting the power.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an issue with the cooker, check the electricity supply and ensure that it is plugged in. Confirm that the cooling fan is operational and that the door is properly closed. Refer to the manual for troubleshooting guidance.
