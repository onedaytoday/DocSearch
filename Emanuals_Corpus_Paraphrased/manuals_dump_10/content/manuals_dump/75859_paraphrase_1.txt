**Warnings**  
To avoid electrical shocks or fire, keep the appliance free from obstructions. Use only approved cables and avoid overextending them. Unplug the unit before performing maintenance. Avoid placing the appliance near heat sources and keep it away from direct sunlight. 

**Usage Instructions**  
Ensure that food is stored as specified to maintain safety and quality. Periodically check food conditions and adhere to defrosting guidelines. Clean the appliance regularly and ensure proper ventilation to enhance its efficiency. If you encounter ice buildup, follow defrosting protocols detailed below.

### First Use and Cleaning  
For initial use, unpack the appliance and allow it to stabilize for at least four hours before use. Ensure it's connected safely and do not overload it, as this can affect performance. 

### Daily Operations  
When storing food, keep in mind the maximum recommended quantities to ensure optimal cooling. Use the designated shelves wisely and ensure that food items are covered securely to prevent spoilage. 

### Care and Maintenance  
Regular cleaning is vital for the appliance's proper functioning. Clean the interior and exterior surfaces with suitable cleaning products. Do not use harsh chemicals, as they may damage the appliance.

### Defrosting  
To defrost, switch off the appliance and remove any food items. Allow the frost to melt naturally. If frost reaches a thickness of about 5mm, perform the defrosting procedure as needed. 

### Troubleshooting  
If you experience issues such as improper closure, excess frost, or water leakage, consult the troubleshooting section. Correct operation can often resolve these problems.  

### Technical Data  
Refer to technical specifications for appliance dimensions and operational parameters. For any service needs, contact authorized technicians only.

The technical specifications specify installation details and the operational ratings at different temperature ranges: SN from +10°C to +32°C, ST from +16°C to +38°C, and T from +16°C to +43°C. Ensure proper earthing of the device, as indicated. Wires are color-coded as follows: Earth - Brown; Neutral - Blue; Live - Red. It's crucial to avoid damage to the outer sheath of the wires.

For electrical supply, consult the rating provided on the device. Caution: Incorrect connections can lead to electrical shock; connections must be made securely. Align the components according to the specified arrows in the installation guide and ensure tight fitment with screws.

Verify the clearance between the cover and the unit, ensuring proper assembly. Attach the covers sequentially as described, including lateral adjustments where required. 

For environmental considerations, dispose of the unit responsibly, treating it as household waste. Recycling information and further assistance are available at the website or from the retailer. Ensure all screws are tightened for optimal performance and safety.
