### Supply/System Cooling Overview

The supply/system cooling integrates power and cooling functionalities and is positioned within the system. It features a dual-blower cooling mechanism and is power-factor-corrected. Each cooling unit operates offline and has an on/off switch. The power units (DAE2) interface with one another and include LCC switches for managing their operation and any fault conditions associated with other Field Replaceable Units (FRUs). 

The cooling system provides redundancy through its dual blowers; if one blower fails, the other continues to operate, ensuring the power/cooling units remain functional. Each power/cooling unit is indicated by three status LEDs, with specific meanings associated with each light: the rightmost LED indicates unit status, while the others provide status updates on power and cooling operations.

### DAE2 Supply/System Cooling Reference Materials

This section discusses the DAE2's operation and specifications, including RAID functionalities and cabling standards. In particular, it covers electrical ratings, input cooling requirements, and the type of interfaces utilized (Fiber Channel or ATA). Proper cabling is essential, as it balances the load across the system. The DAE2 incorporates shielded twin-axial cabling to meet performance requirements.

### Installation and Grounding Considerations

When connecting to the DAE2, ensure proper grounding and adhere to the manufacturerâ€™s guidelines. Any connections should maintain consistency within the LCC framework to prevent operational issues. Mounting considerations include using the appropriate hardware for optimal airflow and system cooling.

### Switch Configuration 

The DAE2 features an EA switch configuration for device identification. Properly configuring the switches is critical for operational integrity, especially in systems employing write-caching. Also, ensure that the initial setup of switches is meticulously followed to maintain system standards.

### LED Indicators and Monitoring

The LED indicators on the DAE2 provide crucial operational feedback. Each light serves a specific purpose: Active, Fault, or Idle indicators assist with real-time monitoring of operational status. When servicing, observe these indicators to diagnose issues quickly.

### Servicing Procedures

When servicing the DAE2, follow strict electrical discharge precautions to avoid damaging sensitive components. Use ESD wristbands and other protective gear as outlined. Familiarize yourself with emergency procedures for handling situations without ESD control.

### Safety Precautions for FRU Handling 

Before removing or replacing FRUs, ensure that the unit is de-energized, following all outlined safety protocols. Handle components with care to prevent static damage or physical harm. Each FRU should be returned to its designated location after service to maintain system integrity. 

**In summary, understanding the cooling supply, installation guidelines, switch configurations, LED indicators, and safe servicing practices for the DAE2 system is essential for optimal performance and reliability.**

**Cautionary Notes on ESD Handling and DAE2 Servicing**

Carefully handle all components by following the ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) guidelines. Use a properly fastened ESD wristband whenever servicing the DAE2 system. Avoid direct contact with the hardware and use handling techniques that comply with industry standards. Ensure that components are clean and free of static before proceeding with any operations.

**Unlocking the DAE2**

To unlock the DAE2, follow the procedural steps detailed in the documentation. Press the designated release mechanisms as shown to disengage the locking mechanism. Always ensure that the device is grounded and static-free before handling.

**Handling LUNs and Data Management**

Be cautious when dealing with LUNs (Logical Unit Numbers). Each LUN should be managed carefully, particularly when transferring data. Ensure that all information regarding LUNs is documented to prevent data loss during transitions between different states.

**LED Indicators and State Management**

If the active LED indicator remains lit, it signifies a successful lock state. If it turns off, consult the procedures to ensure correct system status. The LCC (Logical Controller Circuit) must be properly engaged to maintain optimal performance.

**Connecting and Disconnecting the LCC**

During LCC maintenance, ensure the ESD wristband is worn. Carefully release the LCC connections as per the outlined procedures, ensuring all components are in their designated positions.

**Power Supply and Cooling Management**

Handle power supply and cooling systems with care. Ensure that the relevant systems are turned off before servicing to avoid hazards. Follow the outlined cooling protocols to prevent overheating and ensure consistent operation.

**Technical Specifications Overview**

The technical specifications section details the performance metrics, power requirements (392 VA), and cooling features essential for operating the DAE2. This includes interfacing details and compliance with international standards such as UL, CE, and FCC Class A. 

Ensure that all installation and operational procedures meet the specified requirements for optimal functioning and safety.
