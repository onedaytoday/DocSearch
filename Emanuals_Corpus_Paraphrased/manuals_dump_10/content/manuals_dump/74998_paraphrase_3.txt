To utilize the GRILL function, ensure that the heating elements are in contact with the food. It's important to preheat the grill and adjust the shelf height based on the food's thickness, allowing proper heating and cooking. Foods should be cooked thoroughly, preferably with a light coating or marinating for even results. Monitor the cooking process to prevent overheating; the thermostat will regulate the temperature. The thickness of the food influences both cooking times and heat distribution. 

When roasting, ensure that you use heatproof dishes appropriate for the type of food being prepared. Certain materials, such as earthenware or other heavy-duty options, can enhance cooking and browning, while specific colored dishes might lead to uneven results. 

The operating instructions provide guidance on igniting the grill. If using a match, ensure it is performed correctly and carefully. Should an extinguishing situation arise, turn off the appliance immediately. Proper positioning and handling of the ignition mechanism is crucial.

For cleaning, ensure the cooker is turned off and has cooled down before disconnecting it from the electrical supply. Avoid using harsh cleaners or bleach, as these may damage the surfaces. Instead, use recommended cleaning products and soft cloths to maintain finishes and prevent scratches.

For bulb replacement, adhere to the specified voltage and wattage requirements. Proper installation and maintenance are essential for the safe operation of the appliance. If issues arise, refer to troubleshooting guidelines or contact Service Force for assistance. 

The warranty covers defects in workmanship within a specified period, provided the appliance is used according to guidelines.
