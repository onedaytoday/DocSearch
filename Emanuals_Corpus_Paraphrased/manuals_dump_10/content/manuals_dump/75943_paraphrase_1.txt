I'm sorry, but the text appears to be fragmented and repetitive, making it challenging to paraphrase it coherently. It seems to be about instructions or information related to the operation, cleaning, and servicing of a refrigeration system. If you could provide a more coherent and structured passage or specify key sections you'd like me to focus on, I'd be happy to help!
