### ICE AND WATER DISPENSER FEATURES

The ice and water dispenser allows users to select either ice cubes or crushed ice. To operate, press the designated button to activate the dispenser and ensure the water supply is completely functional. For detailed operational instructions, refer to the attached user manual. It's crucial that the water supply is properly connected, and the unit is flushed initially to remove any impurities.

The integrated system is designed to prevent chemical leakage and ensure proper functioning. The ice maker operates effectively when kept within recommended temperature ranges and is fed with fresh water. Regular checks and maintenance are necessary to prevent clogs or malfunctioning.

The On/Off switch should be activated appropriately — turn it on to commence operation, and ensure the ice and water systems are clear of obstructions. If issues arise, the water supply may need to be disconnected or the switch toggled off for troubleshooting. 

### ICE DISPENSER TIPS

Make sure the On/Off switch is set to "On" while the ice and water systems are in use. Occasionally, the ice may need to be separated to facilitate continuous dispensing. It’s also important to turn the water supply off if there are any persistent issues.

**IMPORTANT:** The unit typically comes factory-set, and users must ensure the water supply is connected directly to the main line to avoid operational issues. Be mindful of any unusual sounds during operation as they may indicate problems.

### CLEANING THE ICE DISPENSER

Before cleaning, switch off the On/Off button and empty the reservoir. Use a mild detergent or clear cleaner for cleaning surfaces. After cleaning, allow all components to dry completely before reactivating the dispenser.

**IMPORTANT:** Avoid using abrasive or harsh cleaning materials that could damage the unit. Follow manufacturer instructions for detailed cleaning guidelines.

### PURESOURCE™ ICE AND WATER SYSTEM

For units purchased with PureSource™ technology, ensure you're familiar with the setup and operation, which can be found on the right side of the fresh food compartment. The system is designed to be efficient, but may require occasional flushing as part of regular maintenance. If you have specific inquiries, consult the Service Force website at www.serviceforce.co.uk.

### FOOD STORAGE IDEAS

Store fresh food at temperatures between 0°C and 4°C, ensuring shelves aren't overcrowded to promote air circulation. Wrap meats securely to avoid cross-contamination, and use airtight containers for leftovers. Proper loading ensures efficient cooling and minimizes food waste.

### ENERGY SAVING IDEAS

Minimize direct sunlight exposure to the fridge and avoid using heat-producing appliances nearby. Ensure proper insulation is in place and avoid overcrowding the fridge to maintain efficiency.

### UNDERSTANDING NOISES

The unit may emit normal operational sounds, such as air flow or defrost heater noise. Here are common sounds and their explanations:
- Forced air movement
- Hissing from the defrost heater
- Cold air cycling

**IMPORTANT:** If you notice unfamiliar or concerning noises, address them promptly by checking the supply and controls.

### CLEANING GUIDELINES

Use only gentle, non-abrasive cleaners on your unit to avoid scratching surfaces. Clean areas like the interior, door seals, and light fixtures gently and in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines. For thorough cleaning, follow the specific recommendations in the user manual.

**Usage Guidelines for Replacing Light Bulbs**

Ensure the appliance is turned off and allow it to cool before handling. Use proper protective gear to avoid heat-related injuries if necessary. Unscrew the light cover based on the specific type of bulb being used.

**Short Vacations: Important Information**

Before leaving for vacation, disconnect the appliance from the power supply completely and allow its contents to cool down. Clean the interior thoroughly to prevent build-up and spoilage, especially for perishable items. For long absences (a month or more), turn off the appliance and clean it comprehensively.
