### Installation Instructions 

1. **Top Shelf Assembly**: Position the top shelf with the surface facing upwards, using the specified template for alignment. Reference point B is to be utilized during the process. The assembly must accommodate the charcoal filter correctly, ensuring it meets cooking clearance requirements as designated in the Clearance Heights section. 

2. **Fixing Components**: Utilize screws of length (X) for fixing components to the specified (Z) dimensions as illustrated. Prepare the assembly by ensuring all fixing screws are available. 

3. **Secure the Ducting**: When installing the ducting (D), insert it through the channel (X) and fasten securely using the provided round screws. Unscrew any existing screws from the assembly’s rear and the surrounding area to ensure proper fixture of ducting (F).

4. **Orientation Adjustments**: Position the assembly facing the rear and, if needed, adjust to either the left or right. First, secure screws (V1) to location (A), then follow with screws (B) for proper fixation. Unscrew four screws to access the surrounding frame. 

5. **Finalizing the Installation**: Once all connections are made, ensure that ducting remains tightly secured. Aligning the charcoal filter correctly allows for optimal airflow. Check all connections against the assembly to prevent any future issues with grease or residue.

6. **Final Checks**: Once assembly is complete, verify all screws are tightened and that the charcoal filter is installed correctly. Ensure that the installation is functioning as intended before concluding.
