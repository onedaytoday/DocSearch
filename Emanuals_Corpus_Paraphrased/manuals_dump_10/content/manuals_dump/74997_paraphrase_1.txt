**Cooking Instructions**

To effectively cook tougher cuts of meat, ensure they are heated properly to make the cooking process more economical. Begin by thawing meat thoroughly before cooking, and then reduce the heat for best results. Use a meat thermometer to confirm that the internal temperature has reached at least 75°C. For soups, start by bringing the liquid to a boil, and cover your pots with a lid or aluminum foil to trap heat.

When thickening meat dishes, consider using cornstarch, which helps retain moisture and prevents curdling. Reheat food carefully, ensuring it’s cooled before use, and remember to only reheat once.

**Cleaning Guidelines**

It's essential to keep all cooking appliances clean to prevent fire hazards. When cleaning, always refer to the operating instructions specific to your appliance. Utilize appropriate cleaning cloths and avoid harsh cleansers that may damage the finish. 

For cleaning the hotplate, scrub gently, particularly around the crowns, without using abrasive materials. Regular cleaning is crucial to maintaining the cooking surface; make sure to turn off the heat before cleaning.

Remove any burnt residues with care, and check screws securing the top of the appliance, tightening them as necessary. Always handle equipment safely, ensuring it is at room temperature before cleaning.

**Installation Information**

For installation, ensure compliance with local regulations and safety guidelines. Proper positioning of the cooker is vital to avoid fire hazards. Securely connect the appliance to the electrical supply, ensuring it’s earthed and protected as per standards.
