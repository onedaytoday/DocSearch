**Household Service Information and General Warranty**  
To minimize the risk of electric shock, follow appropriate guidelines. If servicing or reassembling the unit, ensure it is turned off and disconnected. Do not treat the device as a toy. When using the cleaner, keep it away from heated surfaces and avoid pulling the cord around sharp corners. Be diligent about protecting the cord from potential damage. 

**Important Safeguards**  
The instructions contained herein must be followed to prevent injury or electric shock. 

**Assembly Instructions**  
To assemble the cleaner, first connect the base correctly. The cornerstone of assembly involves securing the outer section with screws. Once the screws are hand-tightened, secure them fully with a screwdriver. The cord should be arranged around the coupling seat for ease of use. 

**Operational Guidelines**  
Adjust the height setting of the upright cleaner based on the type of carpet being cleaned. Switch the unit on or off as necessary. Be mindful of clothing or other items becoming entangled; ensure the unit is turned off when adjusting settings.

**Maintenance Guidelines**  
Regularly check for clogs that may impair performance. If the suction decreases, inspect for blockages and clean as needed. Avoid using automatic washers or dryers for parts. 

**Cleaning the Chamber**  
Ensure the chamber is accessible for easy cleaning and inspection. If grease accumulates on the cover, it should be cleared to maintain efficient operation. Use a wrench to assist with loosening and tightening screws as necessary. 

**Final Notes**  
If any components become worn or ineffective, replace them promptly to ensure optimal performance of the cleaner. Follow all safety protocols during maintenance and assembly.

**Headlight Caution:** Ensure the switch is turned off before handling the headlight. To release the top, use a screwdriver to lift the notches as shown.
