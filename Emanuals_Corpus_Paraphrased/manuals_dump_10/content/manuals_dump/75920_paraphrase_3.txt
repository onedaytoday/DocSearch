### OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

#### Controls 

Refer to Figure C for button operations for AC, DC, and LP gas modes. The indicator light flashes if there’s an issue. Ensure the thermostat is set correctly when using LP gas. 

#### Starting the Refrigerator 

For LP operation, turn the switch to "GAS", and listen for the ticking sound as it ignites. Once the indicator light is stable, adjust settings as needed.

#### Regulating the Temperature 

Allow a few hours to reach optimal operating temperatures. Adjust the thermostat according to the conditions.

### TRAVEL CATCH 

Ensure the door catches are secured during travel to maintain cooling efficiency and prevent food spoilage.

### FOOD STORAGE 

Store food items correctly to prevent spoilage. Be mindful that bottles may burst if frozen.

### ICE-MAKING 

For optimal ice production, adjust the cooling shelf accordingly.

### DEFROSTING 

Defrost when frost thickness exceeds specified limits. Avoid using sharp objects to remove frost and clean surfaces properly.

### CLEANING THE REFRIGERATOR 

Maintain cleanliness using a cloth and mild detergents, avoiding abrasive materials. Ensure the unit is powered off during cleaning.

### HEATING CABLE 

Use the heating cable in cold months to maintain food temperature. Ensure it’s off while the unit is charging.

### WINTER OPERATION 

When temperatures drop below 10°C, use winter covers to maintain efficient operation.

### TURNING OFF THE REFRIGERATOR 

Switch to "OFF", empty contents, and prepare for storage during winter months.

### TROUBLESHOOTING 

If issues arise, follow "Starting the Refrigerator" instructions to diagnose potential problems. Ensure power sources are connected and functioning.

### MAINTENANCE 

Service should only be performed by qualified technicians. Regular LP gas checks are recommended.

### SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS 

Refer to the service directory for authorized service centers and spare parts.

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

#### Repositioning the Hinges 

For hinge repositioning, please follow detailed instructions to ensure proper alignment and door operation.

### INSTALLATION/BUILDING-IN 

Ensure the refrigerator is adequately ventilated and oriented correctly for optimal performance. Follow guidelines for installation heights and clearances.

### TECHNICAL DATA 

The unit is designed for efficient operation under specified conditions. Ensure proper clearance around the installation area.

#### VENTILATION OF THE UNIT 

Proper ventilation is critical, especially in high-temperature environments.

### LP GAS CONNECTION 

Ensure that the LP gas operates at the correct pressure, as specified by the manufacturer. 

### CAUTION 

Always check gas pressure and connections before operating the refrigerator.

This device features continuously operating bottled and threaded connections. PUSH-ON CONNECTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED for this type of permanently operating connection. Specifically designed for the United States, the supply must be connected securely to a gas-tight cock rated for bottled gas. The installation should be easy for servicing, allowing for access to the outlet of the cock. A qualified technician must conduct a thorough inspection upon installation.

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS** must comply with operational regulations, ensuring effective grounding. The electricity supply should be properly earthed, with the outlet conveniently accessible. For wiring, adhere to the following color codes: 

- **Green/Yellow** - Earth
- **Brown** - Live
- **Blue** - Neutral

In accordance with B.S., if an ASTA fuse is used, ensure that the ratings comply with international standards. Wires should be routed securely to prevent damage. The battery connections must also be correctly polarized to ensure optimal performance.

For satisfactory operation, connections should provide the appropriate current rating. All components, including lights, should be directly connected to the battery or battery charger.

For replacement procedures, remove the cover carefully from the back, ensuring proper reinstatement upon completion. 

**TECHNICAL DATA RM**: Dimensions and cooling capacity parameters are specified according to ISO standards.
