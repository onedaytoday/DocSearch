### Water Heater Instructions

#### Overview
This document outlines the essential instructions for operating the ELECTROLUX IH instantaneous water heater, including flow rate settings, wall mounting procedures, maintenance tips, and safety precautions.

#### Appliance Functionality
The ELECTROLUX IH heater continuously heats water as it flows through the unit, with flow rates selectable from approximately 30°C to 60°C. For optimal use, set the thermostat for shower temperatures at 40°C and bath temperatures at 55°C. Please note that the output temperature will be about 8°C higher than the thermostat setting, and the appliance will automatically switch off if the flow rate drops below a specified level.

#### Installation
The heater must be installed using the supplied wall-mounting template and appropriate hardware. Ensure that the installation area is frost-free, and the system is properly flushed before connection.

#### Maintenance
To ensure efficiency and safety, regularly clean the housing with a damp cloth and inspect the shower head for blockages. If performance lags, consider cleaning the outlet fixtures.

#### Compliance and Safety
The appliance complies with IEC and DIN standards, along with EC Directives relevant to electromagnetic compatibility. Always follow local electrical regulations when connecting the device. Safety features include a protective cover and overheating shutdown mechanisms.

#### Troubleshooting
If issues arise, check the following:
- Ensure water supply is sufficient.
- Verify that no obstructions are present in the flow path.
- Inspect electrical connections for wear or damage.
