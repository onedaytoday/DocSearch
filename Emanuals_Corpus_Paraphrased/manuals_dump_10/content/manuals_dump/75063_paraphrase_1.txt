**AG-72D-UK ENGLISH**

Using the microwave is straightforward, whether you are defrosting, reheating, or cooking food. For optimal results, refer to the recommended cooking times. It's typically better to reduce the cooking time rather than overcook the food. Start by defrosting or reheating before proceeding with cooking, ensuring that food is heated evenly (usually around 75°C for cooked items).

Follow specific microwave instructions to avoid issues like exploding shells or splattering due to heat build-up. The cooking process can involve direct heat, which may create hot spots; thus, rotating or turning food items helps ensure even cooking.

**Microwave Operations:**
- Use a thermometer to check that food reaches the correct internal temperature, particularly for meat and poultry. Clear juices indicate proper cooking. Overcooked meat tends to be tough.
- When preparing ready meals, cover them to retain moisture and heat evenly. Adjust heating times based on the quantity; for instance, double the amount generally requires double the cooking time.

Microwave shapes affect cooking efficiency. Round foods tend to cook more evenly than those with corners. It’s crucial to cover foods while cooking to promote even heating and prevent drying out, especially for denser items.

When defrosting, use appropriate settings to avoid cooking the exterior while the interior remains frozen. The amount of food impacts defrosting times; larger portions require more time. Always check food periodically and rearrange items for thorough heating.

For fresh food, season as you would normally. Ensure meat is cooked thoroughly, turning or stirring as needed for even heat distribution.

Follow specific microwave cooking guidelines:
- When reheating soups or meat, ensure they are covered.
- Utilize the timer and power settings appropriately, adjusting as needed during the cooking cycle.
- Use dual grill or microwave modes for browning food, combining modes as necessary for diverse cooking needs.

**Cooking Workflow:**
- To operate multiple cooking sequences, select the cooking mode and set the desired time, following prompts and adjusting power levels as required.
