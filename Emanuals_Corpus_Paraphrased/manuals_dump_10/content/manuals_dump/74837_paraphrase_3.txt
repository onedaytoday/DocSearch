## Operating Instructions

### Description/Construction
This appliance features a polished stainless-steel build and includes several functions such as Browning, Preparation, Steaming, and more. It is designed to handle large quantities of food effectively, operating at temperatures up to 212°F (100°C) or 228°F (109°C) for precise cooking.

### Initial Operation 
Before use, ensure thorough cleaning and heating the unit to approximately 320°F (160°C). Maintain a proper ratio of contents to prevent overfilling, ensuring safe operation while performing daily tasks.

### Standby Mode
While in standby mode, the device should remain closed to optimize heating and efficiency. Regular checks are important to confirm functionality and settings.

### Automatic Control
Follow the detailed instructions for setting the clock and adjusting temperatures. The unit will provide auditory cues and visual signals to indicate cooking status. Different cooking modes and timings can be adjusted according to user preferences.

### Maintenance

Always switch off the main power and consult authorized service providers for extensive repairs or maintenance needs.

### Revised Instructions for Equipment Operation

1. **Extinguishing Functions:**  
   Turn the dial from (LS) to (H) to deactivate the device. If cooking is complete, switch to (S) to turn off the cooking functions. The cooking modes associated with buttons (TT), (DT), and (ZT) will remain activated until the switch (S) is toggled off. If the switch is turned off while the appliance is in operation, it will cease all cooking activities.  

2. **Soft Functionality:**  
   Pressing the Soft button (R) reduces power to the food, preventing burning while ensuring even heating. The visual indicators (LR) will display the switched-on status while the following functions (Q): (AT) and (AD) will inform you about the cooking status, including an acoustic signal upon completion. If the Soft function is active, ensure food is heated according to specific types to avoid sticking issues.  

3. **Timer Functions:**  
   The CLOCK TIME display (AZ) will show the current time, while the cooking timer (AT) will indicate the cooking duration. When the switch (S) is turned off, follow the operating instructions regarding HACCP appliances, which can also monitor cooking progress through the THERMACAM feature.  

4. **Mechanical Tilting:**  
   When operating the mechanical tilting function, turn the switch (S) from I to LS. The light (K) indicates the emptying status. To proceed, rotate the switch clockwise to activate the top function while aiming the outlet towards the front. The switch (K) will self-lock once released, preventing accidental operation.  

5. **Temperature Control:**  
   For cooking, select the desired temperature using the (T) function up to the recommended settings: 212°F (100°C) for standard cooking and up to 394°F (250°C) for pressure cooking. Ensure the device automatically shuts off or is manually switched off once the temperature is reached to prevent overheating or food spoilage.  

6. **Steam Management:**  
   When using the steam outlet and release valve, ensure these are correctly closed before starting to prevent issues during operation. Properly locked lids are mandatory for efficient steam management. Avoid splashing by keeping the lid securely in place while cooking to manage steam flow effectively.  

7. **Cooking Equipment Guidelines:**  
   Use GN trays (perforated GN1/1 and GN1/1) to facilitate air circulation during cooking. Maintain the appliance closed and locked throughout the cooking process to ensure even cooking at the appropriate temperatures, preventing food from burning or sticking.  

8. **Special Cooking Instructions:**  
   For specific food items like meat, poultry, and vegetables, follow the prescribed cooking phases, adjusting temperatures as needed. Items should be monitored closely to maintain proper texture and prevent overcooking.  

9. **Closing Procedures:**  
   To finalize cooking, turn the switch off, release the lid gently, and allow steam to escape safely. Ensure that the steam outlet is closed properly and that the locking mechanism is engaged to avoid any cooking mishaps.  

By adhering to these operational instructions, effective and safe use of the equipment can be guaranteed. Always ensure compliance with safety protocols while cooking.

**Operating Instructions for Cooking Equipment**

**Cooking Process:** 
Ensure food is cooked thoroughly according to the specified guidelines. Preheat the equipment to 302°F (150°C) and use a perforated GN container to enhance cooking efficiency. Cooking duration and release times should be monitored based on the specific food type. Maintain the proper food-to-equipment ratio.

**Food Quality:** 
Adjust cooking parameters based on the batch size and the type of food being processed, whether chilled or at room temperature. The quality of food will depend on the selected cooking method.

**Cleaning Protocol:** 
Clean the appliance after each use. Turn off the power and allow it to cool before cleaning. Use a non-abrasive cloth or absorbent materials to remove grease and residue. Ensure that all components are free of contaminants. Regular cleaning should be performed to prevent malfunctions.

**Troubleshooting:** 
If any acoustic signals or error codes are displayed, turn off the power and consult the troubleshooting section for assistance. If necessary, contact service personnel for specific error codes (E1, E2, E4, E5, J15, E6, E7, E9, E10, E21, E22, E23, E24). 

**Maintenance Note:** 
Treat appliances used in commercial kitchens with care to avoid formation of residues or chemical reactions. Use suitable cleaning agents on the appropriate surfaces and avoid harsh methods that could cause damage. Always follow regulatory guidelines for safe operation.

**Final Reminder:** Ensure that any cleaning agents used are compatible with food preparations and do not leave harmful residues behind. Regular maintenance and adherence to these protocols will ensure optimal performance and longevity of the equipment.
