To recall a preference, select MY FAVORITE and press START to activate it. To overwrite an existing favorite, follow the prompts to select and confirm the new settings.

### SABBATH FEATURE (FOR JEWISH SABBATH HOLIDAYS)

To activate the Sabbath feature, set the oven to "Bake" and adjust the temperature as necessary. The indicators will signal if the setup is correct. Once activated properly, the oven will remain ON continuously for a duration of 12 hours. If the oven light activates during the Sabbath, it can be turned OFF, but the light should not remain ON if the user attempts to deactivate it.

#### IMPORTANT NOTES:
Only the "Bake" function should be utilized during this period. The keypads for other functions will be disabled once the Sabbath feature is engaged. To preheat the oven to 350°F, press the "OVEN" button followed by "BAKE." Refer to the instructions for setting the cooking duration and press "START" to begin heating. After the desired cooking duration, the oven will maintain heating for at least 30 seconds before turning OFF.

### SABBATH FEATURE (CONTINUED)

After initiating the bake cycle, you can set the temperature to 425°F and press "START" twice. Only use the "CANCEL" function to turn the oven OFF. Follow the same timing instructions as mentioned earlier. The oven will automatically deactivate, and all functions should revert to standby unless reset. 

### CLEANING

#### USING THE SELF-CLEAN FEATURE
Before cleaning, ensure that the oven is OFF and has cooled down. Always wear protective gloves while manually cleaning. Ensure children are kept away during the self-cleaning cycle. Do not use abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch surfaces. 

#### STARTING SELF-CLEAN CYCLE
To initiate a self-cleaning cycle, close the oven door and press the "CLEAN" button. Select the desired cleaning duration: LITE (1 hour), MEDIUM (3 hours), or HEAVY (5 hours). Press "START." The door will lock while cleaning is in progress, and the cycle lasts about an hour. If the oven overheats or produces smoke, immediately press "CANCEL."

#### CARE AND CLEANING OF STAINLESS STEEL
For stainless steel maintenance, refer to the cleaning section. To remove and replace the oven door, follow the specific instructions located on the door's hinges. 

#### LIGHT SHIELD AND OVEN LIGHT
Ensure the oven is cool before touching the light shield. The shield must be in place when using the oven. Clean the shield carefully to avoid accidental glass damage.

### COOKING TIPS
Preheating is crucial when baking cookies or cakes. Avoid overcrowding the oven and monitor temperatures to prevent burning. For optimal results, preheat the oven to the recommended settings, which may be slightly higher than normal for certain recipes. 

### TROUBLESHOOTING
For service issues, including error codes or malfunctioning controls, cancel the current operation and consult an authorized service representative. Ensure all connections are secure and that there is power to the oven. 

If meats smoke excessively during broiling, reposition them to ensure proper clearance and avoid built-up grease. For any residual soil after self-cleaning, refer to cleaning instructions to reinstate optimal performance.
