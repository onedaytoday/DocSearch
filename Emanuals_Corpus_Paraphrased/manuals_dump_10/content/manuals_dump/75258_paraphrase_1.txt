### BOOST FUNCTION AND PIZZA BAKING FUNCTION

**BOOST FUNCTION**  
The Boost Function accelerates the heating process, allowing selected functions to reach the desired temperature quickly. If necessary, the preheating function can be employed to achieve this. 

**PIZZA BAKING FUNCTION**  
The Pizza Baking Function is ideal for cooking various foods that need specific heating requirements. When selecting this function, the top element activates, and an indicator will blink until the temperature is reached. 

**THINGS TO NOTE**

To activate the defrost feature, select it through the function menu and choose the desired number of seconds to confirm (the display will flash). The internal light will illuminate during operation. To deactivate, simply switch off the function once the thawing is complete.

#### Important Considerations
- The cooling light will activate during the defrosting process. 
- Thawing is influenced by ambient temperature; it's generally easier to thaw meat or thinly cut items.
- Defrosting times may vary; for example, thin chops may take a few hours, while larger cuts could require longer. Ensure all types of meat and poultry are completely thawed before cooking to ensure even cooking.
- Do not refreeze any food once it has been defrosted; cook it promptly.

#### Food Safety Tips
When purchasing and preparing food, adhere to basic food safety practices to inhibit bacterial growth. Ensure that perishable items are kept insulated and stored immediately after purchase. Reheat and cool foods appropriately, and follow proper cooking instructions to ensure thorough reheating. Use a meat thermometer to verify temperatures, aiming for:

- 60°C for poultry
- 70°C for ground meats
- 80°C for whole cuts.

#### Main Oven Light and Safety Features

To activate the main oven light, select a cooking function; the light will turn on automatically. You can also turn it off during cooking if needed. 

#### Safety Cut-off Function
The oven will automatically switch off under certain conditions:
- Temperatures over 250°C for extended periods.
- If cooking is prolonged beyond specified hours.

#### Child Safety Lock
To activate or deactivate the child safety lock, press and hold designated buttons simultaneously for several seconds until a sound is heard and the display indicates "SAFE." Repeat this operation to unlock.

### Second Oven Usage
The second oven is specifically designed to heat from the top and is effective for baking cakes and other dishes at a temperature setting of 100°C and above. Select the appropriate function from the menu, confirming your choice, and adjust as necessary during cooking.

#### Telescopic Runners (if applicable)
Ensure shelves are installed correctly, aligning them at the back of the cavity and adjusting for optimal positioning. 

#### Cooking Guidelines
Place food centrally on shelves, allowing space for airflow to reduce splashes. Avoid overcrowding to ensure even cooking. Use appropriate cookware materials that enhance browning and reduce cooking times. Avoid using rough surfaces or enamelware that may obstruct heat distribution.

### Grill Use
Exercise caution when using the grill, as accessible parts may become hot. Keep children at a safe distance. You can choose between single or dual grill options, ensuring the grill door remains open during operation.

### Care and Cleaning
Always allow the oven to cool before cleaning. Use recommended cleaning agents, avoiding bleach and harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces. Take care to clean the exterior and any fitted components with suitable materials to maintain their finish. 

#### General Cleaning Guidelines
When cleaning the outer surfaces, employ soft cloths and designated cleaners to avoid dulling the finish. Use only recommended materials for the brass-plated elements to ensure long-lasting quality.

### Cleaning Inside the Ovens

To clean Stayclean surfaces, follow the manufacturer's instructions. This coating helps repel food splashes during cooking at temperatures around 220°C. Generally, cleaning should be done at least once per hour to maintain performance. 

**Hints and Tips**: It’s advised to clean Stayclean surfaces regularly and avoid buildup that could impair function. When roasting, consider cooking meat at higher temperatures to minimize splattering; refrain from brushing the meat while it cooks. Covering the food can help prevent splashes and over-browning.

### Removing and Replacing Wire Runners and Shelves

To remove the wire shelves, unhook them from the top and pull out from the back of the cavity. This process is generally simple, especially if not heavily used. Regular cleaning of the cavity and shelves is recommended.

### Cleaning the Triple Glazed Door Glass

For the inner glass of the oven door, use household cleaners or bleaches. To access the inner glass, clear the area and follow the specific steps for removal. If the glass is chipped or scratched, contact customer service for assistance.

To clean the middle glass panel, ensure it is free from debris and follow cleaning instructions to avoid damage.

### Replacing an Oven Light Bulb

The oven light functions during cooking based on the selected settings. Before replacing the bulb, turn off the electricity supply and allow the oven to cool. Use a screwdriver to remove the cover and replace the bulb, ensuring you're using the correct type rated for 300°C.

### If Something Doesn't Work

If issues arise, refer to the service guide for troubleshooting advice. Customers should verify functionality without necessitating service due to a breakdown. Care should be taken to ensure the power is connected correctly and that the clock is set.

**Common Problems and Solutions**: 
- If the appliance fails to cool properly, let it cool down for a few hours. 
- Ensure the correct temperature settings are applied when cooking.
