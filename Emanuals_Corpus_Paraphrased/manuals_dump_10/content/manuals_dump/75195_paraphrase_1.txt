Ensure the food is correctly placed on the shelf so that it is evenly exposed to heat from the top. Hints include allowing adequate distance between foods to facilitate proper cooking, particularly for thicker items, and ensuring they are positioned centrally on the shelf. Preheat the grill as necessary, and adjust the shelf position to suit the foods being prepared, which enables optimal browning.

### Grilling Chart

The chart below provides recommended cooking times for various items, counted from the top shelf downwards. Suggested foods include rashers, chops, and whole trout, all of which should be placed on the high shelf for best results.

### Fan-Assisted Top Oven

The fan-assisted oven provides an efficient method of cooking, perfect for various foods. Consult the top cooking chart for appropriate settings. To operate, turn the Selector clockwise. Notably, the cooling fan remains on until the oven cools down. Ensure the shelves are correctly placed and can support dishes, with the top shelf counted from above.

### Hints and Tips

When cooking at temperatures between 80°C and 100°C, it is beneficial to use both shelves for even heat distribution. For optimal results, particularly with yeast-based recipes, position food centrally on the shelf to achieve desired browning effects. Heavy enamelware or glass can enhance browning, while heavier dishes are recommended to manage splatters inside the oven. Ensure food is preheated appropriately to reduce overall cooking time.

### Conventional Top Oven

The conventional oven allows for traditional cooking methods. It is suitable for various dishes, including gratins. To use, turn the Selector clockwise. Be aware that the cooling system operates until the oven cools down.

### Hints and Tips

Ensure heat is evenly distributed to promote even cooking and browning. Heavy enamelware can assist with browning, while glassware may lead to slower results. For less intensive cooking, be prepared for longer cooking times, especially when not using the fan-assisted function.

### Top Oven Cooking Chart

For optimal cooking results, refer to the specific temperature and shelf position for various foods, like meringues and tarts.

### Thermal Grilling

The thermal grilling function offers an efficient method for cooking items typically associated with grilling. With this setting, you can cook with the oven closed, which helps to retain moisture. It’s recommended for dishes like shepherd's pie and gratins. Ensure food is placed properly for consistent results.

### Defrosting in the Top Oven

This function allows for the defrosting of foods without the application of heat. It's ideal for cakes with frosting or cheesecakes. To defrost, simply follow the Selector instructions. Monitor the process closely, particularly for meats.

### Main Fan Oven

The fan oven is effective for cooking a variety of foods. It is advisable to preheat the oven to ensure accurate cooking times. For batch baking, utilize the accordingly to optimize shelf usage and improve heat distribution.

### To Fit the Main Oven Shelves

Ensure that ovens are fitted correctly and that shelves are straight. Align to the back of the oven for optimal results.

### Final Tips

Space shelves adequately to promote airflow and even cooking. Be mindful of cooking times in correlation with the oven type, and always follow the cooking charts to avoid over-browning or undercooking.

### HINTS AND TIPS

To enhance top browning, heat should be properly regulated. Enamelware and heavy non-stick cookware can promote browning, while glassware and polished trays may limit it. Positioning food centrally on the shelves aids in achieving even browning. When cooking, understand that cleaning requirements can vary depending on the cookware used.
