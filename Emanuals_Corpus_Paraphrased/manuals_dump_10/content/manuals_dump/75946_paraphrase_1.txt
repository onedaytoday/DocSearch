**COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Functionality**

The COOLMATIC function activates cooling within a specified temperature range and can be selected manually. The status indicator lights up accordingly, reflecting the desired temperature settings and actual conditions. If the COOLMATIC function is manually switched on, it operates for a certain number of hours.

The FROSTMATIC function enhances the preservation of fresh food by quickly freezing products while safeguarding previously stored items. This function is activated by pressing the FROSTMATIC button, with the yellow light indicating its operation. Manual activation of FROSTMATIC may require it to be switched off after a set duration, depending on user preference.

To turn off the appliance, simultaneously press both ON/OFF buttons for several seconds until it initiates a countdown. In case of interruptions to the power supply, the appliance will either switch off automatically or may require a manual reset. For defrosting, ensure the compartment is completely sealed to prevent moisture buildup.

Take care not to leave the appliance door open, as this can lead to spoilage and mold. To adjust shelf heights for optimal space usage, place larger items on lower shelves and store smaller items on higher levels. Always position bottles securely, ensuring their mouths are accessible in the front rows.

Proper maintenance is essential. Regularly defrost the unit according to the guidelines to avoid performance issues, typically once a year or as frost builds up. For thorough cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the power supply and follow recommended procedures.

Be aware of any warning signals or tones indicating temperature fluctuations or appliance malfunctions. These should be addressed promptly for continued functionality. Ensure food items are adequately covered during storage to prevent cross-contamination.

In case of technical issues or if the appliance requires service, contact the designated support centers for assistance. Always follow safety precautions when handling appliances to avoid hazards.
