**Paraphrased Text:**

If there's an issue with your appliance, it may be due to the service force's intervention. Common indications include frost buildup and unusual sounds from the household lights. Ensure that the appliance is correctly closed and the food is not obstructing it, as this can affect its operation. If the light switch is not airtight, it may impact the heating function. 

For immediate concerns, customers should contact AEG Service Force, particularly for mechanical failures or breakdowns. This falls under warranty coverage upon purchase.

The cooling process involves transferring heat from the food or other items, which is then expelled into the environment. The appliance's heat exchanger, typically located at the rear, plays a critical role in this cooling mechanism.
