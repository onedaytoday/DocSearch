**COOK TIME** enables automatic cooking with a timer feature, allowing the appliance to turn off once the countdown finishes. This can be utilized with functions like Convection, Warm, Defrost, Proof, and Perfect Cooking. To set the temperature to 450°F, press the OVEN button and then the BAKE button. Access additional cooking options by pressing COOK OPTIONS. Start the heating process by pressing COOK TIME, followed by START. You can cancel or stop the cooking at any time by pressing CANCEL.

**END TIME** works similarly, turning off the appliance when the countdown concludes. To set an end time, follow the same procedure to select OVEN, then BAKE, and input the desired cooking finish time. As with COOK TIME, you can cancel or stop cooking as needed.

**Important**: To avoid foodborne illnesses, properly cook meats and poultry, and consume food promptly after cooking. In case of fire, safely turn off the appliance and use a fire extinguisher if necessary; do not attempt to extinguish grease fires with water.

**BROILING** involves high heat, ideal for cooking thicker meats quickly. It typically ranges from 300°F to 550°F. Preheat the oven for optimal browning results, and refrain from covering food, as uncovered grease can ignite.

**CONVECTION BAKING** offers even cooking by circulating hot air, ideal for similar-sized foods. Temperatures range from 170°F to 550°F with a standard cooking temperature of 350°F. Preheating is essential for consistent results.

**CONVECTION CONVERT** is a feature designed to adjust recipes for convection cooking. It is crucial to follow specific adjustments for different types of food, as indicated in the CONVECTION section.

**RAPID PREHEAT** is designed for quicker preheating, applicable when roasting or cooking various items. The temperature settings and cooking ranges mimic those of Convection Cooking.

**CONVECTION ROASTING** continuously circulates heat, optimizing cooking for various meats at temperatures between 170°F and 550°F. Secure roasting pans to prevent grease spillage and facilitate even cooking.

**KEEP WARM** maintains food temperature between 150°F and 190°F, ideal for keeping finished dishes warm without overcooking.

**SLOW COOK** settings allow for gradual cooking, similar to a slow cooker. It’s essential to monitor cooking times closely to prevent burning, especially for poultry. 

**DEHYDRATING** utilizes low heat to remove moisture from foods such as fruits and vegetables, typically at temperatures between 100°F and 225°F, with a standard setting of 120°F. 

**DEFROSTING** allows for safe thawing of frozen foods by operating at low temperatures. It’s essential to defrost foods appropriately to prevent bacterial growth.

### BREAD PROOFING

Proofing activates the yeast in the dough, typically at a temperature range of 85°F to 100°F, ideally around 100°F. **Tips for Proofing:** Preheat the oven to the lowest setting, allowing the cavity to warm up for a minimum of 10 minutes. To initiate proofing, press the OVEN button to turn on the light, followed by pressing the BREAD PROOF option and then START. To cancel, press CANCEL. While proofing is active, you can press the OVEN button to light the cooking space and adjust temperatures using the HI or LO settings before pressing START to confirm.

### PERFECT TURKEY

This function ensures precise cooking of turkey between 170°F and 550°F, with a recommended temperature around 325°F and an internal target of 180°F. **Tips for Perfect Turkey:** Thaw your turkey for several hours beforehand and preheat the oven using the Perfect Turkey option. Ensure a roasting pan catches any grease, and the turkey is securely seated within it, allowing for even cooking. To initiate this function, press the OVEN button, select PERFECT TURKEY, and press START. You can also use the PROBE feature to monitor internal temperatures, ensuring doneness by canceling or adjusting as necessary.

### TEMPERATURE PROBE

The temperature probe accurately measures the internal temperature of meats and roasts to ensure thorough cooking. This feature works well with Convection cooking and has a temperature range of 130°F to 210°F, with a focus point of 170°F. **Important:** Ensure the food is properly thawed or set up without interference while cooking. Insert the probe into the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bones. After placing it, press the OVEN button to activate cooking. As internal temperatures approach 170°F, you may press COOK OPTIONS for alternative settings or START to finalize. For monitoring, press KEEP WARM or CANCEL if adjustments are needed.

### MULTI-STAGE COOKING

The Multi-Stage function allows for three separate cooking processes, including Convection and Proof settings. To employ it, press OVEN and then MULTI STAGE, followed by your choice of cooking method (e.g., CONVECTION BAKE). Press START to proceed through each stage, following prompts. If multiple cooking stages are set, the display will indicate progression, allowing for easy management of your dishes.

### USER PREFERENCES

User Preferences let you customize settings, including clock options (Continuous, Hour Clock, No-Clock) and temperature display (Fahrenheit or Celsius). To access preferences, press USER PREF and navigate through the options. To set the clock to the correct time or adjust it after a power interruption, refer to user instructions. The clock can be toggled on or off as needed.

### SABBATH FEATURE

The Sabbath feature allows for uninterrupted cooking during Jewish holidays. It maintains constant heat without disruption from cooking alerts. To activate, ensure you set the cooking function correctly, ideally on BAKE. After confirming, the system will maintain its settings until manually turned off, observing all necessary cooking guidelines for the duration.

### CONTINUING WITH THE SABBATH FEATURE

To initiate, press the BAKE button and set it to 425°F, then press START twice. To deactivate the feature, press CANCEL (this turns the oven OFF only). To switch OFF, hold both the HI and LO buttons for at least a few seconds. Should the oven turn OFF, it will revert back automatically. The SF indicator will display during this process, which is meant to suspend cooking. If you wish to turn OFF the Sabbath feature, press both the HI and LO buttons for at least a few seconds again.

### USING THE SELF-CLEANING FEATURE

Ensure the oven cools down before engaging the self-cleaning cycle. Use appropriate gear when performing manual cleaning. Do not interrupt the self-cleaning cycle by turning it OFF or pressing CANCEL until it has cooled down. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or protective coatings on the self-cleaning surfaces. Clean the oven cavity with a damp cloth. Remember that self-cleaning may produce smoke or fire if food particles are present; ensure you are not cleaning with high-energy items. The self-cleaning feature can help maintain cleanliness and reduce the need for heavy-duty cleanings in the future. 

### GENERAL CLEANING

Immediately address any spillovers or heavy soiling. Regular cleaning helps minimize the frequency of extensive cleanings later. Use a soft cloth to maintain painted and decorative surfaces, as well as chrome racks. Avoid using harsh cleaners that may scratch surfaces. For stubborn grease, apply a cleaner and wipe it off gently. 

### OVEN DOOR HANDLING

To remove and replace the oven door, locate the hinge slots at the front and use care to avoid injury. 

### OVEN LIGHT MAINTENANCE

The oven light will turn ON and OFF with the door, and the light switch is located inside. Clean the light shield manually as necessary, ensuring it is in place during oven use. Always allow the oven to cool before handling the shield.

### CLEANING TIPS

For the broiler pan, avoid covering it while in use and promptly address any grease build-up. 

### COMMON ISSUES

If the oven experiences issues such as beeping or error codes, press CANCEL to reset. If the oven does not operate as expected, ensure the power supply is securely connected, and check for blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers.

If you encounter excessive smoking or results during broiling or self-cleaning, adjust your methods accordingly to ensure optimal performance. Always follow manufacturer instructions to avoid issues with the cleaning cycle.
