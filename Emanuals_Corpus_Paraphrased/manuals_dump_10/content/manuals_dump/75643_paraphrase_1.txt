GN Chillers facilitate the rapid cooling of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly minimizing bacterial growth. This process allows food to be held at +3°C without compromising safety. The system features various operational modes including Soft Chilling (2°C) and regular chilling (20°C), and is designed for efficiency during food insertion. It includes built-in features such as NF and UK compliant UV, defrosting capabilities, and countdown displays for service information. The device records operational data relevant to HACCP, especially in cases of abnormal termination.

**Performance**: The chiller effectively reduces food temperature from +90°C to +3°C based on its chilling capacity.

**Construction**: It is constructed from AISI stainless steel with high-density polyurethane insulation and rounded corners, ensuring compliance with ISO standards. The exterior has an IP20 rating for protection during cleaning.

**Technical Data**: The chiller’s productivity complies with UK chilling regulations (D.I.N. Cooling) and includes built-in thermostats and thermometers, with specifications for size and type.

**Included Accessories**: 
- 3-sensor probe for chiller/freezer applications
- Additional sensors and probes for various configurations
- HACCP advanced connectivity options
- Tower support for ovens
- Tray racks and wheels for efficient operation

**Installation**: Options for plumbing and remote cooling are available, with required electric connections specified.

**Certification**: The chiller is certified by AFAQ AFNOR under the NF Hygiene Alimentaire authority, ensuring compliance with NF031 for cleaning and thermal performance.
