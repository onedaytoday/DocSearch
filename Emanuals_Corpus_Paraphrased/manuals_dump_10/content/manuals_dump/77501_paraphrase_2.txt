Continue holding these buttons until adjustments are made; then, release them. To set the month and date, use the MONTH/DATE button as needed, and ensure both the month and date are displayed correctly. Adjust the TIME to confirm the AM or PM setting is accurate.  

**Care and Maintenance:**  
To care for the device, regularly clean its surface using a lint-free cloth. Avoid using abrasive cleaners. For CDs, use a dedicated CD cleaning solution as required. It's advised not to allow moisture to accumulate during cleaning.
