Hereâ€™s a more technical paraphrase of the provided text, maintaining the original meaning:

---

To use the convection heating function for baking cakes, pastries, and breads, preheat the oven at the specified temperature. Ensure that the cakes are evenly cooked by monitoring their rise closely; if too high, the cakes may overcook. Proper greasing of pans helps in preventing sticking and aids in even heat distribution.

For roasting, this function allows for various adjustments based on the type and thickness of the meat. Refer to the roasting chart for guidance to avoid burning. Meat should be cooked at the recommended temperatures, switching off the heat briefly if necessary.

The defrosting function requires you to unwrap food and cover it appropriately to minimize moisture loss during thawing. Further defrosting may involve turning the food occasionally.

For drying, ensure that food items are arranged on shelves without overlapping. Maintain a consistent temperature to achieve optimal results.

Safety precautions include turning off the appliance before cleaning to avoid electric shock. Use non-abrasive cleaners to protect the surfaces from scratches and damage.

For any technical issues or repairs, refer to the customer service guidelines and ensure proper isolation of the appliance from power sources before servicing.

Recycling information indicates that this appliance should not be disposed of with regular household waste. Instead, follow local regulations for the correct disposal method.

For additional assistance or servicing requirements, consult the provided customer service details, including necessary appliance identification numbers.
