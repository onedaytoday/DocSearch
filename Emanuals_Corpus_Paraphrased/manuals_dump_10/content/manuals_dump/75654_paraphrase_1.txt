The high-quality cooking products have been enhanced through effective thawing processes. Utilizing a thermometer, the thawing achieves optimal results, ensuring that fresh items retain their quality, including elasticity, moisture, and color. This process is facilitated by materials designed with smooth, rounded corners for ease of use.

The defrosting procedure is straightforward: once the food reaches the appropriate temperature, the system automatically transitions from thawing to a reduction phase. This efficiency shortens defrosting times compared to traditional methods, benefiting the overall quality of the food.

The unit operates effectively at temperatures up to +85Â°C, activating a bactericidal cleaning function to maintain hygiene across all components and food items stored within. 

Key specifications of the thawing cabinet include:

- Built-in cooling type with a mechanical thermostat
- Capacity for GN 1/1 containers
- Height and width dimensions designed for optimal use

The TC18 and TCR120R models both accommodate GN or GN 1/1 baskets/containers. Accessories like trolleys, guide rails, and perforated containers are available to maximize efficiency.

This equipment is compliant with HACCP standards and is designed with environmental considerations in mind, supporting sustainable practices in food handling.
