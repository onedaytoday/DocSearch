20GN1/1 facilitates the chilling of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively reducing bacterial levels from +90°C to +3°C and then to -18°C within four hours. This chilling/freezing process supports food preservation at specified temperatures. Frozen food can be stored for several months. The unit operates under multiple modes, including Soft Chilling (2°C) and standard chilling (20°C to +3°C or -18°C). Each mode continuously maintains temperature, as designed by ARTE, and provides operational feedback, including a countdown display, service notifications, and data related to HACCP compliance.

The performance metrics highlight that chilling acts from +90°C to +3°C in less than four hours. The unit is constructed with AISI stainless steel and high-density polyurethane insulation, complying with ISO standards, and features rounded corners for safety, alongside IP20 protection rating.

Key specifications include sensors for temperature regulation, robust shelving units, and HACCP compliance options. Various accessories are available such as GN trays, printers, and defrosting options. Installation may require plumbing, and the unit can support high-capacity cold storage solutions. Overall, this equipment offers essential features for efficient cooling and preservation of food.
