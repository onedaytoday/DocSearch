### INSTALLING THE WINE COOLER

For both free-standing and built-in installations, ensure the front of the unit is unobstructed. 

### SITE PREPARATION

Before proceeding, consider the weight of the cooler once loaded. It should be installed in a location with a proper ground connection and connected to a 15A household outlet. Adhere to local codes and ordinances. 

**IMPORTANT: ELECTROCUTION HAZARD!** Grounding is essential. Use a three-prong grounding plug for shock protection. Avoid using the unit with non-grounded or two-prong outlets.

### DOOR SWING & AIRFLOW

Ensure proper clearance for door swing, intake, and exhaust. The unit requires sufficient clearance for air circulation, specifically a minimum of 1 inch at the front. Clean the front of the cooler with a soft cloth to maintain airflow. 

### WINE RACKS WITH WOOD TRIM

The cooler is designed with stained wood racks for aesthetics and durability. The factory-applied clear finish should be preserved. **CAUTION:** Do not alter the finish of the wood trim once it has been applied. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for finishing, allowing adequate drying time as specified.

If applying any additional stain or finish, ensure it is compatible with the wood and allows sufficient drying time before further handling.

### RACK REMOVAL/INSTALLATION

To remove the racks, carefully unscrew them. Clean the moldings with a soft cloth and use a thin layer of protective finish to maintain or enhance their appearance. Reapply finishes as needed following the manufacturer's guidelines.

### LEVELING THE UNIT

To level the cooler, adjust the four leveling feet by turning them clockwise or counterclockwise as necessary to achieve balance. 

### REVERSING THE DOOR

The door can be easily reversed from right to left. Remove the top plastic plugs and screws, and then relocate the top and bottom hinges according to the provided instructions. Ensure the alignment is correct before securely fastening all screws. 

Proper installation and maintenance will ensure the optimal performance of your wine cooler.
