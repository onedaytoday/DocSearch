**Connector Assembly Instructions:**

For proper assembly, use a Head Screwdriver to attach the Connector Housing securely to the designated section. Ensure the threads of the housing line up correctly. Once aligned, screw the housing tightly in a clockwise direction. The completed assembly will support the IR, RF, or wall switch operations.

**Installation Steps:**

1. Connect the housing components (specifically parts C and D), ensuring to assemble the 6PCS as indicated.
2. Position the housings on the dedicated boards (F and H).
3. Once aligned, secure the housings together and complete the assembly as described in the installation guide.

**Shelf Installation:**

The Infrared-Sensitive (ISSD) feature may obstruct closing if the light beams are interrupted. Ensure any obstructions are cleared promptly and keep the sensor clean with a soft cloth to maintain longevity. Avoid exposure to heat or fire, which may damage the unit.

**Troubleshooting:** 

In case of malfunction, immediately cease operation and inspect for any items blocking the ISSD sensor, which may affect both the IR and RF connectivity with the switch. For warranty claims, refer to the details below.
