### Signal Polarity and Clock Adjustment 

The system supports various input types, including VGA and SXGA with specific clock settings. Adjustments can be made either wirelessly or via the control panel to manage signal polarity.

### Image Adjustment Functions 

To switch between positive and negative displays, use the [POSI/NEGA] button. Pressing it will toggle between modes. The rotation function can be activated using the [IMAGE ROTATION] button, allowing for counterclockwise adjustments. 

### Conclusion

For a comprehensive operation, always refer to the corresponding pages for detailed settings and maintenance procedures.

### Wireless Control System Overview

**MONITOR OUTPUT**: The system provides options to pause the output, adjust the iris, and control RGB settings (RGB1 and RGB2). The [PAUSE] button on the front panel allows for temporary halting of operations, which can be canceled by pressing the button again.

**Image Adjustments**: Character and background tones can be modified through the [CONTRAST] button. Pressing this button adjusts brightness levels, enhancing overall image contrast. The settings include options for NEGA and POSI contrast, as well as control over the WHITE IMAGE LAMP BALANCE in AUTO or MANUAL modes.

**White Balance Settings**: The white balance can be set manually or automatically. By pressing the [WHITE BALANCE] button, users can stabilize white tones in the image. This includes options for ONE-PUSH white balance and manual adjustments accessible through the on-screen display (OSD).

**Iris Control**: Users can control the iris brightness both automatically and manually. The brightness can be adjusted using the [OPEN] and [CLOSE] buttons either on the front panel or via wireless control. Pressing the [AUTO/MANUAL] toggle will switch modes, allowing for operation in either setting.

**Auto Focus (AF) Function**: The [AF] button can be activated to manage focus automatically. Once focusing is achieved, the function releases to allow for a focus-free operation. This system helps in handling bright backgrounds and varying light conditions. If users wish to fine-tune focus, the [FOCUS NEAR] or [FOCUS FAR] buttons can be pressed.

**Memory Functions**: The device includes preset and memory functions for saving various settings. Users can set and call these presets, allowing for quick adjustments depending on the shooting conditions. The white balance and light configurations can also be saved and restored.

**LCD Connections**: The LCD (LM-5011N) can be connected to the system using appropriate cables and mounting hardware (MS-201). The setup allows for video output to be displayed on compatible screens.
