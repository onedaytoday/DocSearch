LW GN focuses on enhancing professional creativity through its diverse operational options, particularly in the cook & chill system designed for caterers. The B GN offers multiple operational modes, including convection cooking, enabling the preparation of items like meat and gratins without compromising quality. The steam function utilizes half-power settings, efficiently cooking food while minimizing preparation time and moisture loss. This dual-functionality supports various dishes, including pastries, and incorporates a "HOLD" feature for maintaining food temperature post-cooking. 

The system employs electronic controls for improved sanitation, including HACCP compliance for monitoring cooking parameters. Technical specifications reveal compatibility with LPG and features such as a thermo-glazed cooking chamber, ensuring uniform heat distribution and safety during operation, supported by IPX5 protection.

Available accessories include GN1/1 grids for whole chickens, frying baskets, water softeners, and various baking trays. Additional components consist of drain kits, exhaust hoods, grease collection systems, and heat shields, enhancing functionality and safety. The range also accommodates conversion kits for transitioning between LPG and natural gas and includes non-stick pans of varying sizes. Lastly, options like tray racks and wheel kits facilitate organized storage and mobility within the kitchen environment.
