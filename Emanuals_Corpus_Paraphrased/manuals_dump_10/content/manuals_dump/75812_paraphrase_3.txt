The operation of the four-star fresh food compartment relies on the thermostat settings. It manages the temperature to optimize food preservation. The thermostat can be adjusted to maintain ideal cooling conditions, typically set to activate and deactivate the system every few hours, ensuring that fresh food remains at the proper temperature. 

In extreme weather, the cooling system may run continuously, but if the thermostat is set too high, frequent defrosting can occur, which negatively impacts food quality. If the temperature rises above a certain threshold (around 16°C), it is important to switch off the unit to prevent food spoilage.

Please refer to the instruction manual for detailed guidance on thawing fresh food, technical specifications, shelf positioning, cleaning recommendations, and troubleshooting advice, along with service and customer support information.
