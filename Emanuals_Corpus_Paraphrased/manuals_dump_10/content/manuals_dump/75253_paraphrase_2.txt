### USING THE DEFROST FEATURE

Make sure to monitor the defrosting process, as the internal light will activate when the function is in use. It's important to note that the external temperature can affect the defrosting time. For quicker defrosting, particularly of meats, this function is useful. Always cook thoroughly immediately after defrosting, as bacteria can multiply rapidly in thawed foods.

### TIPS FOR BUYING AND PREPARING FOOD

When purchasing food, opt for the freshest items available and ensure they are insulated during transport. Always maintain proper food storage to prevent bacterial growth. Make sure to reheat thoroughly as per cooking instructions, and utilize a meat thermometer to ensure meats reach the appropriate internal temperatures (60°C, 70°C, 80°C) to be safe for consumption.
