### Customer Service and Purchase Information

For cleaning assistance or to purchase items, please contact Customer Services by phone or visit www.electrolux.co.uk. This document provides operational instructions for models Z4520 and Z4590, including cleaning procedures, maintenance, troubleshooting, and safety warnings.

### Safety Precautions

Before operation, ensure the cleaner is properly earthed. Avoid forcing the cover closed, as this can cause serious damage or void the warranty. Any repairs should be performed by authorized service personnel. Make sure to disconnect the cleaner from the power supply before cleaning or servicing.

### Operating Instructions

Ensure that the hose clicks securely into place before starting. To activate the cleaner, press the On/Off switch using your foot. For optimal performance, use the cleaner for suctioning dirt and debris from various surfaces, including carpets and upholstery.

### Dustbag Replacement

Replace the dustbag when it becomes full. To do this, detach the hose and cover. Always verify that both parts are in their proper position before proceeding. Dustbags should be checked every three months or when performance begins to decline.

### Cleaning the Hose and Nozzle

If airflow is restricted due to blockages, allow the hose to cool before addressing the obstruction. Regularly check the hose for any blockages that could reduce suction performance.

### Troubleshooting and Customer Information

If problems arise, verify that the cleaner is plugged into a functioning outlet and check for any blown fuses. If issues persist, contact authorized service personnel. For recycling information, refer to your local regulations or contact your purchase location.

### Electrical Supply Instructions

The cleaner should be connected to a power supply that meets the required specifications. Ensure all connections are secure and properly insulated. Follow the color-coding for the wires (brown for live, blue for neutral, green/yellow for earth) to avoid electrical hazards. 

### Warning

To minimize the risk of fire or electric shock, never allow children to use the vacuum as a toy, and always follow safety guidelines regarding attachments and cords. Turn off the device when not in use and ensure it remains free from obstructions.

### Warranty Information

This product is warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for one year from the date of purchase. To ensure coverage, follow the manufacturer's guidelines for proper use and maintenance.
