**TM and Water Note:** If the TM and Water system was purchased together, please refer to the following information. The water supply is typically located at the back right of the fresh food compartment, which should be turned off if necessary. The unit comes with a factory-installed housing and requires proper setup according to the guidelines provided by the retailer or Consumer Assistance. It may be helpful to verify compatibility when first using the RG-100 or NGRG-2000 models, both of which have been tested by NSF International to meet health and performance standards, specifically ANSI/NSF specifications. The rated capacity, service flow (GPM), and rated PSI should be adhered to, as well as regular maintenance every few months to ensure optimal operation. 

**Food Storage Recommendations:** For best results in the fresh food compartment, maintain temperatures around 34°F to 38°F, avoiding overcrowding on shelves, which may impede airflow and cooling. Meat should be securely wrapped to prevent cross-contamination and preserved freshness. Efficient storage involves utilizing airtight containers and ensuring items are compact to prevent freezer burn. Avoid placing hard-to-freeze foods on shelves that limit airflow.

**Energy Saving Suggestions:** Protect your unit from direct sunlight and minimize exposure to heat sources such as stoves and dishwashers. Ensure cabinetry is insulated to promote energy efficiency. Regularly check seals to prevent heat loss, and follow the provided cleaning instructions to maintain performance.

**Understanding Operational Sounds:** Some measurable sounds, stemming from high-efficiency operation, may be noticeable. Here are some common sounds: 

A. Air movement through the system. 
B. Forced air from the Toe Grill. 
C. Hissing or popping from the defrost heater. 
D. Clicking noises associated with on/off cycling. 
E. High-pitched sounds during operation. 
F. Fluid movement within the system.

**Cleaning Instructions:** Regular cleaning helps to reduce buildup. Use non-abrasive, household cleaners on the interior and exterior surfaces. When cleaning, follow guidelines to avoid scratching the finish, and always ensure the appliance is unplugged before cleaning, especially in high-risk areas such as the light cover. 

**Replacing Light Bulbs:** Use appropriate safety precautions when replacing light bulbs. Ensure the type matches the specifications of your appliance's light cover.
