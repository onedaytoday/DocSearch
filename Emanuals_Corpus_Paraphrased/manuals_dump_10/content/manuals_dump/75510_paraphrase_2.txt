The following guidelines outline how to effectively use cookware for optimal performance:

### Recommended Cookware
- **Match Food Quantity:** Ensure that the cookware you use can accommodate the amount of food being prepared. This will promote even cooking and heat transfer.
- **Select Appropriate Utensils:** Use utensils that do not scratch or damage the cookware. Cleaning is essential for maintaining performance, so follow the manufacturer's instructions closely.

### Using the Griddle
- Position the cookware correctly on the griddle by aligning it with the notches for best results. Always use potholders to avoid burns and ensure that your countertop can withstand high temperatures.

### Using the Wok Stand
- A wok with a round bottom should be placed on a wok stand to ensure proper stability. It is best to use flat-bottomed cookware for effective heat conduction and cooking performance. Ensure that the cookware is positioned correctly to prevent burns and maintain cooking efficiency.

### Using the Simmer Plate
- Utilize the simmer plate for low-temperature cooking. Make sure to adjust it correctly to maintain the desired heat level and to avoid burns. Allow the plate to cool down appropriately before handling.

### Surface Controls
- Adjust surface controls based on the type and amount of food being cooked. Pay attention to indicator lights to ensure the surface is ready for use. Always keep flammable items away from hot surfaces.

### Oven Use
- **Installing Racks:** Always position oven racks when the oven is cool. This ensures safety and efficiency. Arrange them properly to allow for optimal air circulation around the cookware.
- **Oven Functions:** Familiarize yourself with the different cooking functions available. Adjust settings appropriately from 170°F to 500°F depending on your cooking requirements. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature and monitor the LED indicator for readiness.

### Troubleshooting
- If you experience any issues with heat or cooking performance, verify that cookware and settings are appropriate for the food being prepared. Overcrowding your oven or improper preheating can lead to uneven cooking.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will ensure both safety and the best performance from your kitchen appliances and cookware.

### Convection Baking Instructions

When using **Convection Baking**, it is advisable to reduce the temperature by 25°F compared to traditional baking. The appliance's design includes a third heating element situated in the chamber, which circulates heat throughout, enhancing the cooking process. Foods can be cooked at temperatures ranging from 170°F to 500°F. 

For effective cooking, ensure the food is evenly placed to allow hot air to circulate around it. To begin, set the oven to **Convection** and select 350°F: the LED light will flash, indicating that it is preheating. Wait for the beep that signals the oven has reached 350°F. You can then continue cooking. When increasing the temperature from 350°F to 425°F, set the oven accordingly and wait for the beep at 425°F.

### Convection Roasting Instructions

**Convection Roasting** is excellent for achieving a perfectly seared and juicy finish to meats. The heat circulates around the food, ensuring even cooking. For poultry, the breast should be positioned correctly to maximize heat exposure. Always use a meat thermometer to check that the thickest part of the meat or thigh reaches the recommended internal temperature. Keep in mind the thermometer should be inserted without touching the bone. If readings are below the desired temperature, continue cooking the meat and check again.

### Broiling Instructions

**Broiling** utilizes high heat from the oven's top element, which is especially effective for meats. Preheating is necessary – switch to **Broil** until the heating element turns red-hot, which typically takes a few minutes. Season your food prior to broiling, and monitor it closely to avoid overcooking. 

Be cautious about grease buildup during broiling, as it can ignite. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; instead, use a fire extinguisher or smother the flames.

### Cleaning Instructions

For cleaning, avoid covering the oven with foil, as this may trap heat and prevent effective cleaning. After cooking, ensure the oven is turned off and cools down before cleaning. Use hot, soapy water and a cloth; materials that can withstand high cleaning temperatures are recommended. Follow specific cleaning instructions for various surfaces and utilize the self-clean feature with caution.

### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate the **Self-Clean** cycle, ensure the oven is cool, and turn the setting to Clean. The LED should flash during this process. The cycle typically lasts around 3 hours. Do not force the door open during this cycle, as it will lock automatically for safety. 

### Cleaning Tips for Range Cooktop

After using the range cooktop, ensure that it is off and cooled before cleaning. High-heat residue should be cleaned properly without using abrasive materials. For stubborn stains, full-strength cleaning agents may be applied as needed. Avoid thermal shock by gradually cooling hot surfaces.

These detailed instructions will ensure proper usage and maintenance for optimal performance of the convection oven and cooktop.

### Cleaning Stainless Steel Surfaces

Use the designated cleaner along with a lint-free cloth for stainless steel surfaces. **Important:** If using cleaners with chlorine compounds, ensure thorough application and follow with a lint-free cloth.  

### Cleaning Porcelain Grates

Clean porcelain grates using an appropriate cloth. Avoid harsh cleaners. For stubborn stains, a dishwasher can be utilized. **Important:** Do not apply heavy-duty cleaners or abrasive materials that could damage surfaces.

### Cleaning Knobs and Bezels

For optimal performance and longevity, use the specified method for cleaning knobs and bezels. Ensure proper cleaning of the plastic components, avoiding moisture on shafts.  

### Cleaning Burner Bases

Burner bases should be cleaned gently with a soft cloth. Thoroughly wipe the area to eliminate debris. 

### Cleaning Burner Rings

Ensure burner rings fit securely and are clean. To do this, position them against notches on the base. If needed, use a polishing compound for stubborn stains, and consult customer service for specific products.

### Cleaning Igniters

Igniters may accumulate food residue or grease. To prevent issues, homeowners should regularly clean them. Ensure they are cool before cleaning, and avoid water. Thoroughly clean around the igniter heads and base, being cautious to follow proper procedures.

### General Cleaning for Painted, Decorative, and Chrome Surfaces

Cleaning should only occur when the appliance is turned off and cool. Address spills and heavy soiling promptly. Regular cleaning will minimize the need for extensive future cleaning. Use a soft cloth for cleaning and do not apply abrasive cleaners that could damage finishes.

### Oven Light Maintenance

The oven light assembly includes a cover and operates on 120V AC. **Warning:** Ensure the light is cool and turned off before servicing to avoid injury. Always remove the cover straight from the housing, and check the bulb regularly.

### Common Issues and Solutions

- If the oven fails to heat, check power connections and settings.
- Regularly check the light operation and replace as needed.
- Ensure igniters are clean and functioning correctly.
