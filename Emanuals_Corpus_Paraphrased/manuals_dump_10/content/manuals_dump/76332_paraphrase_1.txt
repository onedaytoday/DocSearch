**Instructions for Operating the Washing Machine**

To select the desired washing settings, begin by pressing the TEMPERATURE button to choose from options including NIGHT WASH. Press the SPIN SPEED button multiple times to toggle through available SPIN SPEED or NIGHT WASH selections. If the NIGHT WASH option is active, the corresponding light will illuminate. For heavily soiled items, utilize the PREWASH function; for outdoor sports attire, select the OUTDOOR SPORTS setting. For lightly soiled items, choose the QUICK option. The SUPER RINSE or AA40 options can also be chosen based on the level of soil. Press the DELAY START button repeatedly to add a delay to the wash cycle; the chosen delay will flash momentarily before the countdown is initiated.

To start the washing process, press the START/PAUSE button. During operation, the START/PAUSE light will blink while the DOOR LOCKED indicator will illuminate, signifying the washing phase in progress. If the PAUSE function is needed, press the START/PAUSE button again; you can then press the SKIP/RESET button to exit to a different phase. The washing machine will cycle through its phases based on your selections.

For loading, it is advisable to sort items by fabric type—such as tablecloths, towels, aprons, and other textiles—and check for any damage like loose screws or buttons. Colored items should not be washed with whites to avoid discoloration, and bleach should only be used with caution and kept out of reach. Proper treatment of materials like wool is necessary; these may require specialized cleaning.

After the wash cycle completes, the machine will automatically unlock the door. The READY light will display indicating the end of the wash, after which you can open the door. If you need to switch off the machine for any reason, press the ON/OFF button and ensure the machine is not running. Unexpected interruptions can be resolved as described, and any irregularities in operation should be addressed.

**Usage Guidelines for Detergents and Conditioners**  
When selecting detergents, refer to recommended products for different fabric types, and ensure proper dosages are used according to load size and soil level. Use fabric conditioners as directed, and avoid overloading which can drastically affect wash results. 

For typical uses, adhere to standard laundry symbols regarding washing, drying, and bleaching. Refer to the labeled fabrics to determine appropriate washing settings such as temperature, spin speed, and cycle options.

**Regular Maintenance**  
To maintain optimal performance, routinely clean the lint filter and the washer drum. Inspect and clean hoses to ensure they are not clogged, which can impact washing efficiency. Always disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply when performing maintenance or troubleshooting.

**Troubleshooting**  
Should any issues arise concerning operation, refer to the error code guide for potential diagnoses. Common errors include E10 (water supply issues) and E20 (drainage issues). Follow the instructions to address these errors, ensuring the machine is properly connected and that hoses are positioned correctly.
