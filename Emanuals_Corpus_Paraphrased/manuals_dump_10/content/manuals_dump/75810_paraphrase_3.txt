## IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
Follow these guidelines to ensure safe use of the appliance. If you have questions, contact Customer Service. The appliance is heavy—exercise caution when moving it. It should only be serviced by authorized technicians to maintain safety and performance. Avoid placing the appliance near heat sources or exposing it to direct sunlight. Allow the appliance to stabilize for several hours before use. Its location should comply with the installation instructions to prevent ignition risks. 

Keep the appliance out of reach of children to avoid hazards such as suffocation. The cooling system requires professional servicing. Disconnect from the power supply before any maintenance, and avoid using detergents or abrasive cleaners on the interior as they can damage surfaces and leave strong odors. Clean the drainage trough to ensure unobstructed water flow.

## APPLIANCE DESCRIPTION
The appliance includes shelves for food storage, including options for fresh meat. The thermostat controls temperature settings and should be adjusted according to the ambient conditions and food storage requirements. Typical optimal settings allow for efficient cooling, and adjustments may be required during extreme weather conditions. Ensure that food is covered properly to maintain freshness.

## NORMAL SOUNDS
You may hear typical operating sounds, such as whirring from the cooling system or clicks from the thermostat. These are normal and indicate the appliance is functioning correctly.

## HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES
To prevent spoilage, regularly check that food is stored at appropriate temperatures, ideally around 7°C for perishables. Avoid placing hot food directly into the refrigerator to prevent temperature fluctuations, and ensure food is covered to avoid cross-contamination.

## DEFROSTING
To defrost the appliance, unplug it and allow ice buildup to melt naturally. Use a soft cloth to wipe away excess water during this process.

## MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING
Always disconnect the appliance from the power source before cleaning. Use only mild cleaning agents and avoid abrasive materials. It's advisable to clean the condenser and ensure proper airflow at least once a year. 

To replace the light bulb, switch off the power supply and carefully remove the light cover by unscrewing it.
