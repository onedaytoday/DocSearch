### III. Operating Instructions

#### General Information
The device is equipped with a meat and gas-heated option, combining smooth and grill plates for versatility. The operation includes a GN scraper and is managed via a dual switch system.

#### Igniting the Pilot Burner
Each switch is operated separately. To ignite the pilot burner, press the switch down and rotate it clockwise for a few seconds while continuing to hold it down. The burner should ignite within this period. If unsuccessful, repeat the process.

#### Igniting the Main Burner
To light the main burner, turn the control knob counterclockwise from the off position to the desired thermal rating.

#### Temperature Selection
The temperature ranges from 195°F to 570°F (90°C to 300°C), allowing you to adjust the cooking intensity from high to low.

#### Initial Operation
Before cooking, preheat the entire plate by allowing it to reach 320°F (160°C). 

#### Preheating
Ensure that the supply is connected for heating.

#### Cooking Guidelines
When cooking food, consider thickness: thin items cook at higher temperatures, while thicker items require lower settings. Adjust cooking times accordingly to achieve desired outcomes.

#### Collecting Liquids
Any liquids generated during cooking should be collected as needed.

#### Switching Off the Grill/Griddle Main Burner
To turn off, rotate the control knob clockwise back to the off position. This will extinguish the flame and stop gas flow.

#### Turning Off the Pilot Burner Flame
Press the pilot switch gently and rotate clockwise to turn it off. Ensure the flame is extinguished once heating has cooled down.

#### Long Shutdowns
For prolonged shutdown periods, disconnect the bottle or ensure the temperature remains above 32°F (0°C). Use a protective coating for maintenance.

#### Cleaning
Allow the device to cool before starting the cleaning process. Clean the griddle and all components with appropriate solutions, avoiding harsh chemicals that could degrade the surfaces. Regular cleaning prevents grease buildup and ensures efficient operation.

#### Malfunction
If the system does not heat properly, check if the thermal switch has tripped or if the air velocity is set too high. Contact customer service for assistance if defects are suspected.
