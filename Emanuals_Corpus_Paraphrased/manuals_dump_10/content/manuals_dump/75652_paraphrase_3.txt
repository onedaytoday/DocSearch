**Warning:** An acoustic alert will sound if the temperature is above the designated level. To mute the alert, press the ALARM OFF button. The warning system will deactivate automatically when the door is closed, and it will also turn off if the internal temperature falls below the set threshold. 

To power down the appliance, use the ON/OFF switch. The countdown from the current temperature will inform you when it is safe to disconnect. Ensure the appliance is completely shut off before unplugging it from the power source. Proper closure of the door is vital to prevent spoilage and avoid mold growth. 

Food should be stored correctly to maintain freshness. Adjust the shelving height as necessary, placing heavier bottles and groceries at the front for easier access. Ensure the airflow around the items is not obstructed to promote even cooling. 

For defrosting and cleaning, always disconnect the unit from the power supply first. Use appropriate cleaning methods, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the appliance. 

In the event of operation issues or alarm indications, refer to the troubleshooting section. Regular maintenance is recommended annually.
