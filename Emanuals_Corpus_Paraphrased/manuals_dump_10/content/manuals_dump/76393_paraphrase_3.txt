**Paraphrase:**

In order to maintain the appearance of various fabrics and household items, it's important to use the appropriate additives and detergents. Whites may require non-biological detergents like Fairy, while colored items and delicate fabrics should avoid bleach unless specially formulated for laundry. Heavy-duty stain removers, such as Vanish In-Wash and GloWhite, are suitable for tougher stains.

When choosing between traditional powders and liquids, either can be measured and added directly to the wash; compact versions should follow the specified instructions found on the packaging. Fabric conditioners can enhance the softness of easy-care fabrics and should be used as directed with the washer settings.

For drying, pay attention to the weight and material of items. Guidelines regarding drying times vary depending on fabric types; it’s crucial to ensure that items like towels are properly spun to avoid excess moisture. A consideration should also be given to potential creasing during drying.

To prevent overloading and ensure proper washing, follow the maximum load recommendations particularly with synthetic materials. If your washing machine has rinse hold or delay start options, utilize these settings carefully to manage the washing sequence. 

The control panel will have indicators for different functions, including spin speed, prewash, extra rinse, and selection for delicates or easy care. For maintenance, ensure that any build-up is cleaned from the machine, especially at connections like hoses. If issues arise, troubleshooting is advised by following the signals from the machine's display and considering manual adjustments.

Always refer to the operational guidance specific to your model when encountering problems. If error codes appear, they can indicate supply issues or improper closure of door components, which may require cleaning or resetting.
