**Cookware Guidelines**

The type of cookware and its condition are essential for optimal cooking performance. Ensure that the cookware makes proper contact with the heating element, as shown in the diagrams provided. Cookware should be flat and compatible with the heating system to promote even heat distribution. It's best to avoid using warped cookware that deviates more than half an inch from flatness, as this can affect cooking efficiency. 

When using cookware, if scratches or damage occur, address these immediately as they can impact heat transfer. The cooking surface should be smooth to facilitate easy cleanup. It's important to select cookware that matches the specifications to avoid overheating issues. 

For effective heating, consider the size of the cookware compared to the burner, ensuring there’s no blockage of the venting systems. The Wave-Touch controls provide visual indicators for each heating element, including options to turn the heat on and off. Adjustments can be made easily through the LED display. 

For optimal results, use the recommended heat settings for different food types, as indicated in the provided chart. This will ensure even cooking and minimize the risk of burning. 

**Preheating Instructions**

Preheating is a feature used to reach specific temperatures before cooking. Depending on your cooking requirements, select the appropriate preheat setting—350°F (176°C), 170°F (77°C), or 550°F (288°C)—and follow the prompts on the display. 

While preheating, monitoring the process is crucial. If needed, you can cancel the preheating by following the on-screen instructions. Upon completion, the system will indicate readiness for cooking, ensuring food is placed correctly in the oven. 

**Cooking Optimization**

For effective cooking, especially with thicker food items, it's important to manage heat levels carefully. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water—use an appropriate extinguisher. Use the specified settings for cooking various types of meat and adjust according to the guidelines provided for preheating and cooking times.

Continuous monitoring and making adjustments as necessary will enhance cooking performance. Following the recommended practices when utilizing different cooking modes, including convection settings, will also help achieve the best results. 

When using the convection option, note that it circulates heat effectively, allowing food to cook evenly. Similar to standard cooking methods, specific temperatures apply. Ensure you understand how to operate the controls and adjust as needed based on the guidelines provided.

**Convection Cooking Overview**

This feature enables the use of the Convection Bake function for optimal food performance. When cooking various dishes, it’s essential to preheat the oven to approximately 350°F (176°C) before beginning. Press the UPPER OVEN button, then CONV BAKE, followed by START. The display will indicate PRE-HEATING until the desired temperature is reached. You have the option to cancel at any time during the cooking process.

**Using the Perfect Convection Function**

The Perfect Convection setting is ideal for roasting meats and poultry, providing even heating around the food. This method can help reduce cooking time while enhancing flavor. It is crucial to refer to the Conv Roast Chart for appropriate cooking times and temperatures.

**Roasting Instructions**

Ensure proper placement of the roasting pan to catch grease and facilitate even cooking. Secure the food to avoid overcrowding. Monitor cooking times to prevent over-browning, and again refer to the Convection Roasting Chart for guidance.

**Internal Temperature Checks**

To verify that meat is thoroughly cooked, it is necessary to measure the internal temperature, which should reach specific benchmarks: 170°F (76°C) for poultry and certain cuts of meat. Use a probe to ensure the thickest part of the meat reaches the appropriate temperature without touching bone.

**Using the Slow Cook Function**

The Slow Cook feature is designed for low and slow cooking, ideal for roasts and casseroles. Ensure food is completely thawed, and follow recommended cooking times based on the selected temperature settings. When activated, select the UPPER or LOWER oven, choose SLOW COOK, set your desired temperature, and press START.

**Defrosting Foods**

To defrost, use the DEFROST setting which effectively circulates warm air around the food. This setting is suitable for meats and other items but ensure proper monitoring to maintain food safety.

**Bread Proofing**

For yeast-leavened products, use the BREAD PROOF function at a temperature of approximately 85°F (30°C) to allow for adequate rising. Activate this by pressing the UPPER OVEN button, selecting BREAD PROOF, and then START.

**Favorite Cooking Settings**

To simplify cooking, navigate your favorite settings by selecting MY FAVORITE. You can recall or overwrite existing preferences by pressing the appropriate buttons and following on-screen prompts. 

**Note on Food Safety**

Follow all food safety guidelines to prevent foodborne illnesses, ensuring foods are cooked to the correct internal temperature and handled properly. Always refer to the provided charts for specific cooking times and temperatures for various foods.

Each cooking function allows for versatility in preparing a variety of dishes. To utilize the Bake/Conv feature, set the temperature between 350°F and 500°F (170°C to 260°C). Follow these steps: press the UPPER OVEN button, then MULTI STAGE, followed by BAKE F, and finally START. For Broil, press START after selecting the desired settings. To commence cooking immediately, ensure you press START with the appropriate instructions.

**Notes**: To cancel any input, press the CANCEL button. The MULTI STAGE option can be accessed only once. 

During the Sabbath or holidays, certain features, including heating and cooking modes, are adjusted. Initially select BAKE and the desired cooking mode. The COOK TIME option may be set, and factory defaults display the last set time and temperature. Once the oven light is active, it cannot be turned off until cooking concludes. 

To maintain safety when cooking, avoid placing foil in the oven or covering racks with foil, as this could cause hazards. Always keep children at a safe distance from the lower oven when it is hot to prevent burns. 

For optimal results, adhere to recommended heating settings based on food types, avoiding prolonged exposure to temperatures under 170°F (76°C) to prevent food poisoning. If a fire occurs, use a fire extinguisher and turn off the oven immediately.

This appliance features precise temperature settings to accommodate various cooking needs. In the event of self-cleaning being activated or interruptions occurring during the Sabbath, ensure you follow the guidelines thoroughly to maintain safety and efficiency.

**Preferences**: The Wave-Touch interface allows users to adjust settings conveniently. To change the clock or temperature units, access USER PREF and follow prompts for options.

**Self-Cleaning**: The self-cleaning function uses high heat to eliminate residues, ensuring the cavity, racks, and surfaces are clean. Always remove racks before starting self-cleaning and refrain from using abrasive cleaners or coatings that could damage the oven. The high temperatures reached during self-cleaning can be hazardous, so ensure safety measures are in place. 

In summary, for using the oven, familiarize yourself with the cooking features, temperatures, safety precautions, and maintenance protocols to ensure effective and safe operation.
