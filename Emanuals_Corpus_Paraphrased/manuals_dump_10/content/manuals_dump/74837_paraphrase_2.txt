To initiate cooking, switch the (LS) off to extinguish it and turn the (H) off as an optional step. After cooking is completed, turn off the (H). The function buttons (TT), (DT), and (ZT) will remain active after switching off the (S). Once the (S) is turned off, all previous cooking functions will also cease. If the supply switch is disconnected, press the Soft (R) to minimize the heat for the food. The (LR) indicator will turn on, while the following will be activated: the displays show food (AT) and (AD), confirming cooking completion through an acoustic signal. For troubleshooting, see the relevant section. Normally, the SOFT function is deactivated; it heats food at the quickest rate, especially for items with high thermal conductivity, to prevent burning. When activated, the heating adapts to the type of food, ensuring proper cooking without sticking issues. The CLOCK TIME (AZ) displays the current time while (AT) shows the status when the switch (S) is engaged.

**Operating Instructions for HACCP Appliances**: The device can analyze cooking processes with the THERMACAM system as part of HACCP compliance. The (C) indicator will light up; turning the (Z) switch will initiate the cooking process, as indicated by (AT) and (AD). Cooking can be stopped by pressing the HACCP (C), which will then deactivate all functions. To optimize functionality, manipulate the function buttons (T), (D), and (Z) as necessary. If cooking remains active for several seconds, the (TT) switch can be turned off anytime during the heating/cooking process. 

To manually engage cooling, the switch (DT) should be utilized. The system can be manually switched when cooking is complete to initiate cooling. The procedure for cooling involves deactivating the (TT) and pressing (V), causing the cooling indicator (LV) to flash. The cooling process can be completed by acknowledging (V) again.

**Mechanical Tilting**: When switching from the (S) position, turning clockwise activates the function, while turning left directs material to the outlet. It is essential that the machine is secured before continuing. After adjusting, the switch (K) should only be released once it self-locks. The user interface is designed for ease of operation, providing options for both low and high-temperature cooking, with specific settings like pressure cooking at 394°F (200°C).

**Important Information**: Operating with steam requires proper closure of all outlets to avoid splashing during cooking. The equipment includes various GN trays and can handle different types of food efficiently. Consistently maintain locking mechanisms during cooking to prevent burns. The SOFT function assists in controlling cooking rates, particularly for frothy foods. 

For meat, a roasting temperature of 391°F (200°C) followed by simmering at lower temperatures is recommended. Steaming poultry should initially be conducted at higher temperatures (284°F to 320°F / 140°C to 160°C) and then reduced. Ensure to monitor and adjust cooking methods according to the food type while adhering to safety guidelines. Proper handling of the release controls is crucial to ensure that food is cooked safely without risk of spills. 

The cooking instructions outline various methods including roasting, steaming, and pressure cooking, detailed for optimal results specific to food types.

**Operating Instructions for Cooking Equipment**

**Cooking Process**: Ensure proper cooking by following the established protocols. Preheat the equipment to 302°F (150°C) and utilize a perforated GN pan to facilitate uniform heat distribution. Cooking results can vary based on several factors, including the configuration and type of ingredients used. Adjust the cooking ratio accordingly to meet the desired food quality and quantity.

**Cleaning Procedure**: Always switch off the equipment and allow it to cool before cleaning. Use non-abrasive cloths to remove grease and food residues, avoiding cleaning agents that could damage surfaces. Regular cleaning after each cooking session is crucial to prevent malfunctions. Use brushes or cloths designated for cleaning to maintain hygiene without risking equipment integrity.

**Troubleshooting**: In the event of operational issues, such as abnormal acoustic signals or error codes (E1, E2, etc.), acknowledge the alarms by pressing (Q) and consult the service manual for further instructions. Ensure the equipment is disconnected from the power supply when performing diagnostics.

**HACCP Compliance**: Maintain food safety standards by adhering to HACCP guidelines, including monitoring potential hazards linked to cooking processes. Ensure easy access for cleaning and maintenance to prevent the accumulation of grease and residual materials.

**Recommended Cleaning Practices**: When using high-heat or acidic cleaning substances, take care to protect the equipment from mechanical damage. Regular inspections and cleaning following established regulations are essential to ensure safe and effective operation. Avoid using harmful cleaning methods that could lead to equipment degradation.

Please ensure adherence to these instructions to maintain optimal cooking equipment performance.
