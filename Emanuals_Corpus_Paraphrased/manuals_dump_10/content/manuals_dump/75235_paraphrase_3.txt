**Convection Baking Instructions:**

For optimal results when baking items such as cakes, pastries, or breads with yeast, it is crucial to preheat the oven to the recommended temperature. Avoid using high shelf settings that can cause uneven cooking or overbaking. Ensure that the cake batter is evenly distributed and the baking tray is properly greased to prevent sticking.

**Roasting Guidelines:**

Utilize the roasting function for meats and other dishes, referring to the specific roasting chart for guidance on cooking times and temperatures. Be mindful of the meat's thickness and monitor closely to avoid burning. Make necessary adjustments to the heat settings based on cooking progress.

**Defrosting Function:**

For defrosting, remove packaging and place food on the designated shelf. Avoid covering food during the process to ensure thorough defrosting. Foods such as meats or cream should be turned periodically for uniform defrosting.

**Drying Function:**

Use the drying function for items like beans and fruits, ensuring they are placed on greaseproof shelves. The food should not touch to guarantee even drying.

Before cleaning, ensure the oven is turned off and cooled. Avoid using abrasive materials that could scratch surfaces. Follow instructions for cleaning specific parts, including the light fixture and heating elements, to maintain safety and functionality.
