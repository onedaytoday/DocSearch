For stubborn stains, it is essential to wash the items promptly. Use a fresh cloth, applying the appropriate grease treatment based on the fabric type, and select either hot or cold water. When using bleach, adhere strictly to the guidelines for whites and colored fabrics. Stains like lipstick can be treated with bleach, ensuring the fabric is compatible, and remember to wash thoroughly afterward.

Select a suitable washing program based on the fabric type, typically around 60°C. Additives such as starch can enhance performance, so choose these based on your needs. Make sure to follow all instructions for water temperature and detergent selection to ensure optimal cleaning results.

When washing various fabrics, adjustments might be required. For delicates like wool, opt for a handwash or gentle cycle, while synthetic fabrics may require a different setting. Always select appropriate spin settings and consider options like a night cycle to minimize noise.

Ensure that the washing machine remains clean and well-maintained by routinely cleaning the lint filter and drainage system, and the exterior surfaces. Should you encounter any malfunctions such as clogging or unusual noises, please consult the troubleshooting guide thoroughly.

For installation and operational efficiency, connect the washing machine to a dedicated power supply, ensuring proper earthing and compliance with local electrical codes. It’s crucial that hoses are installed without kinks and that the water supply is adequate.

For built-in installations, confirm that positioning allows for safe clearance around all hoses and components, avoiding any potential damage or obstruction.

Refer to the technical rating and specifications chart to select the correct water supply parameters and cycle settings based on fabric care requirements. Follow all guidelines carefully to guarantee longevity and performance of the appliance.

To attach component A to component B, use the provided screws. Ensure that the thickness of component C matches the requirements for screw B, as well as for screw D. Proper alignment is crucial for the effective operation of the assembly. If adjustment is needed, verify that the plates and mounting plate are correctly situated. 

For the installation of the countermagnet and when integrating the system, ensure that the mounting height complies with specifications and that all components are secured with four fixing screws in the correct positions to allow for proper alignment with the plinth at the front.

The four countersunk screws should be installed at the designated points, allowing for adequate clearance at the top. To ensure security, direct the screws towards the front. If you need to transfer this appliance between countries, refer to local guidelines, as the device may be treated differently based on its country of origin. For disposal, follow the recycling instructions provided by local authorities or the retailer.

Typically, appliances can be loaded without prewashing, provided that they are free from large residues. For customer inquiries, please reach out to Customer Service at the specified numbers or visit our website for support.
