**Defrosting Guidelines**  
To defrost the unit, remove any frost buildup when it’s powered off. Frost can accumulate on the covers, and regular cleaning of these surfaces is essential to maintain performance. **Warning!** Ensure the unit is unplugged before cleaning to avoid electric shock. Use a damp cloth with a suitable cleaning agent to wipe down the surfaces. The food should be kept covered to maintain its cool temperature.

Make sure to switch off the power or unplug the unit during cleaning to prevent any shock hazards. After cleaning, ensure everything is fully dried before powering on again.

When looking for malfunctions, refer to the following troubleshooting steps. If the appliance cools excessively or too little, this may indicate a blown fuse or operational issue. Food may be frostbitten if maintained at suboptimal temperatures, and adjustments may need to be made accordingly. Use the warmer switch if necessary, and consult the manual for further instructions.

The **COOLMATIC** function can also be activated or deactivated manually. **Warning!** Always switch off the power supply before handling any electrical components to avoid shock. If the light associated with the COOLMATIC function is not operating correctly, refer to the operational instructions for addressing this issue.

During normal operations, you may hear clicks as switches activate. Bubbling or splashing sounds may also occur due to the circulation of fluids inside the unit. These sounds are considered normal; however, if they occur excessively, consult the troubleshooting guide.

This appliance complies with all relevant EU regulations regarding safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), including directives 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG. 

Regarding cooling efficiency, the unit is designed to transfer heat away from stored food to maintain low temperatures. This heat is expelled through vents typically located at the back or sides of the unit. Proper installation and positioning are crucial for optimal cooling performance.
