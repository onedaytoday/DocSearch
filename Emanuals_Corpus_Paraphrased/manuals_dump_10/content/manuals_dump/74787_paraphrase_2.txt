To ensure proper ventilation, the food storage location must be kept clear of heat sources and direct sunlight. Food should be stored properly to prevent spoilage and ensure safety. Certain foods, particularly those that are cooked or tightly sealed in containers, can lead to increased internal pressure, posing a risk of bursting. It's important to maintain adequate space around food items and to avoid obstruction.

When handling fire extinguishers or other emergency equipment, make sure to follow specified guidelines to prevent ignition or damage. Disconnect from the electrical supply and handle food preparations safely to avoid accidents. 

Food should be covered with suitable materials, like polythene wrap, and kept clean. Onions and garlic should be stored in airtight containers to maintain freshness. The appliance’s rating indicates the capacity for fresh food storage, typically within specified hours, and it's crucial to manage this capacity diligently. 

For shelf installation, follow the instructions provided, ensuring screws are properly secured. Adjust shelf heights uniformly to facilitate optimal storage. The internal temperature should be monitored to ensure food remains below 0°C to maintain freshness. 

Proper waste disposal in accordance with regulations is essential. Appliances should be operated according to the manufacturer's instructions to prevent malfunctioning. If issues arise, seek assistance from qualified professionals rather than attempting repairs independently.
