### Instruction A-10.2 Active

For theater setups, set up the following components: the main unit and/or a VCR. It is essential for optimal sound that the audio aligns with the visual content. The system must effectively transmit sound from the right side to enhance the overall experience. It uses amplifiers to create a robust home theater sound environment, which integrates both front and surround audio channels. The system distinguishes itself through surround sound capabilities, accurately positioning sounds like effects and crashes.

The active subwoofer should be connected to the setup for enhanced bass output. Ensure that the subwoofer is properly linked to the right audio channels, and take care to adjust the connection cords accordingly to optimize performance. The phase controls on the subwoofer are important for balancing sound; incorrect settings can result in reduced bass response.

When positioning the subwoofer, avoid placing it in corners as this may adversely affect sound quality. The built-in amplifier in the subwoofer also plays a critical role in managing bass frequencies.

**Warning!** To prevent electric shock or malfunction, do not cover or obstruct the subwoofer. Follow all operating and service instructions carefully for safety.

**Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues with sound output, ensure that all connections are secure and that the unit is powered on. For any persistent problems, refer to the troubleshooting guide or seek professional service.
