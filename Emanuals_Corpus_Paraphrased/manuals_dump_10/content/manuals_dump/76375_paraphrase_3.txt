Hereâ€™s a paraphrased version of the text in a natural, technical manner, preserving the original meaning:

For washing various items, it is important to select the appropriate cycle and options. Use the Refresh setting for items that are lightly soiled or need minimal washing, such as synthetics or delicates. The ECO setting is designed for lightly soiled whites and colors, and you can choose to turn off certain options if necessary.

Ensure proper sorting of laundry: separate whites from colored items, synthetics from delicates, and wash heavily soiled items separately. Washing pillowcases and shirts together with whites is acceptable, provided they are treated appropriately before washing. 

For stubborn stains, pre-treat items with suitable methods overnight and use cold water with a compatible stain remover. Also, bleach can be used for whites and light colors, but always follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Regular maintenance of the washing machine is essential. Disconnect it from the power supply for safety during cleaning, and ensure that all components are properly maintained and checked as per the guidelines to prevent malfunctions.  

If issues arise, such as a blocked hose or improper connections, address these immediately by examining the filters and the drainage system. Any obstructions should be cleared for effective operation.

All washing parameters, including maximum load quantities and temperatures, should be adhered to according to the specifications provided. If the functionality fails, refer to the service manual for troubleshooting guidance.

Ensure that the hoses are correctly installed to avoid leaks or damage. This involves securely attaching hoses and avoiding twisting or kinking, which could impede water flow. 

Finally, make sure to refer to the technical chart provided for appropriate temperature settings and type classifications for washing different fabrics. Use caution while handling the equipment, maintaining cleanliness, and following recommended safety procedures when operating the machine.

This version retains the technical nature of the original content while organizing it in a more coherent manner.

The hose connected to the service should facilitate a single-phase supply to V. The responsibility for compliance with this requirement lies with the other party, ensuring that the switch type and its earthing are appropriate for the electricity supply. This supply should be straightforward to replace when necessary. All parties involved must be properly authorized within the respective country, and the equipment should be treated as household waste for recycling purposes. For additional information on recycling, please consult your local city office, household service, or the point of purchase. Typically, pre-washing is not required, and items should be loaded as indicated, ensuring they are adequately cleaned thereafter.
