Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text while preserving the original meaning:

When positioning the washer-dryer, ensure that the hoses are not impeded and maintain proper clearance for operation. The water supply hose should be securely threaded and appropriately connected to the supply line. If the hose is too short, acquire a replacement that meets local authority and building specifications. The connection should allow for operational functionality; if there is a leak, it must be addressed immediately.

The installation process includes using the supplied U-shaped hose. The hose should have a clearance of approximately 10 cm from the floor. Ensure not to cover the hose with carpeting or similar materials to prevent degradation. The washer-dryer unit must be properly plumbed and connected to the drainage system according to applicable regulations.

In terms of electrical connections, ensure the unit is grounded. The power supply specifications should match the indicated ratings. Conductors are color-coded: typically, brown is for live (L), blue is for neutral (N), and green/yellow for earth. If repairs are necessary, use qualified personnel to avoid serious electrical hazards.

For assembly, secure the unit using the provided screws, ensuring there is no trapping of hoses. The mounting height should be adjusted based on specific configurations of the installation site. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for proper height and stability.
