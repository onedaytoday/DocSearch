This operating manual provides essential information for selecting and using your appliance over the years.

For models WRM2000_A-R and WRM3500_A-R, ensure that the compartment's cube shelf is positioned properly. The screws should be adjusted so that the front is slightly elevated compared to the back. Maintain a minimum clearance from the wall at the back to allow airflow and avoid exposure to sunlight and heat sources. Use a separate outlet with 230V AC, and ensure it is properly grounded (Green/yellow wire), following the instructions on the back panel to avoid electrical hazards.

Keep the interior clean with a cloth; utilize the scraper for any buildup. Adjust the thermostat to the desired setting and allow the unit to acclimate fully. Regularly check for frost accumulation and perform maintenance as needed. If performance issues arise, consult the authorized service provider.

To prepare ice cubes, turn the thermostat adequately to ensure they freeze thoroughly. Fresh food should be placed at the front, while other items can be stored at the back. Ensure all items are properly wrapped or stored in airtight containers to maintain freshness.

Defrosting is necessary when frost builds up excessively (more than one inch). Remove frost using the scraper periodically during normal operation. If frost accumulation is significant, perform a full defrost cycle. During defrosting, detach the DRAIN CAP from the DRAIN BULB as indicated, and replace it once completed.

Regular cleaning is advised every month or after major frost buildup, using appropriate cloths and solutions to avoid contamination or damage. Handle the unit carefully to prevent scratches or malfunctions, adhering to all safety guidelines while relocating or servicing.

Ensure there are no obstructions blocking the back of the appliance, as this can impair the insulation and mechanical performance. Should symptoms of malfunction arise or if the appliance operates unusually (e.g., excessive sounds or temperatures), please contact the vendor or service provider.
