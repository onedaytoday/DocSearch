**F4VA1 System Overview**

**Programming Section:**  
The F4VA1 system supports various functions including manual controls, programming, and exclusions. To adjust settings, utilize the following layout: the programming section enables modifications of steam settings from a minimum to a specified duration in seconds. The buttons for MIX and PAUSE are displayed as two-digit indicators. To initiate programming, press the PROG button, which will cause the PROG and STEAM indicators to flash. Use the associated buttons to increase or decrease the selected settings, and confirm each change with the PROG button. Pressing PROG again will allow you to toggle between steaming and other options, indicated by the corresponding lights.

**Manual Controls:**  
The AIR function can be activated with a single press to initiate blowing operations, while the MIX STEAM operation can be triggered as necessary. The REPEAT CYCLE feature allows for repeated operations without further input, while the MANUAL END option enables immediate cessation of operations. The function can be turned off or manually controlled as required.

**Exclusion Section:**  
This section includes buttons with LEDs that denote the exclusion of specific functions. If a function is deemed excluded, the front LED will indicate this status clearly. 

**Counter Features:**  
The system includes counters that log the duration of various processes, displayed through relevant indicators like STEAM, MIX, PAUSE, and AIR. If counters reach set thresholds, corresponding alerts will appear on the display panel.

**Warnings and Maintenance:**  
Regular cleaning and maintenance are emphasized. Use a cloth for cleaning. Ensure that connections and cabling are free from damage and follow guidelines for operational safety. 

**Troubleshooting:**  
In case of malfunctions, a troubleshooting table is provided to identify issues. The display will show error codes that guide you toward resolution steps. Always refer to authorized technicians for service to avoid risks associated with electrical components.

**Decommissioning and Recycling:**  
When decommissioning, follow procedures to ensure safety and environmental compliance. Disconnect from power and follow local regulations for recycling of the materials involved, contributing to sustainability efforts.
