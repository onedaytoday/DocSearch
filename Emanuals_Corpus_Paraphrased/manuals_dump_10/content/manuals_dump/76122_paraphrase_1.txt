### Installation Instructions for the Cooker Hood

**Mounting Height:** The cooker hood should be installed at a height indicated in the diagram below, based on the reference specifications provided for proper positioning.

**Hardware Installation:** Use the screws provided to secure the unit. Ensure the screws are tightened sufficiently to avoid any looseness, while also connecting the outlet properly. If the mounting surface is hollow or made of drywall, additional support may be necessary.

**Ducting Options:** For optimal performance, the hood should be ducted externally. Adhere to British standards or DIN 4102-B1 when selecting ducting materials. Charcoal filters can be utilized if external ducting is not feasible. Ensure that the ducting leads to the appropriate outlet, which should be positioned vertically.

**Chimney Assembly:** The installation involves both an upper and lower chimney section. Adjust the position as necessary for proper alignment with the ducting outlet. Secure both chimney sections using the screws provided.
