**Important Instructions and Safety Information**

This guide should be kept for future reference. If ownership changes, it's essential that the new owner is informed about the operation and maintenance of the appliance. 

**Child Safety Precautions**
Children should not be allowed to operate the appliance unsupervised. It is crucial to keep children away from the unit while it is in use and ensure the area around it is clear. 

**Material Care**
Certain materials, such as clothing with screws or buttons, should not be washed in this appliance. Use appropriate cleaning products, and be cautious of how items are treated to avoid potential damage.

**Operating Instructions**
For optimal performance, select options based on fabric type and load. Use the Quick option for lightly soiled items, adjusting the load to prevent overuse of electricity. If laundry is unevenly distributed, it may need to be manually re-centered. If issues arise, refer to the "Something Not Working" section.

**Recycling and Disposal**
If the appliance needs to be disposed of, contact your local council for recycling instructions. Ensure the appliance is correctly treated as household waste, and follow local guidelines to avoid health hazards.

**Control Panel Overview**
- The drying light indicates the status of the drying cycle.
- The prewash function can be used as needed.
- The child-proof lock feature can be activated to prevent unauthorized use.

**Washing Programs**
- For white cotton at 95°C, measure the load properly. 
- Use the SPIN REDUCTION or QUICK WASH as necessary.
- Mixed fabrics at 50°C should also be measured carefully for proper wash performance.

**Drying Options**
Select the appropriate drying options based on fabric types and weights. Monitor the operation lights for status updates.

For any further assistance with the washer-dryer, consult the instruction manual or contact service support. Proper usage and adherence to these guidelines will enhance performance and longevity.

**Laundry Care Instructions**

When selecting laundry products, it's important to choose the right detergents for different fabric types and colors. For whites, use non-biological detergents like Fairy, which are ideal for cleaning whites as well as colored garments. Delicate items should be washed with bleach alternatives specifically designed for their care. 

For traditional laundry, you may opt for powders or liquids, taking care to follow the measurements indicated on the packaging. For effective washing, utilize fabric conditioners as per the guidelines provided on the product label. This helps maintain fabric quality and reduces synthetic wear.

Additionally, for heavy items like towels and sheets, ensure the appropriate wash settings are selected, and be aware of temperature recommendations (e.g., 60°C for whites) in relation to EEC directives.

To prevent operation issues, always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply when not in use. Regular maintenance is also crucial; check for lint in the filter and ensure hoses are clear to avoid blockages.

If any problems arise, such as poor wash quality or operational failures, refer to the troubleshooting section for guidance. You can also contact Service Force for assistance or more information about your appliance.

**Technical Specifications:**

- **Power Supply:** Check voltage and amperage requirements.
- **Water Pressure:** Adhere to the maximum recommended water pressure for optimal performance.
- **Capacity:** Review the maximum load capacity for different fabric types (synthetics, wool, cotton).
- **Spin Speed:** Pay attention to the spin speed settings for various wash cycles to ensure effective drying.

Always follow manufacturer recommendations to avoid damage to fabrics and ensure efficient operation of your washing machine.

Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text, retaining the original meaning:

During the unpacking process, ensure that the hoses are not pinched against the back. Remove screws affixed to the polythene and set them aside alongside the previously removed screws. Keep the unit upright while extracting the three spacers that were previously installed. Ensure that the positioning does not obstruct any hoses or disrupt plumbing connections, as this unit can be permanently connected to existing supply lines. The hoses, which include both hot and cold options, are equipped with BSP threads. If there are any issues with compatibility, consult local plumbing suppliers or a qualified plumber.

To connect the water supply, ensure the hoses are correctly positioned and aligned. It is essential that the installation complies with relevant building regulations and authority guidelines.

If plumbing into the mains supply is not feasible, utilize the supplied hoses for proper setup. The internal configuration should be verified to prevent restrictions in water flow. The fitting of the hose to the service outlet must include washers for secure attachment, which will help prevent leaks.

Take note: This appliance must be properly earthed to avoid electrical hazards. The power supply should match the ratings indicated on the appliance's label. The wiring colors must correspond correctly: Earth (green/yellow), Neutral (blue), and Live (brown or red). If electrical components need replacing or servicing, ensure that the power supply is turned off and all work is conducted according to safety standards.

When building this appliance into cabinetry, follow the specified dimensions and handle the hoses carefully to avoid kinks or obstructions. Assemble it according to the instructions, ensuring the screws are tightened to secure the appliance in place. Adjust the mounting plates as necessary to achieve the correct height, allowing sufficient space for ventilation and access.

Finally, ensure that all four fixing screws are installed correctly to maintain stability. Observance of the specific clearance dimensions will help prevent operational issues and guarantee secure installation. If adjustments are needed, verify that all components align properly with minimal obstruction.
