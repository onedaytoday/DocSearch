Here’s a refined and technical paraphrase of the provided text:

When cooking meat, utilizing high heat (between 300°F and 550°F) effectively browns the exterior and provides an appealing appearance. Preheat the broiler to around 550°F to enhance the cooking process. Season the food as desired, and remember to turn it occasionally for even cooking. The high temperature helps to render excess grease, but caution must be exercised to prevent grease fires. Always monitor the cooking process, particularly when using the broiler, as thick food items can ignite. In case of fire, use a fire extinguisher rather than water.

For convection cooking, which operates efficiently between 170°F and 550°F (optimal at 350°F), ensure the oven is preheated. This method circulates hot air, allowing for more uniform cooking, which is beneficial for thicker foods. The cooking times may need adjustment based on the type and amount of food being prepared.

When roasting poultry or meat, convection roasting operates at similar temperature ranges, typically focusing on 350°F to 400°F. Ensure the roasting pan is positioned correctly to facilitate even heating and browning. Always safeguard against grease fires by not covering the food improperly or leaving it unattended.

For warm-keeping, set the oven to 170°F to 190°F, which is suitable for gradually reheating foods. This technique is also effective for bread proofing, activating yeast at a range of 85°F to 100°F.

Important features include user preferences for cooking settings and the ability to retain settings for future use. A Sabbath mode includes specific functions that restrict certain actions during operation. 

For further operational instructions, consult the specific sections for each cooking mode, ensuring safe and efficient use of the appliance.

**Preferences for Clock Settings and Operation**  
To adjust the clock or operating hours, first, press the USER PREF button to access the ClO setting. In the event of a power interruption, the clock will flash to indicate that it requires an update. Follow the prompts displayed, then select either HI or LO to set the desired hours. Once adjustments are made, press START to confirm and return to standby mode. To restore factory settings, press USER PREF and select rSt, then press START.

**Self-Cleaning Procedure**  
Before initiating a self-clean cycle, ensure the oven is cool and has been emptied of any debris or heavy soiling. Always wear protective gear when performing manual cleaning, and avoid using harsh chemicals or scourers that may damage surfaces. To activate self-cleaning, close the door, select the desired cleaning duration, and press START. Once completed, the door will remain locked until the oven cools. Do not force open the door during this period, as high temperatures are involved.

**Regular Cleaning Maintenance**  
For optimal performance, promptly remove spills and heavy soiling. Regular cleaning reduces the frequency of deep cleans. Use gentle cleaners on painted and decorative surfaces, avoiding abrasive materials. Ensure that the oven is off and cool before cleaning, and refer to the specific guidelines outlined for each surface type.

**Preheating Guidelines**  
For optimal cooking results, preheat the oven as necessary, particularly when baking bread or cakes. Ensure there is adequate space around dishes to prevent overcrowding and heat loss. Follow recommended temperature settings and avoid placing items that require differing cooking times in the oven simultaneously. For assistance, refer to the cooking chart or service contact information provided.
