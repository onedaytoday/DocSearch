**Information Overview:**  
Thank you for choosing this beverage center. This guide is intended to facilitate your usage, care, and maintenance of the unit. Please ensure you read the instructions thoroughly to avoid any issues during installation or use. Adherence to these guidelines is your responsibility, and any damages from improper installation or use may not be covered under warranty. For assistance, refer to the troubleshooting section or visit www.electroluxappliances.com. Important warranty details can be found on the Product Card, located at the top of the unit.

**Safety Precautions:**  
Follow all safety warnings to prevent risk of injury or death. Ensure the unit is securely installed in a location free from obstructions, allowing proper air circulation. Disconnect the power supply when cleaning or adjusting the unit, and make sure that shelves do not easily detach.

**Installation Guidelines:**  
For both freestanding and built-in installations, maintain a clearance of at least one inch around the unit to facilitate adequate airflow. Ensure the grounding system is properly connected to prevent electrical hazards. Do not bypass safety features, and if needed, consult a professional installer.

**Operation Instructions:**  
The unit arrives with the cooling function enabled. Check that the “On/Off” setting is correctly configured. Activation is indicated by a tone sound, and the status will display on the interface. Adjust temperatures between 34°F (1.1°C) and 42°F (5.6°C) as needed, being mindful of ambient temperature effects on performance.

**Lighting Functionality:**  
The interior light can be activated by pressing the "Light" button, with a timer feature that automatically turns it off after four hours. You may toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius display settings by following the indicated button sequence.

**Performance Monitoring:**  
The unit will signal any malfunctions or improper closures with visual and audible alerts. Regular maintenance checks every few months are advised to ensure proper functionality. In cases of prolonged deviations from normal operating conditions, investigate the cause to prevent spoilage.

**Vacation/Sabbath Mode:**  
To accommodate specific religious practices, you can enable Vacation/Sabbath mode, which disables lights and functions without manual intervention. To enter this mode, follow the specified button sequence, which is indicated in the user manual.

**Loading Guidelines:**  
When arranging bottles, ensure that corked items are stored upright on the top racks to maintain freshness, while larger bottles can fit securely on lower shelves. Shelves are designed for easy access and should be loaded from the back to the front for optimal organization.
