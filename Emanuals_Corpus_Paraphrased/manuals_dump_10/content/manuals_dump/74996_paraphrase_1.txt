### DDO60GA Introduction

This document discusses the DDO60GA model in context with British regulations as outlined in the Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It emphasizes the importance of following the user manual to ensure safe operation. The information provided is intended for users who need to operate the device correctly for cooking food and related applications.

### Lighting the Hotplate

To ignite the hotplate, set it to the highest setting and press down immediately. A warning is issued regarding the risk of fire if the hotplate is left unattended. Convert the flame to a lower setting after ignition. Always ensure that the hotplate is turned off after usage. 

### Operating the Hotplate

The hotplate should be adjusted from 'OFF' to 'LOW' and then to 'HIGH' depending on your cooking requirements. For quick meals like chips, maintain a high setting, while for stews or heavier items, a lower heat may suffice. Use caution to prevent overheating, which may warp the hotplate.

### Food Positioning and Cooking

When placing food in the appliance, consider thickness and heat distribution. For optimal cooking, maintain sufficient space around the food items. To preheat effectively, ensure the food is positioned correctly based on the cooking chart, allowing even heat throughout the space.

### Cooking Performance

Ensure proper use of the shelves, allowing adequate airflow for the best cooking results. The manual advises against overcrowding and recommends turning food around midway for consistent cooking.

### Roasting Guidelines

Covering items while roasting can restrict heat flow, affecting cooking quality. Monitor food that may need adjusting to prevent uneven cooking. Follow the provided cooking chart for specific guidelines on time and temperature to achieve the desired results.

### Cooking Chart and Instructions

Refer to the cooking chart for detailed information on cooking times and temperatures for various food items, like roasting meat or baking. Adjust settings according to the specific requirements outlined in the chart.

### Timer Functionality

To utilize the timer, switch it on and set the desired countdown. If powered off during use, the timerâ€™s display will flash. Adjustments can be made by turning the dial forward or backward to set the cooking time accurately. 

This manual should be consulted thoroughly to ensure correct and safe usage of the DDO60GA appliance.

The countdown timer allows you to monitor the cooking process effectively. To use it, switch the timer on when starting your dish. Refer to the cooking chart to determine the required cooking duration for different foods. Once cooking is complete, turn off the timer. Ensure you remember to disconnect the power supply before cleaning.

When preparing food, select items that are appropriate for the cooking method. Adjust the cooking times based on the type of food, particularly for meat, which needs thorough cooking. Follow specific guidelines for thawing and cooking, particularly with soup and beans, to avoid uneven heating.

For cleaning, use only recommended polishes and cleaners, as other products may damage the surface finish. Regularly clean the hotplate and surrounding areas to ensure safe operation. If the hotplate or other components show signs of wear, consult a service professional for maintenance.

Proper positioning of your appliance is vital for effective ventilation and safety. Ensure that it is not placed near flammable materials and always adhere to local appliance regulations.

If there are any power supply issues or if the device seems malfunctioning, check connections and review the product manual for troubleshooting steps. Avoid using incompatible components, as this could lead to unsafe operation or enhance the risk of fire hazards.
