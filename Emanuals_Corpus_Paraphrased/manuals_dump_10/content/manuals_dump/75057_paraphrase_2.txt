## Preface
Dear Customer, thank you for choosing the AEG microwave. Please read the instructions carefully to understand its features and functionalities. This guide provides essential operational information and troubleshooting tips. Follow the instructions diligently to prevent any issues.

## Important Safety Instructions
### WARNING: Carefully Read and Retain for Future Reference
To prevent fire hazards, avoid overheating foods. Ensure the microwave operates correctly and regularly check the outlet for proper functionality. If food overheats, do not open the door immediately; instead, turn off the microwave and allow it to cool.

### Microwave Usage
Only use microwave-safe containers. Regularly clean the cavity, turntable, and cover to avoid grease buildup, which can ignite. Do not microwave sealed containers as they may explode due to steam buildup.

### Precautions
- Individuals with pacemakers should consult their doctor before using the microwave.
- If the microwave exhibits any defects, immediately disconnect it and contact an authorized service technician.

### Child Safety
Educate children about the safe use of the microwave. They should not operate the microwave unattended or play with it.

## Operation Instructions
Follow these steps to set the clock:
1. Press the MICROWAVE POWER LEVEL to select cooking time.
2. Use the TIMER/WEIGHT/PORTION buttons to adjust time settings.

### Microwave Functionality
Microwaves operate by generating electromagnetic waves that heat food through friction. This method allows efficient cooking, thawing, and reheating of various foods.

### Material Suitability
Use microwave-safe materials, including certain plastics and ceramics. Avoid items that can shatter or are not microwave-safe.

### Cooking Tips
When cooking or reheating, it is recommended to cover food to prevent splatter. Always follow food-specific guidelines regarding cover usage and timing to avoid undercooking or overcooking.

## Accessories
Included with your microwave are:
- Turntable
- Turntable fixing screws

Ensure these components are correctly positioned during operation for optimal performance.

## Functionality Overview
To start cooking:
- Choose the desired function (e.g., AUTO COOK, AUTO DEFROST).
- Enter cooking time and power level.
- Press START to initiate cooking.

If the power supply is interrupted, the timer may reset; follow the instructions to restore settings.

For any questions, please contact authorized service personnel for assistance.

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH: Food Testing Guidelines**

To ensure food is properly cooked, use a food thermometer to check its internal temperature. If food easily adheres to surfaces or appears overcooked, it may not be at the right temperature. For thorough cooking, monitor the internal temperature of each food item, as indicated in the chart below, which outlines cooking times for various food and drink items.

**Chart: Cooking Temperatures by Food Item**
- Poultry: [insert temperature]
- Roasted meats: [insert temperature]
- Heating liquids (e.g., coffee): [insert temperature]

It is crucial to cover items with thicker layers, such as meat, to promote even cooking. Blanching vegetables requires immediate heating in boiling water followed by quick cooling in ice water to preserve their color and nutrients. The method allows for subsequent reheating or cooking without overcooking. 

**Microwave Cooking Tips**
When microwaving, the quantity of food affects cooking time. As a rule of thumb:
- Double the amount of food, the cooking time nearly doubles.
- Half the amount will reduce the cooking time by about half.

Prevent overcooking, especially on the outside, by periodically stirring or turning food. Ensure that food retains moisture by covering it while cooking. For items like meats that tend to dry out, covering is essential. 

When reheating prepared meals, they should be covered to avoid uneven heating. Adjust heating times based on food density to ensure thorough defrosting and cooking, particularly in the microwave, where heat is distributed unevenly.

To optimize defrosting, ensure that foods are of uniform thickness. For thicker items, the cooking time may need to be adjusted based on their initial state.

**General Microwave Operation Instructions**
Refer to the specific section for detailed operational instructions, especially for cooking or reheating soups, plated meals, and baked goods. Use the TIMER/WEIGHT/PORTION feature to set cooking times, adjusting power levels as necessary.

For multiple cooking stages, follow the guidelines to input each cooking time and power level accordingly. 

**Quick Start Functionality**
The Quick Start feature allows you to begin cooking immediately by pressing the START/QUICK button for the desired number of seconds. Ensure the microwave is operating before using this function.

**Power Level and Safety Lock**
To check or set the microwave's power level, press the corresponding button to display the currently set level. The safety lock function can be initiated by pressing the STOP button for a few seconds, and can similarly be canceled.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your food is cooked evenly and safely in the microwave.

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH Cooking Functions Overview:**

The AG-32D-UK offers multiple cooking modes: AUTO COOK, COOK FROM FROZEN, and AUTO DEFROST. To utilize any of these functions, simply select the desired option.

- **AUTO DEFROST**: To use the defrosting function, press the AUTO DEFROST button once.

The chosen setting will be displayed. Each mode is accompanied by charts to aid in selecting cooking times based on the food type. It is important to adjust the weight/quantity by rotating the TIMER/WEIGHT/PORTION knob accordingly. 

If you need to manually adjust cooking times, keep in mind that using the QUICK START function can lead to overcooking if not monitored closely. 

### Cooking Procedures
- **AUTO COOK**: Select the option by pressing the START/QUICK button once.
- **COOK FROM FROZEN**: Start this option by pressing the START/QUICK button, then adjust the TIMER/WEIGHT/PORTION as necessary.

### Notes on Recipe Adaptation
When adapting recipes for microwave use, reduce cooking times by one-third to one-half. For high moisture foods, be cautious to avoid overcooking. Adjust portion sizes accordingly for optimal heating.

### Vegetable Cooking Guidelines
When preparing fresh vegetables, follow the recommended guidelines for covering and cooking times specific to each type. 

### Soup Preparation
For soups, combine chopped ingredients, season well, and cover before heating. Allow sufficient time for flavors to meld, ensuring the meat is cooked properly.
