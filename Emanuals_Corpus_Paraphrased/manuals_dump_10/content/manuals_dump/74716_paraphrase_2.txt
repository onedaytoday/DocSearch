### Important Safety Instructions
To ensure the safe operation of this appliance, refer to the enclosed guidelines. Exercise caution when moving the unit as it is heavy. The appliance should only be connected according to the specifications mentioned here. Avoid exposing it to heat sources or leaving the rear unprotected, as specified in the manual. After installation, allow the unit to stabilize before use. Be aware of potential ignition hazards—the appliance should not be accessible to children, and only authorized technicians should conduct maintenance or repairs, especially pertaining to the cooling system. Keep it out of direct sunlight and away from sources of heat (e.g., boilers). Bottled carbonated beverages should not be frozen, as they may explode. Always unplug the unit before cleaning or servicing.

### Description of the Appliance
- Fresh Food Compartment
- Operating Controls: The warning light indicates operational status. To adjust temperature, turn the thermostat clockwise or counterclockwise to set desired cooling levels. 

### Operation
The warning light (red) will illuminate if the appliance reaches an internal temperature indicating high food preservation. If the light comes on, ensure the appliance has been allowed to operate for the minimum specified time to achieve optimal conditions for preservation. 

Once the food is adequately frozen or cooled, switch off the unit, allowing the items to stabilize, which also promotes hygiene. It's important to allow sufficient air circulation between food items to enhance cooling efficiency.

### Normal Operating Sounds
The appliance may produce normal operational sounds, including whirring or clicking from the thermostat. These should not disrupt your surroundings.

### Defrosting 
Frost accumulation requires periodic defrosting. When frost thickness warrants it, switch off the appliance and remove food items. Defrosting may be assisted by placing layers of newspaper around the interior. To resume normal operation, ensure that the interior is thoroughly dried and the appliance is reconnected.

### Maintenance and Cleaning
Prior to cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply. Use soft cloths with non-abrasive cleaners. Never use harsh detergents or highly perfumed products, as these can damage surfaces and leave lingering odors. Ensure the appliance is turned off during the cleaning process.

### Troubleshooting
If issues arise, check the following: Ensure the thermostat is set to the appropriate range (10°C to 32°C). Verify that the appliance door is closing properly, and remove any obstructions. If problems persist, consult service personnel for mechanical or electrical failures.

### Operation and Adjustment
To reposition, carefully tilt the appliance to create a gap, unscrew the necessary components, and reassemble as needed. Avoid overtightening screws to prevent damage. Proper installation ensures optimal functionality and longevity.

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTION WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED.** Ensure that the appliance is properly connected to an earth ground. Disconnect the appliance from the power supply before proceeding with any connections. The colored wires should be connected to the terminals as follows: 

- The earth wire (typically green/yellow) should attach to the terminal marked 'E' or with the earth symbol.
- The neutral wire (usually blue) should connect to the terminal labeled 'N'.
- The live wire (usually brown) should be linked to the terminal marked 'L'.

Make sure to use a fuse that complies with BS1362 AS or BSI standards. Compliance with the relevant E.E.C. Directives for electrical interference is required. Additionally, keep in mind that proper connections can prevent malfunctions. 

**Wires:**
