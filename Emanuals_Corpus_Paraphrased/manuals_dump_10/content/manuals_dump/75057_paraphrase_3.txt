Thank you for choosing the AEG microwave. Please read the instructions carefully to understand the various features and ensure smooth operation. Important safety information is included, as is guidance for troubleshooting any issues. 

**Key Features**
The microwave offers a variety of cooking functions, including options for defrosting and reheating. Detailed charts for cooking times and temperatures, as well as cleaning instructions, are also provided.

**Important Safety Instructions**
- **General Safety:** Always operate the microwave with caution to prevent the risk of fire. Avoid overheating food and ensure that the outlet is easily accessible. If food ignites, do not open the doorâ€”all microwave operations should cease, and the food should be monitored. 
- **Material Use:** Only use microwave-safe materials when heating food. Clean the microwave cavity, turntable, and cover regularly to prevent grease build-up, which could lead to fires.
- **Child Safety:** Supervise children closely when using the microwave, and teach them how to operate it safely. Never allow children to use the microwave as a toy.

**Microwave Use Guidelines**
- **Food Heating:** DO NOT heat sealed containers without puncturing them, as they can explode.

**Setting the Clock**
To set the clock, press the appropriate buttons to select hours and minutes. If there is an interruption in power, you may need to reset the clock.

**Understanding Microwaves**
Microwaves cook food by using electromagnetic waves that create heat through friction. Some materials, like plastic and glass, can heat up during operation, while others may not be microwave-safe. Always monitor cooking times to avoid overheating or burning food.

**UTENSIL SUITABILITY TEST**
To determine if a utensil is microwave safe, follow specific guidelines mentioned in the manual. Ensure dishes do not contain metal, and avoid using any non-microwave-safe materials to prevent overheating and potential hazards.

### Food Testing Guidelines
To determine whether food has been properly cooked, utilize a food thermometer. This device measures the internal temperature of food, ensuring it reaches safe cooking standards. Overcooked food may become dry or stick, while food that is undercooked could be unsafe to eat. For consistent results, check the internal temperature of each item to verify adequate cooking.

### Cooking Chart
Refer to the chart below for optimal cooking temperatures for various food items, including poultry and other dishes. Factors like thickness and structure can impact cooking times. Foods with layered or compact structures may require additional coverage while cooking.

#### Food Preparation Tips
When blanching vegetables, ensure they are submerged in boiling water briefly, then transferred to ice water to halt cooking. This helps retain color and texture. Storing blanched food in airtight containers is crucial for preservation. 

### Microwave Cooking Tips
Microwave cooking varies based on the dish's density. Thicker items may require longer cooking times than thinner portions, which can cook unevenly if left uncovered. Covering food retains moisture and promotes uniform heating. Carefully follow cooking times; reduce cooking duration when using smaller portions.

#### Defrosting
Defrosting requires careful temperature management. Foods should be covered to avoid uneven warming, especially with thicker items. Adjust cooking times based on the thickness of the food.

### Cooking Techniques
For items like meats and vegetables, adhere to proper cooking protocols as recommended in the instructions. Appropriately timing your cooking can result in better flavor and texture. 

### Microwave Operation
To operate the microwave:
1. Set desired cooking or reheating times using the TIMER/WEIGHT/PORTION dial.
2. Adjust power levels as needed. 
3. Initiate cooking by pressing the START/QUICK button. 

### Multiple Sequence Cooking
For meals requiring multiple cooking stages, select the appropriate settings for each stage. Review user instructions to ensure proper operation.

### Quick Start Function
With the Quick Start feature, initiate cooking for a pre-set duration by simply pressing the START/QUICK button. 

### Monitoring Power Levels
You can view and adjust the microwave's power settings by touching the MICROWAVE POWER LEVEL button during operation.

### Safety Lock Feature
To enable the safety lock, press and hold the STOP button for several seconds. To deactivate, repeat the process.
