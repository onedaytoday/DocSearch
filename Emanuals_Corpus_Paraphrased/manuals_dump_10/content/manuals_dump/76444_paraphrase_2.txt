AM Black options allow users to select either traditional powders or liquids based on personal choice. For traditional powders, directly apply to clothing. Alternatively, liquids can be measured and added to the machine. Compact powders and liquids should follow specific application instructions on the packaging.

Fabric conditioners help reduce creases and improve care for fabrics, including various types such as those for machines. Always adhere to the machine's guidelines for optimal use, and utilize conditioning sheets as preferred.

When drying clothes, use the settings provided in the accompanying chart for normal or reduced drying duration, tailored to the fabric type. For synthetics, ensure the washer’s settings match the load type to avoid creases. 

Use the SOAK or STAIN-Action functions for specific treatment without damaging the MAX fabric. To select drying options, activate the corresponding lights to indicate chosen phases. For extra rinsing, utilize the EXTRA RINSE feature, which can be activated alongside PREWASH and QUICK WASH settings. 

To commence operations, press START/PAUSE, which triggers the countdown based on selected settings. If an error light appears, like OVERDOSAGE, ensure to follow measuring guidelines and maintain safety protocols during operation.

For cleaning and maintenance, check hoses for blockages and clean them appropriately. If the washer is exposed to cold temperatures (below 0°C), follow specific instructions to prevent any damage.

In cases of errors, consult troubleshooting guidelines for common issues affecting the operation, such as E10, E20, and E40 codes, which indicate specific problems related to water supply or closure of the doors.

Finally, ensure the settings and connections are correctly adjusted to avoid operational errors, and refer to the washer's chart for guidance on appropriate washing cycles based on fabric types.
