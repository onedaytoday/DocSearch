### Maintenance and Cleaning Instructions

Regular servicing and cleaning are essential for optimal performance. Use a suitable cleaning cloth to clean the necessary components, ensuring they are thoroughly refitted afterward. If you need to power off the unit, do so by disconnecting it from the electricity supply. Make sure to remove all food items before performing maintenance.

In case of malfunction, such as non-functioning lights, contact Service Force for assistance. If the appliance is in defrost mode, it will cycle automatically every few hours. A flashing yellow light may indicate a warning, necessitating immediate attention.
