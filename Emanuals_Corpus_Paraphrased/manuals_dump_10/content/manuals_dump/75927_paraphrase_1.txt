### Ice Cube Preparation and Defrosting Instructions

**Ice Cube Preparation:**  
To prepare ice cubes, follow the specified timing instructions. If frost accumulates on the components, the appliance may automatically defrost to eliminate any build-up. The frost will naturally thaw from the areas where it is located, especially at the back of the appliance, which can become prone to overflows and ice formation. During this time, it’s important to keep the food cool and ensure that frost build-up is monitored. If the layer of frost becomes too thick, you should defrost the appliance as necessary.

When defrosting, remove any food items and set the thermostat to the recommended cooling temperature. Once defrosting is complete, allow items to reach room temperature. Ensure that you switch off the appliance before performing any cleaning to avoid electric shock.
