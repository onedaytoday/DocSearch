I'm sorry, but the text you've provided is overly technical and fragmented, making it difficult to accurately paraphrase while preserving the intended meaning. If you could provide a clearer summary or context of the content, I'd be glad to assist with a more precise paraphrase.

Here is the paraphrased text in a natural, technical manner:

Follow the provided instructions closely, including the recommended performance standards for the specified equipment type. Ensure that operations occur without negatively impacting performance. It is vital to shut down the system as indicated when it is operational. If there is any reason to do so, immediately shut off the equipment by hand.

If using R-12, be aware of the differences with regard to sealed systems when servicing. Heat can accumulate in the crankcase, so it is important to manage this carefully to prevent high temperatures during operation. Always allow the system to cool adequately before servicing. Proper sealing of refrigerants and ensuring effective recovery practices is also essential. The charge from R-12 systems typically has a higher flow rate than R-134a, so adhere strictly to recommended procedures.

When detecting leaks or performing service with R-12, use non-selective leak detectors that allow for the identification of various compounds. Note that the levels of HFC-134a can be hazardous. Exposure to airborne concentrations exceeding the Acceptable Exposure Limit (AEL) determined by agencies like ACGIH can lead to complications including temporary anesthetic effects or respiratory issues. Inhalation of R-134a can also pose serious health risks. Always ensure proper ventilation in work areas to mitigate these risks and use self-contained breathing apparatus when necessary.

HFC-134a has a flashpoint of about 177°C (350°F), suggesting that it's non-combustible under certain conditions yet may become combustible at higher temperatures. Testing with HFC-134a should be performed with care, ensuring that instruments and procedures are properly followed.

For equipment teardown, it’s crucial to observe safety precautions due to the weight of components. Disconnect power to all units when accessing electrical parts to prevent electric shock. Ensure all grounding circuits are intact after servicing, and use caution when handling heavy doors and compressor components.

During the teardown process, remove screws carefully using the appropriate tools. Pay special attention when handling the kickplate and various assemblies to avoid injury. Follow systematic procedures to detach components from each other, and safely manage all activities relating to assembly, including the electrical switch and light shield disconnection.

Overall, adherence to safety and technical guidelines ensures proper servicing and operation of refrigeration systems.

### Teardown Procedure

**Plate Removal**  
Begin by removing the plate, which is secured at the back with four screws. While holding the plate, use another hand to unfasten the cover. Each screw on the plate connects it to the back and cover. Extract these screws using a flathead screwdriver, ensuring the cover can be lifted away from the base after all screws are removed. Carefully disconnect any cables linked to the cover.

**Switch Detachment**  
The switch is mounted to the cover. To release it, disconnect the leads attached to the back of the switch, ensuring the switch can be easily removed through the cover. 

**Housing Assembly Removal**  
The housing contains mounted thermistors on the PCB. To detach the housing or back cover, release the four latches while pulling the leads from the back of the assembly. Once the latches are disengaged, remove the housing completely.

**Assembly Removal**  
The assembly consists of a mounting bracket and screws. To detach, remove the screws attached to the mounting bracket on the back. Disconnect any wiring harness leads. 

**Defrost Thermostat and Heater Removal**  
To access the defrost thermostat, first, remove the cover and disconnect its leads. For the defrost heater, also detach the cover before disconnecting the leads and securing the heater away from the assembly. Carefully remove any insulating materials, such as styrofoam, while ensuring that the screw standoffs mounted on the back of the assembly remain intact.

**Cord Disconnection**  
To disconnect the cord, remove the four screws from the shield using either a screwdriver or wrench. Ensure the ground wires are properly detached to avoid any hazards. After disconnecting, allow any residual energy to dissipate before proceeding with reassembly.

### Troubleshooting Instructions

If the temperature is too warm or too cold, check for any disconnections or malfunctions related to temperature regulation. Replace any blown fuses or reset tripped circuit breakers. Assess the cleanliness or condition of the unit, as dirt or wear could affect functionality.

If unusual sounds are heard from the unit, investigate potential sources of vibration or obstruction. Environmental conditions may also influence performance, leading to increased frost build-up.

For defect diagnosis, it may be necessary to disconnect leads from the thermostat and measure voltage readings. Ensure connections are secure and check for continuity in the wiring harness.

### Thermistor Reference Chart  
For any relevant thermal management procedures or configurations, consult the thermistor chart for specific temperature settings and corresponding readings.
