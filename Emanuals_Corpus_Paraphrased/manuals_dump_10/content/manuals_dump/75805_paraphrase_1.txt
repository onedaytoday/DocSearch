## Important Safety Instructions
To ensure proper operation and safety, users must adhere to the following guidelines. It’s crucial to consult a qualified service technician for any repairs or if unsure about installation procedures. Avoid exposing the appliance to extreme heat or moisture. Before placing it in the desired location, allow sufficient time for the appliance to stabilize after transport. Keep the back of the unit clear and follow distance specifications.

**Child Safety:** Keep children away from the appliance to prevent accidents or potential suffocation hazards. Refrigerants should only be handled by authorized technicians.

## Appliance Description
The refrigerator features adjustable shelves and a thermostat for temperature regulation. Familiarize yourself with its operation:

- **Thermostat Control:** Set the thermostat for optimal cooling based on the type of food stored.

To maintain food freshness, ensure that the air circulation within the appliance is unobstructed. Proper packaging and organization are essential to prevent freezer burn and spoilage.
