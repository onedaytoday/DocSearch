**Preparation of Frozen Cubes for Defrosting**  
To defrost cubes, remove them from their packaging and allow them to sit for a few seconds. Be cautious as frost can form on the surface. During the defrosting process, frost may build up; it's important to manage this frost to maintain efficiency. Ensure that the frost layer is allowed to reach a certain thickness during defrosting, ideally once for each batch of food. **Warning!** Do not use heating devices or other mechanical means to speed up defrosting, as these could pose health risks or compromise plastic components.

To clean, disconnect from the power supply and catch any water runoff. Ensure that items defrost completely before cleaning, and follow the instructions in the "Cleaning" section for regular maintenance. **Caution!** Make sure the appliance is powered off to avoid electric shock while cleaning.

**Cleaning Procedures**  
Switch off the appliance and disconnect it from the electrical supply before cleaning. Use a damp cloth and fresh cleaning agents, avoiding harsh chemicals that may damage the appliance. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines provided in the manual for optimal cleaning and maintenance.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**  
For any operational issues, check the appliance’s power status. If the appliance does not function, inspect the power source for outages or blown fuses. If food is freezing too much, adjust the thermostat warmer temporarily. Conversely, if food is not cooling sufficiently, turn the thermostat colder. Refer to the relevant sections for detailed troubleshooting tips.

**Safety and Regulations**  
This appliance complies with household safety regulations (GSG, VBG, VDE, and EU directives 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG). 

**Technical Overview**  
The cooling process involves transferring heat away from the food. This is achieved using a closed-loop system where heat is exchanged, allowing the appliance to cool down effectively. The compressor is typically located at the rear of the unit, designed to efficiently release the heat to the surrounding environment.
