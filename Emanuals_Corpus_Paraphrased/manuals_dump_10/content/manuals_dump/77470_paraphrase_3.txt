**IMPORTANT:** The Stop/Eject function halts the recording process and allows you to manage recordings directly from the CD player or Compact Disc. To disengage the recording, press the Stop/Eject button while ensuring the front side is facing appropriately. Use compatible tapes, such as CrO (Chrome) or C-60 types; thinner formats may also work. The Record button is used to capture selected recordings directly onto the CD. To temporarily pause the recording, you can also use the Stop/Eject feature, which safely stops the current process. 

The Automatic Level Control (ALC) aids in monitoring recording levels and prevents overload during playback. Adjust the VOLUME for your recordings as required; this can enhance listening quality. The headphone jack (located at the top) allows you to use headphones without disturbing others, helping to manage VOLUME appropriately. Note that the built-in speakers will disconnect when headphones are plugged in.

**CARE AND MAINTENANCE:** Ensure that recordings are properly saved. If there are any issues, you may need to check the screws or remove the cover to troubleshoot. The recording function can be disrupted if the protective tape is improperly managed; use caution when handling the cover to prevent accidental recordings. 

To maintain optimal performance, avoid exposing the device to direct sunlight and ensure the heads are cleaned regularly. Use a soft cloth or head cleaner to remove residues that could impact performance. For cleaning CDs, use lint-free cloths and avoid harsh chemicals.

**TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:** Should you encounter issues, consult the following for potential solutions. For poor reception on AM or FM, recalibrate the antenna or adjust the BAND switch until the desired signal is clear. Ensure the function switch is correctly set to RADIO or CD, depending on the mode of playback you require. If problems persist with the CD (such as errors or scratches), please clean the disc or contact customer support.
