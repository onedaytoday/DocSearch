**Cookware Guidelines for Optimal Performance**

*Cookware Selection:* Use straight and tight-fitting utensils that distribute heat evenly, and match the cookware size to the amount of food being prepared. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and usage.

*Using the Griddle:* Ensure that food is evenly cooked by utilizing various types of cookware, avoiding curved-bottom tools. Adjust the positioning carefully, and use heat-resistant potholders to prevent burns.

*Using the Wok Stand:* Use a round-bottom wok with a proper stand (recommended models: E30DF74EPS, E36DF76EPS, E48DF76EPS) for optimal performance. Ensure it is correctly positioned to avoid hazards.

*Using the Simmer Plate:* Position the simmer plate at its lowest setting for slow cooking. Always ensure heat-resistant surfaces are used, and allow it to cool appropriately after use.

*Surface Control Settings:* Adjust settings based on the type and amount of food being cooked. Monitor indicator lights for active settings, and maintain safety by keeping flammable items away from heat sources.

*Before Cooking:* Ensure the cooking area is clean and that test protectors are installed properly. 

*Operating Control Valves:* To ignite, rotate counterclockwise to the desired setting (HI, LITE). If igniting fails, turn off and wait before attempting again. Ensure proper airflow and clear any clogs.

*Setting Flame Height:* Adjust flame height for cooking efficiency while reducing the risk of scorching. Use smooth, tight-fitting cookware for optimal heat retention.

*Oven Rack Setup:* Install oven racks when the oven is cool, positioning them correctly to enhance heat circulation for efficient cooking and baking. 

*Oven Features for E48DF76EPS:* This model features a companion oven. Ensure proper preheating and rack placement to accommodate various cooking needs.

### Instructions for Convection Baking

When using convection baking, it's generally advisable to reduce the temperature by 25°F and adjust the cooking time as recommended for the specific item. The convection heating element located in the chamber circulates hot air around the food, promoting even cooking. This feature allows cooking temperatures to range from 170°F to 500°F. When cooking with convection, account for the type and quantity of food being prepared.

**To Preheat to 350°F:**
1. Set the mode to Convection.
2. Adjust the temperature to 350°F.
3. Observe the LED light, which will flash during preheating.
4. The light will stop flashing and emit a sound once the oven reaches 350°F.
5. If changing from 350°F to 425°F, repeat the process, listening for the sound indicating that 425°F has been reached.

### Instructions for Convection Roasting

For ideal convection roasting, ensure that meat is properly seared to lock in juices. The convection method allows heat to circulate around the meat, promoting even cooking. When roasting poultry, ensure that the breast fits snugly to optimize steaming. Basting may be recommended to enhance flavor.

**Cooking Tips:**
- Use a meat thermometer to check the thickest part of the meat (for poultry, this means the thigh).
- Insert the thermometer away from the bone for an accurate reading.
- If the meat's internal temperature is below the recommended level, continue cooking.

### Roasting Instructions Precautions

Food should not be covered during roasting unless specified. For best results, lightly crush any ingredients or follow specific cookbook guidelines. 

**Note:** There is no automatic preheat feature in this mode. 

### Broiling Instructions

Broiling cooks meat using high heat from above with the door closed. Preheat the broiler by setting it to the Broil mode, allowing the heating elements to become red-hot. Season your food as desired before cooking and monitor closely to avoid burning. 

**Safety Precautions:**
- Do not cover broiling items as this may lead to grease catching fire.
- Handle grease fires with care; use appropriate extinguishers or throw suffocating materials (e.g., baking soda) to quell flames.

### Self-Cleaning Instructions

Allow the oven to cool before cleaning. Use caution and wear gloves when performing manual maintenance. 

**Important Guidelines:**
- Do not allow children near the oven during the self-cleaning cycle.
- Avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage the surface.
- Ensure the oven cavity is empty before starting the self-cleaning process. 

**Starting Self-Cleaning Cycle:**
When ready, initiate the self-cleaning by selecting the Clean mode. The cycle usually lasts about three hours. For safety, never force the oven door open while in this mode.

### Cleaning Tips for Range Cooktop

Cleaning should generally be performed by the owner/operator. Prioritize safety by ensuring the cooktop is off and cool before starting the cleaning process. 

**General Cleaning Advice:**
- Follow manufacturer instructions for maintaining appearance and functionality.
- Use appropriate cleaning materials to avoid damage.
- Stubborn stains may require full-strength cleaning agents or consulting customer service.

Following these guidelines will ensure your oven is maintained properly for optimal performance and longevity.

### Cleaning Stainless Steel Surfaces
Use a cleaning solution along with a lint-free cloth to maintain stainless steel surfaces. **Important**: If you utilize cleaners, ensure they are compatible and free from chlorine compounds. Clean thoroughly with a lint-free cloth.

### Cleaning Porcelain Grates
Clean the porcelain grates with a suitable cleaning agent and a cloth. For stubborn stains, avoid the dishwasher as it may damage the grates.

### Cleaning Knobs and Knob Bezels
Use appropriate cleaners for knobs and bezels to ensure durability and function. Clean the knobs and their bases carefully, avoiding excess moisture that could damage components. 

### Cleaning Burner Bases
Ensure the burners are turned off before cleaning. Use a soft cloth for light cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals that may damage the surface. 

### Cleaning Burner Rings
Ensure burner rings are seated properly for optimal performance. Clean thoroughly, particularly focusing on the notches to avoid malfunction.

### Cleaning Burner Igniters
Igniters can accumulate food debris, making them less effective. Clean thoroughly around the igniter’s head and base, avoiding water use during cleaning.

### General Cleaning 
Always clean surfaces while they are turned off and cool. Attend to spills and heavy soiling promptly to minimize the need for extensive cleaning later. Use a clean cloth and approved cleaners, avoiding abrasives.

### Oven Light Assembly
The oven light assembly consists of a cover that protects the bulb from damage. Always turn off the power before handling the light. 

### Common Problems and Solutions
If the oven does not heat, check the electrical connections and ensure the settings are correct.
