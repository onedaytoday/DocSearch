By following these instructions, users can maintain the efficiency and longevity of their washer-dryer while ensuring safe usage.

The drying process begins when the cycle is activated, and the updated status of the dryer is displayed. The items, such as towels and shirts, undergo a redistribution phase, which may slightly alter their positioning within the drum. Indicators may flash during this redistribution, and if necessary, the drying phase can be interrupted by turning the dryer off.

To efficiently sort items for drying, separate them as follows: whites, colors, and synthetics. White items should be washed separately to maintain their brightness, while new colored items should be washed prior to drying. Tough stains may require special treatment, such as soaking overnight with a suitable cleaner or applying bleach cautiously (only for whites). 

Select the appropriate temperature for each type of fabric—cottons, synthetics, or delicates—while considering the manufacturer's instructions and recommended settings. If a prewash option is selected, ensure to follow the guidelines for quantities and water types.

Bear in mind that certain garments, especially those made from light-colored fabrics or delicate materials, should be handled with care during the drying cycle to avoid attracting lint or sustaining damage. Additionally, ensure that all parts of the dryer, particularly the hose and compartment filters, are cleaned regularly to maintain optimal performance.  

For emergency emptying procedures, turn off the dryer, detach the hose, and follow specific steps to ensure safe operation. Regular maintenance checks are crucial to prevent blockages or malfunctions. If issues arise, consult the user manual for troubleshooting guidance or contact customer service as needed.

Certainly! Here’s a paraphrased version of the text while retaining the original meaning:

---

Ensure that the unit is properly closed. The E40 code indicates a secure connection. Please make sure everything is correctly installed and pressed into place. If the system needs immediate cleaning, activate the Child Lock feature. To deactivate it, close the unit and check hose connections for the E10 error. Clean the hose and ensure it is securely attached. If your system shows an E20 error, the hose may be clogged. In that case, clear the selected options or address any issues with the appropriate phases. If redistribution of items is necessary, do so and monitor for any obstructions. If it’s difficult to resolve, assess whether another approach is needed.

For technical guidance regarding capacity, dimensions, or service information, please refer to the rating plate. Ensure all connections, particularly at the back of the unit, are firm. Follow the installation instructions closely to avoid blockages. If required, adjust any sections to ensure proper operation. 

Always pay attention to the supply connections and ensure they are correctly threaded to prevent leakage. Lengthen the hose if necessary for effective water flow, and use specialized hose types if the existing one is insufficient. Proper maintenance can usually be achieved without pre-washing.

For further details on recycling services, please consult your local regulations, ensuring that any treated household items are disposed of correctly to safeguard health and the environment.
