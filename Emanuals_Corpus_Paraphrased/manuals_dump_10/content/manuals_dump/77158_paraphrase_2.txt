### Testing Guidelines for the MSR 15D1 TOUCHCOMPUTER

To ensure the functionality of the MSR (Magnetic Stripe Reader) USB interface (HID) on the 15D1 TOUCHCOMPUTER, perform the following steps:

1. **USB MSR Testing**:
   - Double-click the HID device in your system.
   - If the device ID is displayed, it indicates proper operation. You can also connect to the touchcomputer to test its interaction with the software, accessible via [www.elotouch.com](http://www.elotouch.com). 

2. **Character Display Testing**:
   - Ensure that all supported international characters are displayed correctly on the VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) with the specified brightness settings. The character dimensions are approximately 5.5mm (W) x 10.5mm (H).
   - The system requires a typical power supply of 5.0VDC at 0.25A.

3. **FPR Specifications**:
   - To confirm the FPR (Fingerprint Reader) functionality, double-click to check its settings.
   - Support for both 1-D and 2-D scanning is available through optional interfaces. Ensure both interfaces are compatible with the USB setup.

4. **Operating System and Recovery**:
   - For XP and POSReady users, follow the on-screen prompts to recover the device to factory settings using the recovery DVD.
   - Recovery steps include accessing the recovery options during startup (pressing F11 for built-in recovery or F8 for advanced options).
