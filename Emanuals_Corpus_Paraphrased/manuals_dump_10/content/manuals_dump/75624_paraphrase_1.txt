The appliance has a built-in light that can be activated manually or will turn on automatically under certain conditions. To adjust sound notifications, you can mute them based on your preference. The system also allows you to reset to factory settings via a three-second button press.

**Important:** Properly maintain the water supply to avoid malfunctions and check the supply periodically. The fridge operates best if the water connection is active.

To fill the fresh food section, adjust the shelves as needed for better organization, facilitating easy access to items. These shelves can accommodate various items and should be cleaned regularly.

This refrigerator is equipped with features to promote food preservation. It is advisable to keep food items tightly wrapped to avoid off-flavors and freezer burn. 

**Maintenance and Care:** The Perfect™ should be cleaned with mild cloths and cleaners, avoiding any harsh chemicals. Ensure regular checks on the water filter and other components for optimal performance.

The appliance will produce normal operational sounds; these should not indicate a malfunction. Sounds may vary during normal operation or when transitioning to defrost.

Finally, be aware of the advanced certifications from NSF International related to health standards which assure effective performance in water quality reduction and safe food storage practices.

Here’s a paraphrased version of the provided text with a technical tone while retaining the original meaning:

To operate the system, ensure you hear clicking sounds. Activate the power by pressing the front release button while holding the housing. Next, like before with the supply, press and hold for three seconds. The water and relevant components are located in the TM section and should be monitored every month (indicated by a light on the sensor after multi-month intervals). It's important to pack and unpack food correctly to prevent build-up in the housing. 

To secure the housing, align it properly and press the top to close it firmly, maintaining pressure for three seconds. Disconnect the power supply and allow it to rest for several seconds before reconnecting. This is essential for maintenance; you can find additional guidance on www.electroluxappliances.com or from the point of purchase.

When addressing maintenance, avoid using abrasive cleaners such as scouring agents, bleach-based products, or other harsh cleaning materials that might damage surfaces. In case of cooling issues or if there is a need to power off the unit, ensure proper connection guidelines are followed to prevent potential hazards.

For cleaning interiors and other components, a soft cloth should be used, especially on parts that might scratch easily. Be mindful to turn off cooling for short vacations or if items risk spoilage. 

When it comes to the LED lights, ensure to maintain them properly by checking the light cover and ensuring the LED is directed towards the fresh food compartment. Use protective gear if necessary when performing maintenance.

For water connection issues, make sure the supply is adequately seated and that household connections are not restricted. If ice is produced slowly or not at all, verify household systems and ensure the ice compartment is not overloaded. Adjust settings for optimal performance and cleanliness in the unit to avoid unnecessary blockages and operational issues.

If the unit appears too cold or if food is freezing, adjust settings or allow time for the temperature to normalize. Keep food organized to promote even cooling. Regular checks and balances will ensure the unit operates effectively without build-up.

Lastly, monitor for any moisture or frost accumulation, particularly if connected to household systems that may be impacted by weather conditions. Regular maintenance and adherence to guidelines will help maintain the unit's performance and longevity.
