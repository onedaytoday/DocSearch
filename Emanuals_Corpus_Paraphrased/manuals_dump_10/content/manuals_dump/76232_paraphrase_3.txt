Ensure that all instructions are adhered to for optimal appliance performance and safety. For further clarification, consult the provided sections according to your needs.

Sure, here's a paraphrased version of the text:

To initiate or pause the machine, press the START/PAUSE button. If the END light flashes and an acoustic signal sounds, ensure the door is properly closed. Close the door firmly, then press START/PAUSE again for the acoustic signal to stop. The selected program will be displayed on the screen. If you need to switch off the machine, turn the knob to the OFF position. You can temporarily pause the DRAIN or SPIN options by pressing START/PAUSE again. If the QUICK option is selected, pressing START/PAUSE will begin that cycle.

For rinsing with the RINSE HOLD option, press START/PAUSE alongside HOLD. The END light will indicate the cycle's completion. If RINSE HOLD is chosen, the corresponding lights will activate. You can turn the machine to OFF, then select DRAIN or SPIN to proceed.

Regular maintenance is required for optimal performance. If cleaning is needed, use a damp cloth, avoiding scouring agents. Clean the exterior and the interior components as specified in the instructions. If operation involves high temperatures below C, power off the machine to protect its components and prevent frost damage.

In case of operational issues, refer to troubleshooting guidelines. If the START/PAUSE light goes out or reappears during operation, consider contacting service support.

For installation, follow the safety guidelines, ensuring proper grounding and electrical connections. If connected directly to the power supply, use a suitable breaker and ensure the grounding is intact. Additionally, ensure there's no risk of backflow in the water supply by implementing protective measures.

When connecting the water supply, use appropriate fittings and checks to prevent leaks. It is essential to follow the installation guidelines for securing hoses and ensuring proper height for operation.
