### Oven Cleaning Instructions

Before cleaning your oven, ensure that it is unplugged and completely cooled down. For continuous-clean ovens, avoid using steel wool, abrasive cleaning pads, or metal utensils to scrub surfaces, as this may severely damage the continuous-clean coating. Instead, use a soft cloth for cleaning both the interior and exterior. Do not apply any abrasive cleaners on the roasting rack either, as this can also harm its coating. Ensure all components and surfaces are thoroughly dried before reconnecting the appliance and using it again.
