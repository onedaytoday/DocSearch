**Cooking Guidelines**

When preparing meals, ensure the meat is cooked thoroughly to make it tender and cost-effective. Proper heating is essential. Use a meat thermometer to verify that the internal temperature reaches at least 70°C. Before cooking, thaw any frozen meat completely and then reduce the heat as needed.

For soups, bring ingredients to a boil on the hotplate before reducing the temperature. Cover pots tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to retain heat, and allow to cook. Thickening agents like cornflour can help achieve the desired consistency without curdling.

Reheat cooked food only once, and ensure it remains at safe temperatures to avoid foodborne illness.

**Cleaning Instructions**

Cleaning is crucial to maintain appliance performance and safety. Use appropriate cleaning materials to avoid damage to surfaces. If using a dishwasher, follow the manufacturer's instructions. A soft cloth is recommended for cleaning surfaces, avoiding harsh chemicals that could dull finishes.

For the hotplate, ensure it is clean and free of food residue. Regular maintenance helps prevent burns and splashes during cooking. If necessary, remove any burnt-on food using suitable cleaning pads.

**Preventive Maintenance**

Routine checks of appliance components, including screws and electrical connections, ensure safe operation. If you find any damage or malfunctions, contact a service specialist for assistance.
