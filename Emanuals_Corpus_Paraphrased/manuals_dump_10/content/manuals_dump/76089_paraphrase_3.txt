This document outlines the technical details for the ELECTROLUX Z8240 vacuum cleaner, including information on specifications and user instructions. 

If any issues arise, such as the light turning off or the motor stalling, ensure to switch off the vacuum immediately. During operation, if you need to pause cleaning, you can attach the tube to the cleaner conveniently. When storing, the vacuum cleaner can be placed with the tube secured to it to save space.

To empty the TwinClean's dust container, press the designated release button and detach it from the cleaner. Make sure to dispose of the waste properly, ensuring the container clicks securely back into place after emptying. Regular maintenance is critical for optimal suction; when itâ€™s time to clean the filter, the filter light will blink. Switch off the unit when this occurs, then release the cover and carefully clean the filter. 

Turn the filter frame while following the indicated direction and replace it when necessary. If the light continues to flash too frequently, it indicates that the filter needs to be washed.

For cleaning, both the standard filter and the HEPA filter should be addressed; the standard filter needs cleaning every 5-7 years, while the HEPA filter (which is thicker with increased fiber material) should be cleaned every few years. Dust containers can be removed by pressing the release mechanism located on the rear and ensuring all catches are disengaged.

To clean the filters, gently tap the frame to remove water and repeat the process four times. Additionally, check and clear any obstructions in the hose, ensuring the vacuum cooler down before addressing blockages. Always replace dirty filters to maintain optimal performance. 

For further instructions on filter maintenance, rinse them in lukewarm water and allow them to air dry before reusing. Ensure that the vacuum cleaner is completely reassembled before operation.
