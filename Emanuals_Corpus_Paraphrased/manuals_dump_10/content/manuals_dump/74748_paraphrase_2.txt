**Service Note for Malfunctioning Equipment**

If the equipment is flashing, it indicates an issue that requires attention. Ensure the unit is fully closed and clean. If food products have been in the appliance for several hours, distribute them appropriately to prevent spoilage. Verify that the warmer is switched on; it should display the highest temperature indicated. 

Note that continuous operation is necessary for proper function. If there is a connection issue, consult the section on "Switching On and Off." Ensure the supply line is properly connected. If you experience any flashing lights or sounds, it could signal that the temperature is too high. 

If you hear a ticking sound, it may come from the thermostat cycling. If the sound is abnormal, check the positioning of the spacers and follow the provided assembly instructions. Should the condition of the food be in doubt, it is recommended to discard it to ensure safety.

**Installation and Connection Guidelines**

It is critical to unpack and set up your appliance in a safe, recycling-friendly manner to avoid suffocation hazards. Regular cleaning is important—use a damp cloth to maintain the unit's condition. 

When connecting the supply, ensure the coupling is sufficiently tightened to prevent leaks. If the hose is damaged or cracked, replace it with the supplied replacement to ensure continued performance. 

Maintain proper positioning to prevent short-circuits, overheating, and potential fire hazards. Do not place the appliance in direct sunlight or near heat sources, as this can reduce efficiency. 

Ensure grounding is established prior to operation. Refer to the ratings displayed for temperature limits and compatibility.
