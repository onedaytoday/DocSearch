### Installation Instructions

**Removal of Old Filter**  
Carefully remove the old filter and dispose of it.  

**Cleaning the Blower Compartment**  
Before proceeding, ensure that the blower and blower housing are cleaned. The Highboy typically requires that the unit is positioned upright with the inlet facing the appropriate direction. For optimal service access, make sure to release the latch and detach components as needed.

**Duct Configuration**  
If modifications are necessary, ensure that they align with the existing system. A duct must not exceed a four-inch height increase for effective airflow.

### Technical Repair Guide

**Repair Services**  
All servicing should be performed by authorized personnel familiar with high-voltage systems. This ensures safety and the integrity of the unit.  

**Troubleshooting Advice**  
Address any malfunctions promptly to ensure optimal airflow and efficiency. The guide includes troubleshooting steps for common issues related to the high-voltage components and airflow functions. 

For any complex repairs or system adjustments, refer to factory specifications or professional service.

**POWER SUPPLY CHECKOUT PROCEDURE**

1. Ensure the switch is set to OFF and disconnect the flow switch cover. 
2. Connect the flow switch to the three-pin connector (white to white-brown wire) as illustrated.
3. Secure the lead wires from the switch, ensuring insulation is maintained and connected to the chassis.
4. Switch the power ON, observe if the light indicator activates. 
5. Measure the DC voltage; it should be present. If the light does not turn on and the voltage is low, check for any damaged insulators that may need replacement.
6. For the Air Flow Monitor Test, apply AC voltage. Activate the switch and use a thermistor to verify flow. After blowing into the thermistor, check whether the AC voltage appears. If there is no voltage, revisit previous connections as outlined.
