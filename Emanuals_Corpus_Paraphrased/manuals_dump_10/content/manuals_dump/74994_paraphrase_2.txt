- **Cooling Feature:** Engages automatically when the oven is switched off.
- **Indicator Lights:** Show the operational status of the oven.

**GRILL AND OVEN ACCESSORIES**
Ensure you use compatible accessories. If any are missing, contact authorized service.

### FIRST USE
Before the initial operation, reset the oven and perform a trial run at maximum temperature without any food inside to clear any manufacturing residues.

### TIMER CONTROL
- The timer can be set to automate cooking functions.
- Instructions include setting the time and managing cooking durations.

### DUAL GRILL CAUTION
Be aware that accessible parts may become hot during grilling. Keep children away from the area.

### TELESCOPIC RUNNERS
If equipped, ensure correct installation and operation of telescopic runners for ease of use. 

For further service inquiries or to purchase additional parts, contact authorized service providers.

### Grill Pan and Handle

Ensure the grill pan and handle are correctly positioned with the handle aligned above the center of the cooking area. The food should sit centrally on the grill to maximize heat distribution. Adjust the food's position based on its thickness and cooking requirements, ensuring adequate space between items to facilitate even cooking and prevent splattering. For meats, preheat the grill thoroughly for optimal browning. Cook food as needed, monitoring the grilling progress based on the AEG Grilling Chart.

### Second Oven

The second oven is designed for baking purposes, preheating to the selected temperature before cooking dishes like cakes or pastries. When using this oven, switch off when required. Ensure food is placed directly on the shelf for uniform cooking. Use the cranked shelf, inserting it straight at the back. 

### Main Fan Oven

The main fan oven facilitates even cooking by circulating heat. Preheat the oven before cooking, as this enhances the cooking process. Follow recommended temperature guidelines, adjusting slightly as needed for batch baking. Ensure shelves are properly positioned for optimal heat flow during cooking. 

### Conventional Oven

This oven mode allows for cooking without circulating air, suitable for specific dishes like gratins. Keep food centered on the shelf for even heating. Monitor internal temperatures, using appropriate cookware to ensure effective cooking.

### Roasting Chart

Utilize the roasting chart to determine cooking times and internal temperatures for various meats at recommended settings, ensuring proper doneness.

### Pizza Function

This function is ideal for achieving a crisp crust, allowing for optimal browning. Position food directly on the shelf to enhance heating.

### Speedcook

The Speedcook function allows for fast cooking without preheating, though adjustments may be necessary based on food specifics. 

### Thermal Grilling

This mode combines grilling and regular cooking methods to prepare items evenly while retaining moisture. Ensure the oven door remains closed to maintain heat efficiency.

### Hints and Tips for Food Preparation

**Cooking Guidelines**: Foods should be loosely placed in the oven, allowing heat to circulate effectively around them. For optimal results, food items like meats should be positioned on the higher shelves to achieve thorough cooking. It's essential to monitor cooking temperatures between 140-220°C, adjusting as necessary. 

**Thermal Grilling**: Refer to the thermal grilling chart for specific cooking times and temperatures based on food type and thickness. Ensure food is evenly cooked by following these guidelines.

**Defrosting**: The defrost function should be utilized for thawing food without introducing heat. This is particularly effective for items like cakes with frosting. Avoid leaving defrosted food at room temperature for extended periods to minimize bacterial growth.

**Food Safety Tips**:
- Ensure that food is freshly purchased and properly covered or insulated during transport.
- Always follow cooking instructions for both raw and reheated foods.
- Utilize a meat thermometer to verify that meat has reached safe internal temperatures, with recommended figures of 60°C, 70°C, and 80°C, depending on the type of meat.

### Care and Cleaning Instructions

**Before Cleaning**: Ensure the oven’s cooling fan has fully cooled down before switching off the electricity supply.

**Cleaning Products**: Use appropriate cleaners that won't damage the finishes. Avoid bleach-based products and harsh cleaners on the oven exterior.

**External Cleaning**: Use a soft cloth for the exterior surfaces and appropriate cleaners, such as non-abrasive polishes, on the glass and metal components.

**Interior Cleaning**: Clean the oven's interior using designated formulas compatible with its coating. Follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions.

**Glass Panels**: For inner glass doors, follow outlined procedures for removal and replacement to avoid damage. Be cautious of any chips or scratches that may cause hazards.

**Oven Light Replacement**: Ensure the oven is off and cooled before replacing the bulb. Access the bulb as per the manual instructions.
