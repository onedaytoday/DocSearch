### Cooking Guidelines and Tips

**Positioning Food:**
When using the oven, ensure that food is placed centrally on the shelf to allow for even cooking. The tray or dish should not touch the walls to facilitate proper air circulation and minimize cleaning efforts.

**Top Oven Usage:**
The top oven provides specific cooking capabilities. It is advised to preheat the oven to the desired temperature before placing your food inside. Always turn off the oven immediately after use, as this ensures safety and helps in maintaining the appliance.

**Note on Shelf Placement:**
Shelves should be installed straight and secured to avoid any hazards. Ensure that the front is clear for both safety and compliance with cleaning norms.

**Heat Zones in the Main Oven:**
The main oven has varying heat zones, with the upper shelf being slightly hotter and the lower shelf cooler. Adjust cooking times and shelf positions based on the type of food being prepared, as specific items might cook better in certain areas.

### Cooking Charts

**Cooking Times and Temperatures:**
Refer to the cooking chart for specific times and temperatures for different food items. Adjust your cooking duration based on the item’s size and desired doneness.

**Slow Cooking:**
Slow cooking is a cost-effective method, ideal for tougher cuts of meat. Preheat the slow cooker and ensure that meats reach an internal temperature of at least 88°C for safe consumption.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

**General Cleaning:**
Always disconnect the power supply before cleaning. Use recommended cleaning products suitable for the appliance finishes, and avoid harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces.

**Maintaining the Hob:**
Keep the hotplate clean, ensuring that burners are free from food residue. Replace the crown carefully, verifying its proper placement to ensure effective ignition.

### Cleaning Specific Areas

**Oven Compartment Maintenance:**
The interior of the oven and grill should be maintained regularly. Use appropriate cleaners that align with the Stayclean coating properties to avoid damage.
