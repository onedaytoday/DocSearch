Important safety notes include avoiding overheating and fire hazards. Ensure the power cord is in good condition and not obstructed in any way, as this can lead to shorts or fires. It’s crucial not to operate the appliance without following the manufacturer's instructions to prevent electrical shocks or damages.

When unpacking, the appliance should remain switched off until properly positioned and installed according to the guidelines provided—particularly considering space and airflow around the unit. Make sure the appliance is level, and recheck screws and fittings for stability.

In terms of overall setup, ensure that the appliance is kept away from heat sources and that it operates in accordance with the environmental temperature classifications indicated. 

When adjusting the shelf heights, ensure this is done correctly for optimal food storage and maintenance. Be cautious about keeping foods organized to prevent blocking airflow, contributing to frost buildup and temperature inconsistencies.

For the COOLMATIC function, the control panel allows you to set your desired temperature, indicated by a flashing display. It’s designed to maintain the ideal conditions for food preservation. 

If you have any questions or need further assistance, refer to the sections listed in the manual related to these functions for additional guidance.

The rear section of the appliance indicates that as it closes, the contents are sealed more effectively. Below, various types of food including confectionery, ready-made dishes, yogurt, bottles, and seafood can be stored in the chiller compartment. This area is designated for fresh food items, such as meat and seafood, which are maintained at optimal temperatures.

The appliance includes a chart that provides operational instructions regarding the cooling of food. It highlights the significance of maintaining correct temperatures to ensure food safety and freshness.

To activate the FROSTMATIC function, press button H, which is highlighted in yellow. The function can be adjusted using buttons I and K. These control settings will switch back from the desired temperature (indicated by flashing lights) to the actual current temperature. The system will revert to the ACTUAL setting if neither button is used within a specified timeframe.

To initiate cooling, press button A; a light will flash indicating that the desired temperature has been reached, alongside an audible alert. The FROSTMATIC function is instrumental in protecting fresh food by quickly bringing its temperature down. This function can be manually toggled off after an appropriate duration, generally indicated by a yellow control light.

When the appliance is switched off using button A, it will cease operation properly. It's recommended to clean the unit regularly and avoid using harsh chemicals that may damage the surface or components.

Proper stacking of food within the appliance is crucial to ensure efficient air circulation and to prevent frost build-up. Foods should be cooled appropriately before storing, limiting interactions with warmer food items.

Finally, if any malfunction occurs, a troubleshooting chart is provided to help identify issues based on sounds or indicators. If service is needed, disconnect the appliance from the power supply to ensure safety during maintenance. 

Always make sure that food is stored in airtight containers to maintain freshness for as long as possible.
