### Strobe Installation for ELK-1RT or ELK-150RT Stainless Steel Box

**A)** If your ELK stainless steel box is already installed, remove the front cover (there's no need to take out the speaker). For new siren box installations, attach the stainless steel backplate and speaker/siren as per the included instructions.

**B)** Secure the strobe unit to the lower flange of the backplate by sliding the clear plastic wiring protector into the left (outer) slot. The end with the loose wires should be directed upwards and towards you. Ensure that the wire slide is fully positioned against the wall.

**C)** Connect the red (12V+) and black wires from the strobe to either the non-pulsed alarm output or the violation output. While most pulsed outputs can also operate the strobe, the flash rate may be slightly irregular.

**Specifications:**
- Operating Voltage: D.C.

- Flash Rate: Approx. flashes per second
- Not suitable for continuous applications.
