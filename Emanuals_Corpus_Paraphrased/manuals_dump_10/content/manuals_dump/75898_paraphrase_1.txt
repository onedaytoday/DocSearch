### Cooling Function Overview

To activate the cooling function, select the relevant options displayed on the interface. If there is no activity for a set period, the system will enter standby mode, indicated by a brief inactivity duration. The system may sound an alert and display "HI" for high temperature conditions. When the cooling function is deactivated, it will acknowledge this status and halt operation.

The Wave-Touch™ and IQ-Touch™ interfaces allow for easy activation and deactivation, ensuring seamless operation within community guidelines. Note that the Wave-Touch™ feature requires a manual process to turn it on and off by holding both buttons for a few seconds. Sound notifications can also be muted according to user preference. However, warning signals remain active for safety reasons.

If the cooling system is inactive for three seconds, it will signal to shut down for cleaning purposes, turning off any running functions. The temperature display will then read “High.” In the event of any malfunctions or concerns regarding water supply, please ensure that the system is functioning correctly to prevent operational issues.

### Ice and Water Dispensing

To manage the ice and water dispensing functions, press and hold the corresponding button for three seconds to switch between "ON" and "OFF." The system will notify you when the ice feature is disabled. If the water or ice supply becomes obstructed, check for blockages and clean accordingly. 

When using chemical cleaners, avoid applying them directly to any components. Allow time for proper cooling and purging, and periodically check supply lines to maintain performance.

### Storage and Organization

The shelves are designed for easy access, allowing for optimal placement of food items. The layout accommodates various types of containers, including larger bottles. The system offers adjustable modules to customize food storage efficiently.

To maintain freshness, the compartments should be monitored for humidity levels and adjusted as necessary. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Regular cleaning of the unit is essential; avoid using harsh chemicals. Instead, use cloths designed for cleaning the specific surfaces. To reinstate operations after cleaning, ensure that all shutdown processes are complete.

For specifics on operating and managing features like the PerfectTemp™, refer to the provided guidelines. Ensure that items are stored correctly to prevent improper cooling or freezing. Always handle components with care to avoid damage and maintain optimal performance. 

### Final Notes

It is critical to adhere to all guidelines regarding the use and maintenance of the cooling systems to ensure longevity and efficiency. Follow instructions precisely to avoid operational issues or product damage.

Certainly, here’s a more concise and technical paraphrase of the text:

Fresh food should be stored properly in a refrigerator to avoid overcrowding, which can hinder air circulation and cooling. It's essential to keep meat and poultry wrapped securely to prevent contamination, and to organize items so that air flows freely. Food that is compressed or improperly stored can spoil or degrade faster.

Sounds originating from high-efficiency components, like the defrost heater and ice maker, are normal during operation, indicating that the appliance is functioning correctly. Any unusual hissing, clicking, or high-pitched noises should be noted, as they can inform you about the system’s performance.

For optimal use of water filters and food storage, ensure proper loading techniques. Pay attention to how long filters remain effective and how to handle water supply connections. It’s crucial to clean the appliance regularly with appropriate cleaners, avoiding abrasive or bleach-containing products, to maintain its appearance and performance.

When operating the appliance during vacations, make sure to turn off cooling if storing food for an extended period, and check that the light systems and seals are functioning properly.

In summary, adhere to recommended cleaning and maintenance practices, store items efficiently, and monitor appliance sounds to ensure longevity and optimal performance.

**(continued)** The refrigerator is either too cold or too warm. For satisfactory operation, refer to the solution above. Food, particularly meat, is too warm, especially in common rooms or during hot weather. The refrigerator has recently been disconnected, affecting the automatic ice maker. The temperature is too low, as indicated by controls in the fresh food section. Ensure that the seals are clean, undamaged, and properly fitted. 

This model features a high-efficiency variable-speed compressor. The electronic control system has detected an incorrect temperature. If the refrigerator is exposed to warm air, this may cause an increase in temperature. Avoid blocking the door with food or containers. It's advisable to allow 24 hours for the system to stabilize after adjustments. 

In cases where water and/or excessive moisture or frost accumulates on surfaces, it may indicate that the temperature control is set too high, or the water supply is improperly connected. The connection tubes could affect the taste and odor of the water due to high mineral content. 

For optimal performance, connect the water supply correctly and eliminate any protective caps. Discard 10-12 glasses of water to purge the system and fully rinse the tank. For best outcomes, use copper tubing for connections, and consult the water treatment facility if issues persist. During the regeneration phase, the buildup of frost and internal sweating can occur. 

Keep humidity levels in mind and regularly clean the unit to prevent breakdowns. This warranty covers defects in materials or workmanship as per the instructions provided.
