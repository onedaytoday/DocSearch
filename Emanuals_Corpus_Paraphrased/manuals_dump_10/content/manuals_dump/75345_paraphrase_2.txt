### Cooking Tips and Guidelines

#### General Cooking Advice
Ensure that food is properly arranged to prevent splashing. Foods such as toast should be placed on high shelves to allow for efficient browning. Preheat the oven and adjust the heat settings accordingly. It's essential to turn food during cooking for even results.

**Note:** Refer to the Service Force Grilling Chart for specific cooking times and shelf placements for various foods.

#### Fan Oven Use
**Preheating:** Always preheat the fan oven before cooking, as it is crucial for achieving recommended temperatures.

**Cooking Temperatures:** Generally, when using the fan oven, reduce the recommended temperatures by about 20-25°C.

#### Batch Baking
When batch baking, ensure items are spaced adequately to allow for proper airflow, especially for cakes and similar items. Avoid placing food too close together as this can affect cooking efficiency.

**Caution:** Never directly cover the fan or restrict airflow, as this could lead to uneven cooking or excessive browning.

#### Roasting and Cooking Charts
Follow the provided charts for roasting and cooking. Adjust time and temperature as needed based on the specific food being prepared. For meats, ensure they reach the appropriate internal temperatures, typically between 160-180°C.

#### Defrost Feature
This function is designed for defrosting foods with frostings or icings. Foods should be thawed completely before cooking to ensure even results. 

**Precautions:** Always cook thoroughly after defrosting and avoid refreezing thawed items.

#### Food Safety Tips
When purchasing food, select the freshest options and minimize exposure to bacteria during reheating, defrosting, or cooling processes. Follow cooking instructions closely to ensure food is heated evenly and thoroughly.

#### Care and Cleaning
Before cleaning, allow the cooling fan to operate until the appliance has cooled down. Avoid using harsh cleaning materials that may damage finishes. 

**Cleaning the Oven:** Follow specific instructions for internal cleaning, using recommended cleaners to avoid damaging coatings.

**Outer Glass Cleaning:** To clean the door glass, carefully remove the outer glass if needed, following safety procedures to prevent breakage. 

#### Light Bulb Replacement
When replacing the oven light bulb, disconnect the power supply first. Carefully remove the cover and replace the bulb with a new one that meets the required specifications.
