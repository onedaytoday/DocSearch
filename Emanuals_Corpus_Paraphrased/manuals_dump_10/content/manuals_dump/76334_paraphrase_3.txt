**Table Function Default Explanation**  
The default settings are displayed for the PC5 BLOCKING settings related to heating and spinning operations without FOM CLS. The service alarm provides information regarding operational hours. The buzzer timeout activates at the end of a process, as well as during a pause. In case of an overload error, a password must be entered. The CMIS address settings do not apply to FOM CLS operations. 

The pressure level is indicated in millimeters (mm) and corresponds to the highest measured software reading, impacting slow filling rates (HG) and accuracy adjustments during operation. 

**Calibration Functionality**  
Speed calibration ranges are defined in the software, correcting RPM display ratios for both low and high values. The adjustment focuses on refining the relationship between the displayed and actual RPMs to improve measurement accuracy.

**Cleaning Procedures**  
Regular cleaning is crucial to maintaining the system's performance by removing lint, threads, and other debris impacting heating efficiency. The cleaning process involves inspecting the incoming hoses and housing, ensuring free flow without obstructions.

All repairs should be conducted by trained personnel to safely handle components such as the switch, hose connections, and bellows. The assembly should ensure no pinched hoses.

For additional maintenance, the standard operating procedures must align with IEC specifications, including routine checks every few months to ensure system integrity and efficiency.

**Temperature Settings and Heating Responses**  
Heating actions are categorized based on specific temperature settings (20C, 40C, 60C, etc.). The system should activate according to predefined thresholds, ensuring optimal heating and cooling processes while adhering to safety standards and cleaning protocols.

**Inspection Guidelines**  
Regular inspections should focus on the mounting system and supply flow, guaranteeing they meet specified clearances and operational standards in compliance with IEC guidelines. This includes verifying that water supply lines are functioning as intended.

This version captures the original content's essence but presents it in a more concise and readable manner.

The following guidelines pertain to the operation of the FOM laboratory and its associated facilities for managing the heating of the BSP. If the internal temperature readings of the FOM exceed or fall below acceptable thresholds, corrective actions may be necessary, including the replacement of parts. 

Make sure to monitor the flow of the FOM system consistently. The system flow should be directed straight from the housing to the appropriate outlets, with adjustments made to the K-factor based on specific supply conditions. If flow rates deviate from expected parameters, follow the outlined procedures for calibration and adjustments.

Cleaning procedures must also be undertaken regularly to ensure optimal performance. Accumulated debris around the heating elements can impede functionality, so thorough cleaning of both the supply hoses and housing is essential. Inspect connections for wear and ensure that all components are correctly assembled to prevent issues with flow or heating efficiency.

The self-clearing motor mechanism should provide reliable fluid removal; however, routine checks are necessary to confirm its proper operation.

Data from the system should be monitored over time and documented to identify any trends or discrepancies in performance. Regular maintenance checks, aligned with IEC specifications, will help to uphold system integrity and functionality.

In summary, adhere to the specified operational and maintenance protocols to ensure that the FOM laboratory runs efficiently and effectively.
