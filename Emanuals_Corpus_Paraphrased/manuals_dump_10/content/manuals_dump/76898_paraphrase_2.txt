To ensure a smooth and correct installation, please follow these straightforward instructions before beginning. Verify that your installation adheres to plumbing, electrical, and other relevant codes. Use this guide as a reference for the fountain installation. Grounding electrical devices like telephones and computers to water lines is a standard practice, which can occur either within or outside the building. This grounding may lead to electrical feedback in the fountain, potentially causing electrolysis that results in a metallic taste or increased metal concentration in the water. To prevent this, use the specified materials. Any drain fittings provided should be plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the buildingâ€™s plumbing system.

Refer to the diagrams indicating water supply connections, waste outlet locations, and mounting instructions. It's imperative that all installations are performed by authorized personnel. Ensure that the wall is adequately reinforced in the designated areas. 

Important Note: When soldering, avoid overheating the tubes inserted into the strainer, as this may damage O-rings. Products require a supply pressure of PSIG; exceeding this may void the warranty. Adjust the water stream height using the provided screws; ensure to tighten them securely.

When installing replacement components, tighten the nut just enough to hold everything in place without over-tightening. For parts inquiries, consult your local distributor or contact Elkay Manufacturing Company.
