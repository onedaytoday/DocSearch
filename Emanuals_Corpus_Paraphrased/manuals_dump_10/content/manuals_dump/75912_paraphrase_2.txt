This document provides essential information and instructions for users, including safety warnings and features of the appliance. It is crucial that individuals, particularly children, are kept away from potential hazards such as suffocation. Proper usage and adherence to these guidelines can prevent accidents, including electric shock or fire risks.

**Warnings:**
1. Ensure that obstructions do not block the appliance's vents to avoid overheating or malfunction. 
2. Cords should not be tampered with or extended improperly to prevent electrical issues.
3. The appliance should only be used in designated environments, away from excessive heat and sunlight.

**Installation and Operation:**
- Before use, allow the appliance to acclimate for at least four hours following installation.
- The recommended operation temperature is around 0°C, with adjustments made according to the load and conditions.
- Be mindful not to overload shelves, as excessive weight can lead to mechanical failure or frost build-up.

**Defrosting:**
- Regularly monitor frost accumulation; defrost when it exceeds a thickness of approximately 5 mm.
- Unplug the appliance before starting defrosting to ensure safety.

**Maintenance:**
- Clean the internal parts and shelves with appropriate cleaning products, ensuring they are dry before restocking.
- Store food items in airtight packaging to maintain freshness and avoid cross-contamination.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the appliance fails to operate correctly, check that all connections are secure and that the door closes properly.
- Should any unusual sounds or issues occur, refer to the troubleshooting section for guidance.

**Technical Specifications:**
- Verify compatibility with local temperature ranges and ensure installation meets the manufacturer’s specifications.
- The rating plate information should be located on the appliance to confirm model specifications.

For further assistance, consult authorized service personnel and adhere to all outlined safety and operational procedures.

The front should be positioned to allow heat sources, such as boilers and sunlight, to be effectively managed from the back. For optimal performance, it is critical that the installation is conducted correctly, with specific components positioned at the top and bottom. Ideally, the configuration should minimize heat exposure to ensure that the shelves can operate efficiently. 

When performing maintenance, be cautious of the power supply; ensure it can be easily accessed. Follow these steps for effective operations: Unscrew the necessary fasteners and remove the covers, ensuring all screws are tightened securely. If adjustments are needed, carefully reposition components, and make sure to tighten them appropriately. Always check the rating plate for correct electrical specifications and ensure the unit is earthed according to regulations.

If the unit is not earthed, it must be treated as a household appliance. Follow local recycling guidelines properly. Responsibility for compliance with E.E.C. Directives lies with the user. For further information on recycling and service, or if needed, please visit www.electrolux.com/shop.
