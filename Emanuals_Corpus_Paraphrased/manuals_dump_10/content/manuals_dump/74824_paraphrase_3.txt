**TURBO/FROSTMATIC Button Overview**

The TURBO/FROSTMATIC feature is designed to rapidly chill fresh food and safeguard previously stored items during the cooling process. Activation occurs by pressing the TURBO/FROSTMATIC button, at which point an indicator light illuminates.

The cooling process takes several hours to reach the desired temperature, and the TURBO/FROSTMATIC function can be manually deactivated if needed. Once activated, the feature will automatically turn off after a specified time, and a sound alert will signal when food has reached the proper temperature.

### Initial Setup
When first starting the appliance, ensure that all settings align with the installation guidelines. The unit should be oriented upright during the setup phase to facilitate optimal operation. The initial light will blink, indicating that the target cooling temperature of -18°C (or lower) has been achieved. Press the ALARM OFF button to deactivate any alerts.

### Selecting Temperature
To adjust the cooling settings, use the appropriate buttons to select your desired temperature. The appliance will confirm changes with an acoustic signal, and the display will indicate the set temperature. For any adjustments, ensure the food is cooled sufficiently to prevent spoilage.

### Memory Function
The appliance maintains temperature memory, meaning it will operate at the last settings used, and the alarms will reset automatically when food temperatures stabilize. If food is left out or thawed, alerts will engage, reminding you of necessary action.

### Storage Tips
To ensure food integrity, pack items air-tight, and utilize recommended cooling practices to enhance freezing efficiency. Prolonged storage above the advised temperature can harm food quality.

### Maintenance and Cleaning
Disconnect the appliance from power for cleaning. Avoid using harsh cleaners that may damage surfaces, and use recommended cleaning agents to maintain functionality. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions
If the appliance malfunctions, refer to the troubleshooting section. Alerts like flashing indicators or warning sounds require immediate attention and should be resolved by qualified service personnel if necessary.

### Cooling Functions and Malfunctions

If the appliance is operating warmer than the desired temperature (above 50°C), refer to the relevant section for troubleshooting. Press the TURBO/FROSTMATIC button as needed. The cooling light will provide a warning; if it is blinking or off, disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply immediately to avoid the risk of electric shock.
