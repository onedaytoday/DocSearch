If the hose connected to the unit is supplied with water, it should be reasonably filled. If the hose is covered with a crumbly material, remedies should be applied. Warning: Do NOT cover the hose with carpeting, as this can lead to a breakdown. Any foulings should be treated as they occur. For any further clarifications, please consult the relevant authority.

**Warning! THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED.** Ensure that the electrical supply is switched on as indicated by its rating. The appliance must be fitted with a rated ASTA (BS1363/A) plug. If any issues arise, refer to the details below. The wires are color-coded: the Earth wire is green/yellow, Neutral is blue, and Live is brown/red. Ensure all connections are secure to avoid any risk of electrical shock. 

If the power supply needs to be replaced, contact Service Force for assistance. Follow proper protocols when handling the electricity supply switch.

The installation must prevent hoses from getting trapped. Prepare and assemble according to the instructions, making sure screws are properly fitted. The recommended thickness of the base should be adhered to, and height adjustments must be made as specified.
