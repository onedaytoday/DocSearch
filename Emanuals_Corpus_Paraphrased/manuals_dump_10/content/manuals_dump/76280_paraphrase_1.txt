The EIMGD60L SS and EIMGD60J IW IQ-Touch models, which include the optional Perfect Steam feature, are designed to accommodate a variety of garment types with an effective capacity. The Perfect Steam function revitalizes and freshens fabrics. These dryers are equipped with a variety of drying cycles, including NSF certification for towels and specialty options for active wear, along with an end-of-cycle chime and a tumble counter. 

Each model can be paired with a suitable pedestal (PN EPWD15SS or PN EPWD15IW) or stacked using the STACKIT4X kit, with compatibility for LP conversion (PN PCK4200). The dryers require a 120V power supply with a grounded three-prong connection, conforming to National (ANSI/NFPA) standards. 

Installation must include sufficient clearance from cabinetry and walls; specific distances for the top, sides, and front are recommended to prevent issues, including airflow restrictions. Itâ€™s crucial to follow installation instructions closely and ensure proper drainage and water supply hose connections. 

Updates to product specifications may occur over time, and the manufacturer reserves the right to make changes without prior notice.
