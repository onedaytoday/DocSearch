### ABOUT THE CERAMIC GLASS COOKTOP

The cooktop is designed with a smooth surface that matches the shape of the cookware. It transfers heat efficiently, requiring flat-bottomed cookware for optimal performance. The type and condition of cookware impact the heat distribution, which can lead to potential burns if the surface gets too hot.

### ABOUT THE RADIANT SURFACE ELEMENTS

These elements heat food evenly and glow red when active. They can be turned on or off to adjust cooking temperatures. Heat levels vary based on wattage, which influences cooking efficiency. 

**NOTE:** The cooktop allows activation and deactivation. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cookware to avoid damage. The Cleaning section provides further guidance.

### COOKWARE MATERIAL TYPES

Proper cookware enhances heating efficiency:

- **ALUMINUM**: Good heat conductor; prone to scratching.
- **COPPER**: Excellent heat conduction.
- **STAINLESS STEEL**: Versatile and easy to clean.
- **CAST IRON**: Retains heat well but takes longer to heat.
- **PORCELAIN-ENAMEL METAL**: Smooth but can scratch easily.
- **GLASS**: Not recommended due to scratching.

The factory setting is 12-Hour mode, and if the light is engaged for the Sabbath, it will be turned OFF in the same manner. Note that while the Sabbath feature is active, only BAKE is permitted. To start, set to a minimum of 350°F and press **START**.

### USING THE SELF-CLEAN FEATURE
Before cleaning, ensure the oven has cooled down. Wear protective gear during manual cleaning. The self-cleaning feature operates at high temperatures, so do not interrupt or cancel the process prematurely, as this can lead to damage. Clean the oven cavity using appropriate methods, avoiding harsh chemicals or abrasive substances that could scratch.

To start the self-clean cycle, select the duration (2, 3, or 4 hours) for the UPPER OVEN, then press **START**. During the cleaning phase, the DOOR will lock, and ash will accumulate. Wait approximately one hour post-cleaning for the oven to cool before attempting to open the door.

### GENERAL CLEANING
Ensure the oven is OFF and cool before cleaning. Promptly remove spills and heavy soiling to minimize the need for extensive cleaning later. Use recommended cleaners for different surfaces—avoid abrasive materials that could damage finishes. Regularly clean the oven to maintain its condition.

### DOOR REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT
To remove the oven door, leverage the hinges located at the front by lifting and rotating them. Follow the special care instructions to avoid scratching or damaging the door and ensure a proper fit.

### OVEN LIGHT
The oven light can be independently operated using the switch located on the appliance. Ensure the glass shield covering the light is in place when the oven is operational. To replace the shield, make sure the oven is cool and take appropriate safety measures.

### COOKTOP CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE
For the cooktop, use appropriate cleaning methods to avoid scratches or damage. Allow the surface to cool before cleaning. Follow manufacturer recommendations for the best results with ceramic glass surfaces and avoid using abrasive materials to maintain integrity.

### Cleaning Guidelines for the Ceramic Glass Cooktop

**Cautions:** To prevent damage, avoid using cookware with high heat retention properties immediately after turning off the cooktop, and avoid using scouring pads or harsh cleaners like bleach on the surface, as these can scratch it. Allow the cooktop to cool before cleaning. 

Adhere to proper preheating procedures to ensure even cooking when preparing items such as cookies, bread, or cakes. Avoid overcrowding the cooktop or using excessively high heat, as this can lead to warping or poor cooking results. Monitor the temperature closely to prevent overheating.

**Common Issues:**
1. **Control Beeping/Error Codes:** If an error code appears, press the CANCEL button to reset. If the issue persists, consult an authorized servicer.
2. **Oven Failure to Operate:** Ensure that the house power supply is connected. Inspect for blown fuses or tripped breakers, and confirm that all connections, including the cord, are secure.
3. **Oven Light Malfunctions:** If the oven light is not functioning, it may require a bulb replacement.

**Self-Cleaning Cycle Problems:** If the self-cleaning feature is not working, ensure the oven door is closed and follow the instructions carefully. Excessive smoke during broiling may indicate meat placement issues; adjust as necessary to ensure adequate clearance. When broiling, do not cover meat, which can impede proper cleaning.

**Residual Soil Issues:** If food soil remains after a self-cleaning cycle, it may require manual cleaning with recommended products.

**Cooking Performance Issues:** Adjust cooking times and cookware types as needed for optimal results. Avoid lightweight or warped cookware, as these can lead to uneven cooking and flames inside the oven.

**Surface Damage:** For scratches and abrasions, use only recommended cleaning agents and avoid abrasive materials. Brown streaks and discoloration may require specialized cleaning techniques.
