**Installation Instructions Overview:**

To secure the top shelf, ensure it is positioned with the opening facing upward. Use the template as a guide for correct placement, referencing the 'B' mark during the process. The specified dimensions must align with the charcoal filter installed. Cooking clearance can be verified through the 'Clearance Heights' section, and the template assists with identifying the necessary mounting points.

**Fixing Assembly Step:**

Begin by attaching the assembly using screws (labeled S). Ensure they are tightened adequately, dividing them proportionally into thirds for stability. Before proceeding, confirm the assembly orientation to optimize access to electrical and cooking connections—either on the left or right side.

**Ducting Setup:**

To install the ducting, feed component (D) through the designated slot (X), ensuring a tight connection with round screws. Unscrew the backing from the assembly to remove any obstructions surrounding the ducting area (F). Follow through by securing the installation with the provided screws. 

**Final Assembly Adjustments:**

For securing the assembly and surrounding framework, ensure the connections are directed appropriately based on your preferred orientation. Use screws (V1) and (V2) to adjust and secure the ducting components (F2) to the main assembly. It's imperative that all connections are tight and properly aligned for optimal function.

**Cover Installation:**

Finalizing the installation requires securing the cover with four screws. After completion, verify that all terminals are correctly positioned and that the charcoal and grease management systems are functioning effectively.
