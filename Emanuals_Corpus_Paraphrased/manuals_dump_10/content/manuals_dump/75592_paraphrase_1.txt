### Technical Overview of Chilling Process

**10GN1/1 Chilling Unit**: This unit efficiently chills cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly reducing bacterial growth within a four-hour timeframe. Further freezing to -18°C is achievable, allowing the food to be stored for several months at these temperatures, extending its shelf life.

**Operating Modes**: The machine operates in several modes: 
- **Soft Chilling** (2°C)
- **Shock Chilling** (up to -18°C)

The chilling process is activated automatically, ensuring continuous cooling. The unit complies with NF and UK regulations and includes built-in UV functionality as an accessory. It features a countdown display for service and temperature information.

**Temperature Regulation**: The system is designed to maintain a temporary holding phase at -14°C, transitioning to -36°C or -40°C as needed. The active cooling information is logged to meet HACCP standards, ensuring safe food handling even if the unit operates abnormally.

**Construction and Specifications**: 
- The chilling unit is designed with a pitch configuration for GN (Gastronorm) compatibility and is constructed from high-quality AISI stainless steel with polyurethane insulation. 
- It meets various regulatory standards, including NF and D.I.N., and integrates built-in thermostats and thermometers.

**Included Accessories**: 
- Dual and single sensor probes for monitoring temperature.
- Tray racks and trolleys designed for 50 kg capacity.
- Additional HACCP compliance kits, various grid styles for storage, and a printer for basic HACCP documentation.

**Installation**: The setup is designed for easy plumbing and cleaning, maintaining high hygienic standards as certified by AFAQ AFNOR. The unit's design features rounded corners for safety and ease of maintenance, with IP20 protection for internal components.

This overview underscores the efficiency and safety features of the 10GN1/1 chilling unit, establishing it as a valuable tool for food preservation in compliance with industry standards.
