**Technical Paraphrase:**

The washing instructions include options such as "Wool" and "Handwash," which aim to minimize creasing and damage during the laundering process. You can select the appropriate cycle for items that require gentle care. The cycle reduces the agitation and provides a hand-wash-like effect. For optimal results, set the temperature to around 30°C, ensuring compatibility with the fabric type.

Before beginning any cleaning process, disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines carefully to avoid any hazards. Regular maintenance is recommended, including cleaning the lint catch and inspecting the unit for blockages at the nozzle and recess areas.

If the machine cools down and requires draining, disconnect the hose first. Remove any obstructions from the emptying hose, and ensure that all connections are secure. If cleaning issues persist, service may be necessary. Fluctuating indicators such as warning lights can signal a malfunction, prompting a need for troubleshooting.

Ensure that the correct operational parameters are followed to promote efficient cleaning. If there are persistent issues with dish distribution or ineffective washing, manual redistribution may be necessary.

Referencing technical specifications, it’s important to adhere to the national safety standards for installation, including ensuring proper earthing. Compliance with directive EEC regulations is crucial for proper function.
