**Technical Positioning and Protection**

This guide provides essential information regarding the safe operation and proper functioning of the washer. It includes warnings, troubleshooting tips, and details about your warranty. Ensure you read and understand these instructions, especially regarding water protection and emptying.

**Water Supply and Protection**

The washer incorporates backflow protection compliant with AS/NZS standards. For safety, ensure that the water supply is free-flowing and that all hoses are correctly connected. Use only approved hoses and do not repurpose old ones. Follow the installation guidelines to prevent any blockages and ensure proper drainage. 

**Hose Installation**

Ensure that the installation does not obstruct access and that the hoses are not excessive in length. If necessary, purchase compatible connecting hoses rather than extending existing ones. Position hoses appropriately to avoid malfunction and ensure they are properly grounded. NOTE: Do not use an extension cord.

**Operation and Treatment Options**

This washer features various settings, including temperature control up to 60°C, which helps to reduce thermal shock. Utilize the ECO mode to save energy. The compartment settings allow for washing performance adjustments like prewashing and starching. 

**Sorting and Washing Guidelines**

Sort laundry into categories: whites, colors, synthetics, towels, and heavy items. Refer to care labels and the provided charts for guidance. Avoid mixing whites with colored items to maintain brightness and prevent color transfer. Treat stubborn stains before washing for optimal results.

**Using Additives and Detergents**

Measure detergent and additives according to the type of wash and guidelines provided. Overloading the washer or using too much detergent can lead to subpar cleaning results. 

**Safety and Maintenance**

Keep children away from the washer to prevent accidents and potential suffocation hazards. Regularly check hoses for wear or damage and perform maintenance as recommended, ensuring safety during usage.

For troubleshooting, monitoring progress through indicator lights is advised, and follow the prompts as specified to rectify any issues.

Ensure compliance with all operating instructions for effective and safe washing.

To initiate operation, select the desired function and adjust the settings. When activated, the indicator light will flash. To pause the operation, press the designated button. If the light is flashing and the temperature is set to 55°C, it indicates a specific mode is active. Should a selection require adjustments, navigate through the options accordingly. Various settings are available for different fabric types, including white cottons, colored items, and synthetics. 

For intensive washing cycles, you can choose options such as pre-wash, rinse hold, quick wash, and stain reduction. Ensure that additional items do not exceed capacity, and utilize the rinse hold option if necessary. 

In case of emergencies where the unit needs to be drained, ensure it is unplugged and follow the procedure for emptying the hose. Regular maintenance includes inspecting the hose for blockages and cleaning using appropriate tools.

For troubleshooting, monitor indicator lights for possible faults. Common issues may stem from improper hose connections or overloading. Consult the service instructions for resolution steps.
