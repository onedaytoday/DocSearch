### Cooking Operations Guide

**Cooking Overview**  
Cooking refers to the process of preparing food, which ideally begins with preheating the appliance to the specified temperature. Preheating ensures that the cooking environment is at the correct heat level before placing food inside. This step is critical as it often affects the quality of the final dish. Always consult a cooking chart for the recommended temperatures and cooking times.

**Batch Cooking**  
When batch cooking, utilize the designated function to ensure even cooking. The light indicator will signal when the process is active. Focus on arranging cookware properly and using suitable cooking functions for different types of food, whether they require direct cooking or preheating.

**Grilling and Roasting Guidelines**  
Follow grilling charts for specific food types, noting that shelf positioning and food thickness are key factors in cooking evenly. Roasting times and temperatures vary according to the type of meat and its size. Use an internal thermometer to check that meats reach safe cooking temperatures (e.g., 50-60°C for rare, 70-80°C for well done). 

**Cavity Management and Cleaning**  
Ensure proper airflow by spacing foods appropriately and avoiding overcrowding in the cooking chamber. Maintain hygiene by allowing the oven to cool before cleaning, using compatible cleaners to preserve the surface finish. Remove shelves carefully and wash them as necessary. Avoid abrasive materials that could damage the finish.

**Troubleshooting Tips**  
If cooking is uneven, check that the appliance settings are correctly adjusted and that the shelf positions adhere to guidelines. Replace any faulty indicators and verify the clock settings. For defrosting, use the appropriate functions and avoid refreezing thawed foods to ensure safety.

**Safety Precautions**  
Always monitor cooking times closely and be cautious when handling hot equipment. Ensure that the appliance is disconnected when not in use and follow specific cleaning procedures to maintain appliance performance.

By maintaining these guidelines, you can ensure optimal results in your cooking endeavors.

### Assembly and Cleaning Instructions

Ensure the assembly is cleaned prior to installation. Use household cleaners, bleaches, or bathroom/sink cleaners for the outer surfaces. Clean thoroughly to preserve the integrity of painted finishes. Carefully clean both the inner and outer areas, paying attention to the rear location.

When handling, use one hand to support the rear while using the other to clean the outer surfaces. If any chipping or scratching occurs, it may cause further damage. For assistance, contact a qualified service provider.
