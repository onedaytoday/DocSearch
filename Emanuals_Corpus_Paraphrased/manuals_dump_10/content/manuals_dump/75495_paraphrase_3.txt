**Switching Off Function**

To switch off the cooking function, use the Touch panel to select the cooking mode and the Heating-Up Function. The system features four cooking levels, ranging from the lowest heat to the highest heat.

When activated, the Heating-Up Function rapidly increases the temperature before reverting to the previously selected heat setting. The current temperature is displayed on the panel. If the operation initially indicates a higher heat setting, the system will adjust appropriately based on the selected heating level.

If switched off during cooking, the system indicates this status, and a light signals when the cooking field is inactive. The temperature setting is shown when the cooking field is cool. Itâ€™s essential to monitor the temperature closely to prevent food from burning.

The On/Off button controls the cooking mode, including a child lock feature for safety. To deactivate this lock, hold the appropriate button until it is released. If the cooking process reaches a preset duration, the system will shut down automatically.

**Timer Function**

Utilize the TIMER field to manage cooking durations. This allows users to set the cooking time, which will automatically turn off the appliance once the set time elapses. Alerts accompany this automatic shutoff to inform the user.

**Operational Guidelines**

To quickly adjust or reset cooking settings, touch the designated field. The system will visually indicate any active cooking modes. If conflicting settings are detected, the correct operation should be ensured by following the user guide.

**Cleaning and Maintenance of Induction Cooktops**

Induction cooktops require specific cleaning techniques due to their rapid heating capabilities. Regular surface cleaning is necessary, as food residues can adhere strongly to the cooktop. Use suitable cleaning products and implement them while the surface is still warm but not hot.

For tougher grime or burnt-on residues, let the surface cool down before cleaning. Avoid using abrasive materials that may scratch the surface. Always check for proper functionality following cleaning.

**Troubleshooting Issues**

If any operational problems arise, follow the troubleshooting instructions provided. For significant issues that remain unresolved, contact customer service for assistance. Never attempt repairs without proper guidance, as this may void warranties or lead to further complications.

All installations must adhere to the relevant safety and EMC directives (such as EN regulations). Proper grounding and electrical connections are essential for safe operation. Reference the provided installation guidelines to ensure compliance with local regulations. 

These steps are critical for maintaining the integrity and safety of the appliance while ensuring optimal cooking performance.
