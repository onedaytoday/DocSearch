### Important Safety Information
Ensure that the cooker hood is connected to existing electrical systems compatible with the specified regulations (BS.6172, BS.5440, BS.6891, BS.5482). If the unit becomes overheated or a malfunction occurs, switch it off and allow it to cool completely.

### Appliance Operating Instructions
To optimize performance, utilize the hood with the appropriate charcoal filter. Regularly turn on the extraction during cooking to eliminate grease and odors. Ensure the hood is regularly maintained; grease filters should be cleaned monthly, while charcoal filters need replacement every three months or sooner if heavily utilized. 

### Maintenance and Cleaning
For filter replacement, first detach the grease filter by pressing the release catch. Charcoal filters can be rotated and removed as indicated. Clean filters by hand or place them in a dishwasher, and allow them to dry prior to reinstallation.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure safe and effective use of your Electrolux cooker hood.

To secure the first component as illustrated, or from the top of the assembly, use the supplied fixing screws as shown. Adjust the height based on the specifications. For the optional splashback installation, ensure it is positioned at the designated height (B) and aligned correctly. Secure the splashback using the provided fixing screws.

If the splashback is to be installed with a free-standing cooker, ensure both the top and side fixing screws are utilized. For hollow or solid boards, use the supplied fixing screws.

Adjust the top screws to facilitate proper installation, as indicated in the section titled "ELECTRICAL CONNECTION." Ensure the ducting aligns with the required standards, such as British or DIN 4102-B1 for fire safety. 

For charcoal extraction, the appropriate ducting must be fitted. The duct should minimize bends and maintain a short route for optimal performance. If the ducting is longer than recommended, efficiency may be compromised. 

If the cooker is vented outdoors, ensure it is appropriately sealed to prevent any gas or heating issues. 

The chimney assembly is composed of various components. Begin with the specified section (S), adjusting as needed for installation. Secure it using the four screws as indicated in section (I), ensuring stability throughout the process.
