**General Cleaning:** Use a cloth to clean surfaces and tracks. For items in the dishwasher, ensure they are placed correctly and clean regularly. 

**Vacation Preparation:** When moving items for short vacations, turn off cooling systems and unplug cords. Clean thoroughly to avoid any build-up of food debris. If using a handcart, handle items carefully to prevent scratching. Use a smooth cloth to wipe surfaces, opting for household cleaners where necessary, and exercise caution with ammonia-based cleaners.

**Light Bulb Replacement:** Ensure both fresh food and light sections are adequately lit. For safety, wear protection when changing bulbs or handling covers. Unscrew the light cover carefully and replace bulbs as needed. Check specifications to avoid using incompatible bulbs.

**Troubleshooting:** If experiencing cooling issues or service interruptions, review the following points:
- Ensure the cooling unit is turned on and properly plugged in.
- Check for blown fuses or tripped circuits.
- Verify that the food sections (fresh and freezer) are clean and in good condition.
- Allow time for the unit to cool and avoid overloading it with items, as this can affect performance.

**Temperature Issues:** If food is too cold:
- Adjust the settings as necessary, and allow time for the temperature to stabilize.
- For meats, ensure they are stored at correct temperatures and check for ice crystals, which indicate freezing.

**Moisture and Frost Issues:** 
- If water or frost accumulates, check that the unit is properly sealed and that no external factors are causing excess moisture.
- Reduce the frequency of door openings to maintain internal temperature.

**Ice Production Problems:** 
- Ensure the water supply is connected properly and not restricted. Check for blockages and ensure the ice-making tray is seated correctly.
- If ice production is low, consider adjusting the water supply and check for any clogs.

**Light Functionality Issues:** 
- If lights are not functioning, check for burned-out bulbs or switches. Ensure that the light cover is in place and that the switch is operational.
