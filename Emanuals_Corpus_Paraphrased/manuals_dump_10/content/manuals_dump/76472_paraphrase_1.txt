**Dishwasher User Manual Overview**

**Welcome to Your Dishwasher**
This section introduces the initial features and offerings of your selected dishwasher model. It includes essential product information, technical specifications, and customer service details intended to enhance user understanding and operational efficiency.

**Product Information**
This manual presents crucial details about the dishwasher, including its various functions and operational hints. Proper adherence to these instructions ensures safe and effective use of the appliance. The dishwasher is designed for household use and should only be serviced by authorized professionals. Caution is advised to prevent electrical hazards and burns, particularly related to mouth and throat. Ensure children are kept away from the appliance to avoid choking hazards.

**Operational Features**
The On/Off selection buttons illuminate to indicate the activation or deactivation of specific functions. Note that all lights will operate only when the corresponding function is active. This will help troubleshoot any malfunction notifications. 

To activate or deactivate functions, you must press the On/Off button. Ensure all associated lights respond appropriately during this process. For factory settings or troubleshooting, follow the instructions provided in this manual.

**Water Hardness and Supply Management**
Your dishwasher's operation may be influenced by the hardness of your water supply, measured in TH (French hardness). It is advisable to check with your local water authority for precise measurements and recommendations.

Cleaning settings can be adjusted manually or electronically, depending on the model's specifications. 

**Loading Guidelines**
To ensure optimal cleaning results, proper loading of dishes and cutlery is essential:

- Place delicate items such as mother-of-pearl or specific stoneware in designated areas.
- Position cutlery vertically with handles facing upward for effective cleaning.
- Avoid overcrowding to prevent items from blocking spray arms.

For optimal performance, rinse off any stubborn food residues before using the dishwasher, and load items so they do not cover each other. Adjust the racks accordingly to accommodate larger items.

**Cleaning Functions**
The dishwasher includes prewash and combined cleaning modes. Selecting these functions can enhance cleaning efficiency, deactivate specific water inflows, and indicate status through indicator lights.

Adjust the desired function as needed and ensure proper activation for effective cleaning results. 

By following these guidelines and operational tips, you can maximize the performance and longevity of your dishwasher.

Please select the appropriate settings, ensuring the countdown timer accurately reflects your choices. Press the On/Off button on the dishwasher to initiate the automatic process. The selected hours will flash on the display, indicating the countdown is active. Once the cycle begins, a point-shaped light will illuminate under the appliance. For flush-mounted installations, ensure correct fitting.

**Important:** When operating the dishwasher, avoid interruptions. If the cycle is disrupted, press the buttons and check that lights are functioning correctly. The dishwasher will notify you of its status. After usage, allow time for the dishes and the appliance to cool down before unloading. Empty the dishwasher first and be cautious when handling; the dishes may still be hot.

The dishwasher has various settings for cleaning crockery and cutlery, including light and heavy washes between 50°C and 65°C. Normal or light loads are suitable for family use, and prewash cycles can reach temperatures up to 70°C to combat food residue effectively.

To maintain the dishwasher, unlock the lid and turn it counterclockwise to clean the interior thoroughly, ensuring all parts are compatible and reassembled correctly without forcing them into place. Never operate the dishwasher if parts are not securely in position, as this may lead to malfunctions.

If your dishwasher experiences issues indicated by flashing lights, check for correct assembly or other troubleshooting tips from the user manual. Always consult a qualified technician if problems persist.

**Safety Warning:** If the temperature drops below 0°C, turn off the machine and ensure hoses are appropriately secured to prevent damage. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that may scratch surfaces. 

Technical specifications for the dishwasher, including water supply and capacity ratings, can be found in the user manual. Ensure that your plumbing meets the required standards for installation. Only connect the dishwasher with suitable hoses and fittings to avoid leaks or operational issues. 

Make sure the dishwasher is properly grounded and that electrical ratings are compatible with the supply to prevent overheating or fire hazards. Dispose of the appliance responsibly at a recycling facility following local regulations. For additional guidance on disposal, contact your local waste management service.
