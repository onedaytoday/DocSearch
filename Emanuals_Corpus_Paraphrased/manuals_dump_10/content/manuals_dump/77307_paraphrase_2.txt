**November AM Section: Optional Connections and Troubleshooting Specifications**

To initiate device connection, begin by aligning the connectors at the top and gently pushing them in until they click into place. Ensure that you reach the rear connectors effectively. When attaching the optional USB and right-angle VGA cables, ensure the device is powered off.

To release the LCD, first, press the release buttons located on the back. Next, unscrew the four screws securing the LCD. When securing the base, use a thumbscrew or appropriate screwdriver, ensuring the mounting is facing the correct direction before tightening.

Adjust the LCD height to your preference; the factory setting is adjustable. To increase height, turn the screw clockwise; to decrease, turn counterclockwise.
