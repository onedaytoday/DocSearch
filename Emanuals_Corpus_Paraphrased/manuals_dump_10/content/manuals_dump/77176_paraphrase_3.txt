**Model 7173N2 Car Radio with Cassette Player Instruction Manual**

**Safety Instructions**  
This manual provides essential safety warnings regarding the operation of this car radio and cassette player. To mitigate the risk of electric shock, avoid removing the front or rear covers, as no user-serviceable parts are present inside. Refer any maintenance to qualified technicians. Battery disposal must comply with local regulations, and ensure the device is not within children's reach, as high volume can damage hearing.

**Warnings**  
- Electric shock risk—do not open the unit.
- Ensure proper ventilation to avoid overheating.
- Protect from exposure to moisture and foreign objects.

**Mounting and Wiring**  
When installing the unit, ensure all connections are secure and not exposed to potential short circuits. Use appropriately rated wiring to prevent any performance issues.

**Functionality Overview**  
The radio provides both AM and FM reception, with a clear display for tuning. Controls include volume adjustment, function selection (tape/radio), and a fast-forward/eject feature. 

**Troubleshooting**  
For any performance issues, checking the supply connections and speaker wiring is recommended before seeking technical assistance. Regular cleaning is also advised to maintain optimal functionality.

**Maintenance**  
Keep the unit clean and free of obstructions. Use a soft cloth for maintenance, avoiding harsh chemicals. Overheating may occur if ventilation is inadequate, so ensure the unit is not enclosed in a confined space. 

This manual should be kept for future reference, with all safety guidelines strictly followed to ensure the longevity and proper operation of your car radio.

**Controls and Functions for Volume Control**

The ON/OFF switch operates the volume. To turn it on, rotate the knob clockwise; continue turning right to increase the volume, and turn left to decrease it. 

**Tuning Frequency Indicator**

The display shows the currently tuned frequency for either FM (VHF) or AM (MW). The AM (MW) band is activated when the button is not pressed, while the FM (VHF) band is selected when the button is pushed.

**Tuning Stations**

Use the tuning knob to select stations on AM (MW) or FM (VHF). For fast-forward and eject functions, press the FF EJ button—this will eject the cassette when pressed.

**Cassette Slot and Playback**

The cassette slot is used for playback, indicated by the TAPE LED. The RADIO LED illuminates when the radio is operational. To operate, turn the control knob clockwise to switch on, whereupon the TAPE LED will light up during playback. To switch off, turn the knob counterclockwise until it locks. 

**Power Supply**

Power is supplied at +12V. Adjusting the knob to the right increases the volume to its maximum, and turning to the left decreases it to the minimum. 

**Search Functionality**

Using the AM and FM buttons while turning the knob allows for station searching; clockwise for increasing (UP) or counter-clockwise for decreasing (DN). When a tape is played, the TAPE LED will light up until the end of the tape is reached, at which point playback will stop automatically, and the RADIO LED will illuminate.

**Ejecting Cassette**

Pressing the FF EJ button completely stops playback; the cassette will be automatically ejected afterward.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

Use a soft cloth for cleaning. Do not use thinners or other harsh substances.

**Troubleshooting Guide**

In case of issues, check for wire short circuits, ensure correct wiring connections, and verify that sound interferences are addressed. If problems persist, consult a technical service.
