### DELAY TIMER Instructions

To set the DELAY TIMER, choose your desired hours and press the DELAY TIMER button. Once engaged, the corresponding light will illuminate, indicating the selected hour. To turn off the DELAY TIMER, press the START/PAUSE button. You can also increase the delay hours during the PRE-WASH phase by pressing the same button repeatedly.

For additive usage, follow the specific instructions for compartments, such as for in-wash treatments (powders/tablets with the STAIN option), pre-wash, soaking treatments, or starch. Make sure to adhere to the MAX fill levels specified.

Press the START/PAUSE button to initiate the cycle. If the DOOR/LIGHT flashes, check to ensure the door is securely closed. The cycle time will count down, and you can adjust the DELAY TIMER settings if needed during this phase.

### Cycle Completion and Security

When the cycle reaches completion, the END light will activate. If the EASY IRON option is selected, the anti-creasing phase will follow. If you choose RINSE HOLD, either pause the cycle or opt to DRAIN or SPIN as needed to finish the cycle. Always ensure the DOOR/LIGHT indicator shows that the door is securely locked before starting or stopping any cycles.

### Troubleshooting

If issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting section. Ensure all connections, like hoses, are properly secured and not obstructed. If water supply indicators appear, check connections, and make sure the hose is not kinked or blocked. Any flashing ERROR codes should prompt immediate attention.

In case of excessive foam or incorrect washing results, confirm the right detergent quantity is used, and assess the machine settings accordingly. Consult with Service Force for persistent issues or repairs.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance. Clean the machine's exterior and interior compartments using suitable non-abrasive cleaners. Ensure the emptying hose is clear and correctly positioned. Always disconnect the power before performing maintenance to ensure safety.

### Additional Feature: RINSE+

The RINSE+ feature enhances rinsing for specific fabric types. To activate, select the desired fabric setting (COTTONS/LINEN, EASY-CARES, EASY IRON, or DELICATES), hold the RINSE button until the indicator flashes, then release. This function can be combined with SHORT SPIN to ensure thorough rinsing. 

Follow all safety instructions and user guidelines to maintain efficiency and fabric care.

### Water Cooling Instructions

To activate the water cooling function for COTTONS/LINEN or EASY-CARE fabrics, set the machine to SHORT SPIN. Press and hold the PRE-WASH button for a minimum of a few seconds until the MAIN WASH light starts flashing. Release the PRE-WASH button, and while the MAIN WASH light is still flashing, the cooling function will start. If cooling is desired, repeat the process: set to SHORT SPIN, press and hold PRE-WASH until the MAIN WASH flashes, then release PRE-WASH.

### Protection Instructions

Protection features can be enabled or disabled by pressing the START/PAUSE button, along with the PRE-WASH and SENSITIVE buttons, simultaneously for a few seconds. The Protection active light will flash for a moment, indicating that the Protection is engaged. Once the cycle is complete, the Protection can be released.
