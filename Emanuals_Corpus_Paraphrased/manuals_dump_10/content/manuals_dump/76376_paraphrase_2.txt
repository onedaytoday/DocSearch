**Washing Instructions:**

Follow the instructions carefully for sorting laundry. Separate items into categories: whites, coloreds, synthetics, and other types such as towels, tablecloths, and bed sheets. Wash whites and colored items together on a cold setting. It’s essential to wash new colored items separately first, as they can affect the whiteness of your whites. Include lightly soiled white items and synthetics where appropriate.

Use bleach only on whites and coloreds as per the guidelines. For stubborn stains, treat items overnight with a stain remover based on grease and fabric type before washing. Use the appropriate temperature settings for each fabric type as indicated in the washing chart – generally, 60°C is recommended for most items except for delicates.

Conduct regular maintenance on your washing machine following the manufacturer’s instructions to prevent malfunctioning. Ensure that your laundry is not overloaded, as this can reduce washing efficiency. Always inspect hoses for blockages and clean them as necessary.

**Safety Precautions:**

Ensure to disconnect your machine from the power supply before cleaning or performing maintenance. Keep hoses free from ice if temperatures drop below 0°C. In case of troubleshooting, refer to the error codes or acoustic signals to determine issues with your machine. 

For any service inquiries, please contact customer support. Ensure all installations comply with local regulations and standards, and properly dispose of hazardous materials like electrical components.

**Sorting and Washing:**
