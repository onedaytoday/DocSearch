### Fresh Food Storage and Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain optimal conditions for fresh food storage, avoid overcrowding shelves, which can impede proper air circulation and cooling. Ensure that meat and other perishable foods are stored securely and not exposed to heat sources such as dishwashers or heating appliances. This will help minimize spoilage and maintain food quality.

### Temperature Control and Management

Consult the "Setting the Temperature Control" section to avoid overcrowding and ensure effective cooling. Allow sufficient space for airflow to prevent heat build-up and degradation of food items. For short vacations lasting over three months, unplug the appliance and clean it thoroughly. Store food items securely, and clean removable shelves and containers to minimize residue build-up.

When cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off to prevent accidental activation of LED lights or other features. Use a soft cloth—avoiding abrasive cleansers or scrubbing brushes that could scratch surfaces. Employ household cleaners that do not contain bleach and follow the recommended cleaning protocols.

Common appliance concerns may include improper cooling or temperature fluctuations. Ensure the appliance is level, properly sealed, and that the door is functioning correctly. Inspect for any obstructions and check if the appliance is in control lock mode, which may require a reset. 

If you hear unusual sounds, such as cracking or increased operational noise, it may indicate normal cooling processes or the need for maintenance. Refer to the “Common Concerns” section for additional troubleshooting steps.
