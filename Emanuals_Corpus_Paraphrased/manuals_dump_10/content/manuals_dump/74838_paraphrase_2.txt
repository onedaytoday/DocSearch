### Oil Care Instructions

To manage the oil, switch to the cooling mode. Position the valve correctly and unscrew the collection valve counterclockwise to allow oil to drain into the collection container. Clean the trough and the surrounding area thoroughly before covering it.

### Changing the Frying Oil

When the oil quality diminishes, proceed as follows: Switch to the cooling mode and allow the trough to cool down. Then, open the valve to drain the oil into a collection container, ensuring no residue remains.

### Cleaning Protocol

The cleaning process should occur when the unit has cooled down. Turn off the valve and let the trough cool (approximately 30 minutes). Clean the cover and collection container, and then thoroughly clean the trough with a lint-free cloth. The valve should be wiped down appropriately. Use a spray or high-pressure cleaner for more extensive cleaning, focusing on the front area. Ordinary cleaner can suffice for regular maintenance to prevent buildup.

### Shutdown Instructions

Before performing maintenance, ensure the unit is turned off where temperatures are below 32°F (0°C). Wipe the trough to apply a thin protective coating regularly.

### Malfunction Troubleshooting

In case of a malfunction: 
- If the heating element fails, the Safety Thermal Break (STB) may trip due to overheating.
- A defective heating element may cause insufficient heating.
- If the control light remains on, check for short circuits, and contact service if needed.
- Potential causes include a faulty thermostat or ON-OFF switch that may require professional attention.

For any significant issues, please reach out to the service provider using the provided contact details.
