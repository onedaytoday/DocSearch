The AX150 supports a range of Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) and is compatible with switches such as the SB305008AE, SB140410AJE, DS3250VL2E, DS220BFFD, DS210BDEU, and DS210BDE. These HBAs can connect via switches or directly to the SAN, but cannot connect both directly and through a switch simultaneously. For instance, ISL (Inter-Switch Link) connections allow communication between switches. It is important to ensure that the HBAs and cluster nodes are configured properly for operations and that primary and secondary connections to the Storage Processors (SPs) are established correctly.

Connections to the AX150 are facilitated using standard SCSI or similar interfaces. EMC recommends that the setup should utilize compatible paths defined between the HBAs and SPs either directly or via switches. The remote replication functionality with EMC SAN Copy software can be utilized to ensure that data from branch offices is backed up efficiently.

For detailed compatibility, refer to the connectivity specifications for a variety of HP Proliant and other server models, including various series (G2, G3, G4) across a range of configurations. For instance, configurations include PCI and SCSI interfaces associated with models like HPQ Proliant, IBM servers, NEC systems, and more. Specific details, such as model identifiers and HBA types, are outlined to ensure proper installation and optimal performance with the AX150.

**Topology Overview for IBM Systems and EMC Compatibility**

The IBM HS21, HS21 XM, LS21, and LS41 models support SAN booting with the DMMPIO software. For reliable booting from EMC devices, ensure compatibility with the connectivity provided by the SAN, utilizing the Path Software section of PowerPath. EFI support is required for effective booting, and confirming both the HBA and FC switch configurations (as specified in the BIOS) is essential.

The following Linux versions are supported: OEL 2.6.942.x; 2.6.978.x; and 2.6.967.x, as per the integrated BIOS specifications. Confirm compatibility with the necessary configurations for both integrated and external HBAs.

For EMC systems, please confirm the necessary features in the BIOS for rack-mountable ESM and configurations for high-speed connections. The IBM MultiSwitch and specific low-profile HBAs, such as the QLA2340, are recommended for efficient performance.

The PowerPath software is compatible with various versions of Microsoft hotfixes (QFE) for ESX booting, and EMC emphasizes booting procedures via integrated BIOS settings. 

Supported HP ProLiant models include the DL320, DL360, and various ML series, configured for RHEL U7 and U8 AS/ES. Ensure that the relevant HBA models, such as those from QLogic, meet the specific requirements for each configuration and BIOS version to maintain compatibility.

### Switch Compatibility and Configuration Information

**Models:** SB140410AJE, SB305008AE

**Hops in ISLs**: The InterSwitch Links (ISLs) are essential for connecting input to output on the active ISL or switch. This documentation provides data to evaluate the quantity of ISLs related to the EMC Topology Switch Application Revision. 

To ensure compatibility, align lower-level switches with a higher Application Revision. Only revisions related to the highest switch must be considered. The topology encompasses switches from both IBM chassis and configurations involving the IBM Multiswitch (39Y9314), in addition to the HP AE373A SAN Switch. 

**Specifications**: This switch is categorized as VL2 LC, which is compatible with the DS220BFFD, DS210BDE, and DS210BDEU switches. Consult further documentation for additional details.

**SAN Connectivity**: The EMC Topology Connectivity suggests that all revisions of the switches must be accounted for in the switched topology structure. This includes a configuration that outlines compatibility between three switches (A, B, and C), denoting their respective firmware (Y for switch B, Z for switch C) and ensuring cohesion amongst all three.

**Components and OEM Notes**: Each switch and director, along with optics, must adhere to specified guidelines. The document assumes compatibility with EMC Wave and Short Wave optics; however, switches will be labeled as 'end-of-service-life' if they reach specified revisions. 

The supported switches include models such as:

- **FC Switch (SW3014)**

**Inter-Switch Links (ISLs):**
- ISLs facilitate connections between switches and are critical for topology configurations.
- The count of ISLs will impact the performance and connectivity of the network.

**Application Revisions:**
- It is essential to align switch application revisions; a lower-level switch should not be used with a higher application revision.
- Use the highest revision associated with each switch to ensure compatibility within the network topology.

**Topology Recommendations:**
- Equipment should be configured in a SAN topology that includes multiple switches (labeled A, B, and C) to ensure proper interoperability.
- Each switch should have matching firmware (e.g., Y for switch A, Z for switch C) to achieve seamless communication.

**Connectivity Considerations:**
- EMC recommends using compliant revisions and interlinked topologies for optimal performance.
- Ensure all switches, directors, and optics are compatible and specified for this configuration.

**Optics and Compatibility:**
- The implementation may involve both short-wave and long-wave optics.

For optimal performance, it's critical to maintain a consistent application revision across the switches in your environment. Ensure that the firmware versions are compatible, particularly when integrating switches from different manufacturers (e.g., IBM chassis with IBM Multiswitch (39Y9314)). 

The document emphasizes maintaining the highest application revision for compatibility across all switches involved in the topology, which includes switches A, B, and C. The interconnected switches must support the same firmware revisions to work effectively together.

### Inter-Switch Link (ISL) Guidance

When calculating hops across ISLs, consider the number of active ISLs connected to each switch. The expectation is to establish interoperability between lower-level switches and those with higher application revisions.

### Connectivity and Additional Considerations 

For a robust configuration, ensure the use of industry-standard switches, routers, and Network Interface Cards (NICs). The compatibility is also contingent on connecting up to four HBAs to products such as the AX150 and utilizing both IP and FC switch capabilities.

The recommended practice includes direct connections from the NIC to the switches, maintaining a distance of four arrays when possible. The document underscores the importance of manual configuration of initiators and authentication (such as CHAP) when integrating with EMC products, adopting Microsoft initiators where appropriate.

### End of Service and Specifications
