### Location

The placement of the cooking equipment should be strategically aligned along the intended path to ensure safety. Specifically, it must be positioned considering children’s accessibility and the risk of burns from hot surfaces. The cooking area should maintain sufficient clearance both above and at the back to prevent hazards, as outlined by CGA/AGA guidelines. The minimum clearance should be three inches to mitigate the risk of burns or fire. This clearance is particularly critical when overhead obstacles are present. Rather than using thin materials, thick protective covers like 28MSG sheet metal are preferable. 

Clearance specifications should be adhered to during operation, based on the design of the surrounding materials. This applies to the areas with lath and other structural supports as outlined in the Clearances Chart. The distance from the cooking surface to the overhead area is essential for operational safety. It's the responsibility of the user to comply with these clearance guidelines for optimal functioning.

When using electric cooktops, the heat settings (MAX and MIN) should be adjusted appropriately to achieve desired cooking temperatures. Attention should be given to safety measures, especially with children around during operation. 

### Heating Features

The radiant heater features thermal insulation to ensure efficient energy use. Users should turn off the heat when not in immediate use to prevent hazardous situations. Smooth-top cookers should have the heating elements controlled effectively, and cookware suited for these types of cooktops must not exceed specified dimensions to avoid overheating.

Cookware Selection

Choice of cookware is critical; heavy, thick-bottom pots distribute heat evenly, while thin cookware can cause food to burn. It's advisable to use pans that fit snugly on the heating surface. Care should be taken to monitor food at high temperatures to avoid burning, adjusting heat as necessary to reduce the risk of fire.

### Cleaning Procedures

Maintain the cooktop's clarity using appropriate cleaning agents for smooth, glass-like surfaces. Avoid harsh chemicals that may damage the finish. Use a dedicated cleaner-conditioner for regular upkeep, applying it while the surface is cool to ensure effective cleaning without scratching.

In instances of burned-on residue, a combination of gentle cleaning agents might be necessary, along with careful scrubbing techniques to avoid damaging the cooktop. 

### Griddle Usage

For optimal performance, adjustable cooktops allow users to set the necessary temperatures on both the front and back sections simultaneously, facilitating even cooking across heavy items like a griddle.
