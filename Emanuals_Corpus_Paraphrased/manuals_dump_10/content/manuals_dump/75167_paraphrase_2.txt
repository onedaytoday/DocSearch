The LW GN series combines traditional cooking with innovative research, focusing on operational versatility and efficiency. It supports a cook & chill method, tailored to meet the needs of various food preparations. The GN operating modes include convection cooking, allowing meat to be prepared without browning and gratin-style finishes through a half-power steam function. This steam feature enhances food cooking, reduces prep time, and optimizes temperature control.

Additional functionalities include a HOLD setting for maintaining the appropriate temperature for items like cakes, while electronically managed cooling and cleaning processes improve usability compared to earlier models. The inclusion of HACCP compliance allows for detailed tracking of cooking processes for food safety management.

Technical specifications include various convection and steaming modes, and a cooking chamber equipped with an integrated hose for efficient steam delivery. The construction is designed for durability and ease of cleaning, featuring a thermo-glazed finish and built-in safety measures. Accessibility is enhanced through front-mounted lighting and an IPX5 protection rating.

A range of accessories is available, including racks for chicken, frying baskets, automatic water softeners, aluminum baking trays, and additional cleaning and support options. Comprehensive support solutions include adjustable feet, HACCP integration kits, and various non-stick pan sizes, alongside equipment for maintaining optimal water filtration and efficiency in culinary processes.
