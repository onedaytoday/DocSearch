**Quick User Guide**

**Screen A Installation:**  
Begin by identifying the wall space for mounting the screen. Position it about one inch from the ceiling. Use the provided mounting anchors and screws, which can be found at the back of the screen and to the right. If alternative mounting methods are required, consult the additional instructions provided.

**Screen B Operation:**  
To operate the screen, use the included chains. Ensure the screen hangs straight, allowing it to retract smoothly into its housing. Be cautious not to exceed the specified width during operation. If resistance is encountered, apply gentle force to guide it back into the housing without disengaging the retracting mechanism.
