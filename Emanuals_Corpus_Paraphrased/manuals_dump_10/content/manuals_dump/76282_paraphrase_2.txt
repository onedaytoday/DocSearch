When integrating the AM Black, ensure that the mounting is adjusted to the specified height and securely fastened to the front of the plinth using the provided four countersunk screws (H). This configuration allows for proper clearance above the top. If necessary, further adjustments may be made to the dimensions (W and H) to optimize the overall positioning and security of the setup.
