### Vacuum Cleaner Owner’s Guide (Z2250 Series)

#### Important Information and Safety Precautions

**Service and Maintenance:**  
Ensure you have the right service information and locate the rating plate of your vacuum cleaner. Before attempting any service, turn off the vacuum and disconnect it from the electrical supply. This ensures safety against potential fire, electric shock, or injury.

**Electrical Connection:**  
Verify the voltage specified on the rating plate is compatible with your electrical supply. For permanent connections, use a 13A fuse (ASTA BS1362 or BSI standard), and ensure the cover is securely attached. Never operate the cleaner without the appropriate cover in place.

**Warning:**  
Keep the vacuum’s cord free of obstructions. Ensure it doesn’t come into contact with hot surfaces or sharp edges. Always turn off the vacuum when performing cleaning or maintenance tasks.

**Cable Connections:**  
The color-coded wires (Brown for live, Blue for neutral, Green/Yellow for earth) must be connected according to the appropriate electrical standards. Verify that all connections are secure and insulated.

**Cleaning Operations:**  
Before starting cleaning, ensure the vacuum head is elevated from the electrical supply. Avoid using the vacuum for purposes outside its intended use, such as with fresheners or polishes, to prevent damage.

**Service Checklist:**  
If the vacuum's performance diminishes, check for blockages or damaged components. For any technical issues, consult a professional service center or obtain authorized parts.

**Product Warranty:**  
Your vacuum is covered for defects in materials and workmanship for one year from the date of purchase. Service is provided free of charge if the vacuum has been used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Any unauthorized service or repair may void this warranty.

**User Assembly Instructions:**  
To assemble, ensure the ON/OFF switch is in the OFF position. Install the cover on the top and secure it with provided screws. Proper assembly of cords and accessories is essential for safe operation.

**Regular Maintenance:**  
Regularly check and clean components, including the dusting tool and upholstery attachments. Make sure the hose is clear of debris, and inspect for any wear or damage.

**Final Note:**  
For any service queries or issues with performance, consult the documentation or authorized service centers. Always refer to the specific maintenance guidelines provided for your vacuum model.

**Troubleshooting Guidelines**

**CAUTION:** Ensure the device is powered off before servicing.

**Issue:** Reduced suction when using the hose.  
**Cause:** Blockage or dirt in the hose.  
**Solution:** Clean the hose thoroughly and check for any obstructions. Make sure the hose is securely connected to both the back of the cleaner and the suction head.

If the suction power remains low, inspect the hose for wear and tear. Clear any clogs and ensure the hose is seated properly in the machine.

If necessary, adjust the height selector from a lower to a higher position to improve performance.

**Thermal Protection:** The device is equipped with a thermal thermostat to prevent overheating. If the unit overheats, it shuts off automatically. When this happens, turn off the power and allow the cleaner to cool down.

For any recycling concerns or information on proper disposal, contact your local waste management office or the place of purchase.
