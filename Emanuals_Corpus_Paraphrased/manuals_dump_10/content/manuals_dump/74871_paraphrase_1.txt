The assembly continually clears water from the trough, achieving a specific thickness before it is removed and the process is restarted. This cycle continues until the water level reaches the top of the trough. Cleanliness contributes to optimal operation, indicated by specific sounds during use. Users may notice variations in cube clarity due to batch differences or variations in thickness, referred to as ice bridge dimples. When retrieved from the mold, the cubes' thickness impacts factory performance; as thickness increases, so does efficiency.

To adjust cube thickness, utilize the UP and DOWN ARROWS on the interface. Select the desired thickness by pressing the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW as needed. Ensure to allow a few hours for the adjustments to take effect. It is crucial to select a suitable thickness based on the ice batch's needs.

Periodic cleaning is vital, ideally every three months, to maintain performance. Avoid using abrasive materials or cleaners not specifically designed for stainless steel, such as bleach-based products. For maintenance, refer to usage guidelines and avoid damaging the surface.

During troubleshooting, if the unit is malfunctioning, first verify normal operation standards. Should issues persist, contact the manufacturer for support, providing the relevant details to facilitate service. Safety precautions should be taken to prevent electrical hazards during maintenance.

For optimal conditions, ensure the surrounding environment remains within prescribed temperature limits, and verify that water supply connections are secure. Regular checks and maintenance will enhance longevity and performance.
