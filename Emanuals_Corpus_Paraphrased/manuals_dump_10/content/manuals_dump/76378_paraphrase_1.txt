If you’re washing different types of fabrics like COTTON at 95°C, COLD, or WHITE and COLOURED items, you have several options, including HYGIENE at 60°C, MIX at 40°C, JEANS at 60°C, COLD SYNTHETICS at 60°C, EASY IRON at 60°C, and DELICATES at 40°C. You can apply features such as reduction, rinse hold, night cycle, or prewash as necessary.

For delicate fabrics like VISCOSE at 40°C, COLD, or items that require HANDWASH, such as WOOL, LINGERIE, and SILK at 30°C COLD, the settings will support gentle cleaning actions. The machine provides a prewash and accommodates specific treatment options like RINSE HOLD and NIGHT CYCLE as well. 

When sorting laundry, separate items into categories: whites, colours, synthetics, and heavier fabrics like towels or tablecloths. Wash whites and colours separately at appropriate temperatures—40°C or 60°C, ensuring that new coloured items are treated so as not to bleed. Use recommended treatment options, particularly with stubborn stains.

When using additives like bleach, apply them selectively to whites and coloured textiles. If necessary, refer to recommended charts for guidance on load sizes to prevent overloading.

For proper maintenance, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the electricity supply during cleaning, and follow all operational instructions. Regularly check the hose for blockages or damage and make sure it is securely connected during operation.

In case of an emergency emptying procedure, ensure the machine has cooled down before handling the emptying hose. Follow indicated steps to drain the water safely.

If service indicators show issues such as E10, E20, E40, or EF0, check the hose connections and ensure they are free of obstructions. If the problem persists, consult the service guidelines for assistance.
