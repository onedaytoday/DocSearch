**INSTALLING THE COOKER HOOD**

To install the cooker hood, begin by securing the screws located at the top of the unit. These screws are included with the product. The effectiveness of the extraction system depends on whether the hood is ducted (for which you can purchase compatible ducting) or if it utilizes charcoal filters conforming to British or DIN 4102-B1 standards.

Ensure the charcoal filter is properly fitted according to the guidelines, as this will optimize extraction through the designated outlets. Connect the appropriate ducting to the top of the unit, using the recommended configuration to maintain system efficiency while minimizing noise.

If using ducting, it is critical to select the shortest and most direct route possible to enhance performance. Avoid tight bends in the ducting, as these can hinder airflow and reduce efficiency. If the unit is to be used in a continuously heated environment, ensure that the installation complies with insulation standards.

For chimneys, the assembly includes upper and lower chimney sections. To install the upper chimney, adjust it slightly to fit the outlet correctly, and secure it in place with the provided screws. The lower chimney requires a similar adjustment and securing action. 

For electrical connections, refer to the section titled ELECTRICAL CONNECTION for proper guidance on the setup and integration with heating appliances like boilers or heaters.
