### Setting the Clock at Power-Up

To set the clock when the appliance is powered on or when the power supply is interrupted, simply press the clock button to adjust the time displayed. Use the START or CANCEL buttons to navigate through control panel display modes. If the clock is inactive for a period, it will revert to cooking functions or timers. The temperature visual display will show the current cooking temperature, accompanied by an alert once the desired preheating temperature is reached, informing you that the oven is ready for cooking. Note that the lowest temperature displayed is 100°F.

### Oven Light

The oven includes theater-style lighting that can be adjusted to different brightness levels. The interior lights activate when the oven door is opened and turn off when it is closed. The intensity of the light can be adjusted via the OVEN LIGHT CONTROL. For safety, ensure that the lights are off when the oven is not in use.

### Setting the Kitchen Timer

To set the kitchen timer, press the TIMER button until the desired time is displayed. You can begin or cancel the countdown with the appropriate buttons. The timer will flash when it is active and will emit a repeated sound when the countdown concludes. 

### Locations of the Burners

The burner locations and their BTU ratings are specified for proper usage. Ensure each burner head fits correctly, and adjust them to achieve a steady, blue flame. Yellow or orange flames indicate improper adjustments, which should be corrected for safety. Clean each burner head periodically to maintain functionality.

### Surface Cooking Utensils

Use good-quality cookware that is stable and suitable for the heat output. Ensure that the cookware matches the food type and amount for effective heat distribution. Avoid using warped or curved pans, as they do not cook food evenly. 

### Turning Off Surface Controls

When using the surface burners, select the appropriate control settings according to the food being prepared. Ensure safety by avoiding the placement of flammable items near the cooking surface.

### Using the Griddle

When using the griddle, ensure even positioning over the heat source without any obstruction, allowing the food to cook evenly. Always use potholders to prevent burns, and avoid placing hot cookware on surfaces that cannot withstand high temperatures.

### Warmer Oven Operation

The warmer oven is designed to keep cooked food warm. It's best to cover food items while in the warm setting. Select the WARMER OVEN option, ensure the temperature is set appropriately (around 170°F), and press START. Cover food to retain moisture and heat.

### Baking Instructions 

For baking, preheat the oven to the desired temperature (between 170°F and 550°F) before placing food inside. Ensure the racks are positioned correctly for optimal airflow. Use the BAKE button and press START to initiate the preheat process, which will be indicated on the display. If cooking times extend, consider using the COOK TIME or END TIME features for automatic shut-off.

### Broiling Guidelines

For broiling, use high heat to achieve optimal cooking, primarily from 300°F to 550°F. Preheat the broiler and monitor food closely to prevent burning. Do not cover food or leave the oven unattended while broiling. 

### Convection Baking Techniques

For convection baking, preheat the oven and consider food adjustments based on size and type, as convection involves different heat distribution. Use the CONVECTION BAKE setting and adjust cooking times accordingly. 

These guidelines ensure effective, safe usage of your oven and enhance cooking results.

### BREAD PROOFING

This feature creates a warm environment (typically between 85°F to 100°F, ideally at 100°F) to activate the yeast in dough. 

**Tips:** Preheat for optimal results, ensuring the dough remains in a shallow container for consistent heating.

To set proofing at 100°F: Select UPPER OVEN, press BREAD PROOF, and then press START.

### PERFECT TURKEY

Designed specifically for cooking turkey, this function operates between 170°F to 550°F, commonly set to 325°F, and helps ensure the bird reaches an internal temperature of 180°F.

**Tips:** Thaw the turkey in advance and use a roasting pan that allows for grease collection.

To utilize this function: Select UPPER OVEN, press PERFECT TURKEY, and optionally use the PROBE feature for precise temperature monitoring.

### TEMPERATURE PROBE

This feature tests the internal temperature of food, ensuring it cooks thoroughly. 

**Important:** Use the probe with care; avoid touching hot surfaces and be sure to insert it correctly. 

To set the temperature probe: Select UPPER OVEN, choose COOK OPTIONS, and insert the probe before pressing START to monitor cooking.

### MULTI STAGE

This function allows for a sequence of cooking methods, featuring multiple stages of convection baking, roasting, and proofing. 

To start: Select UPPER OVEN, press MULTI STAGE, follow prompts for the specific cooking sequence, and then press START.

If adjustments are needed, use the CANCEL function to exit or modify settings.
