### Tips for Using Your Traditional Oven

**Preheating and Cooking:**
- Ensure you preheat your oven as specified. This is crucial for a successful cooking process. 
- For cakes, use a toothpick to check readiness; when it comes out clean, the cake is done.
- Meat should be cooked thoroughly to avoid toughness. High temperatures should be monitored to ensure the meat cooks evenly without drying out.
- When roasting, fat should be sufficiently rendered; otherwise, it can lead to poor texture.
- Cooking times should be adjusted based on the thickness and type of meat, as well as for seafood.

**Cooking Guidelines:**
- Begin cooking at a high temperature, then lower it as the cooking progresses. This helps achieve a uniformly cooked product, especially for white meats and fish.
- Always brush meat lightly with oil to prevent burning and ensure even cooking throughout.
- Regularly refer to cooking time tables for specific items.

### Maintenance

**Cleaning:**
- Clean spills and splashes promptly using a soft cloth to maintain the oven’s finish.
- Use non-abrasive cleaners and avoid rough cloths that might scratch surfaces. Clean the plates only when cooled.
- Remove and clean the heat cover while ensuring it’s disconnected from power.

**Catalytic Cleaning:**
- For catalytic sides, run the oven empty at 220°C for a few hours to help degrade grease splashes. Regular use of this cleaning feature can prevent buildup.
