**Technical Overview of Chilling Systems for Cooked Food**

The 20GN2/1 chilling system effectively reduces the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, minimizing bacterial growth, and maintaining food safety until it can be stored at -18°C. This chilled food can be held at the required temperature without compromising shelf life. The system offers various operational modes, including soft chilling and shock chilling, allowing for precise temperature control at +3°C or -18°C, in compliance with NF and UK regulations. The design includes built-in UV features as an optional accessory, facilitating defrosting and ensuring optimal meat preservation.

The control panel provides a countdown timer and service alerts, while performance data is continuously recorded, aiding in HACCP compliance. The system is designed to chill food from +90°C to +3°C within four hours, accommodating various food types and chilling capacities.

**Construction and Insulation**

The unit features high-density polyurethane insulation, is HCFC-free, and meets ISO standards, ensuring durability and efficiency. The exterior is constructed with rounded corners and is protected to IP20 standards, facilitating easy cleaning.
