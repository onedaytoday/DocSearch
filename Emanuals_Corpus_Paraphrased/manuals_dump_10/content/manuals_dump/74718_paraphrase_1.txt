## Important Safety Instructions
For your safety and the proper functioning of the appliance, follow these instructions closely. This appliance is heavy; handle with care when moving it. Ensure that the power supply is dependable and that the appliance is not exposed to heat sources. Always maintain adequate space at the back as per the guidelines. Please allow the appliance several hours to stabilize after turning it on. 

Be cautious of compatibility with existing equipment. If you experience any malfunctions or ignition issues, always contact authorized technicians for assistance. Regular checks are essential to prevent suffocation hazards, especially for children. Never expose the appliance to direct sunlight or near heat sources like boilers. 

Proper cleanliness is crucial to prevent frost/ freezer burns, especially from improper food storage. Follow the manufacturer’s recommended guidelines for maintaining the appliance and avoid attempting repairs without proper authorization, as this could pose serious risks.

## Appliance Description
### Food and Fresh Food Compartments
#### Operation
The thermostat is used to control the appliance’s cooling ability. The yellow light indicates activation when set to -16°C, while switching it off will deactivate the cooling system. The red warning light indicates warmer temperatures, advising you to check the internal temperature.

To quickly freeze fresh food, place it in the top section, ensuring it doesn't block airflow. Once the food is fully frozen, the function can be manually turned off after a specific duration is reached.

Always maintain food organization to allow for proper air circulation. Avoid overloading the compartments, and ensure the doors are closed properly to maximize efficiency.

## Health and Safety Guidelines
Ensure proper cooling and thawing of food to prevent contamination. Food should be uncovered only briefly when cooling. To thaw, allow food to sit at room temperature instead of placing it directly in warm conditions. 

Maintain cleanliness by regularly washing surfaces and utensils. Cooking instructions are especially important for safety, and food should be thoroughly cooked before consumption to avoid illness.  

---

## Defrosting
Frost may accumulate inside the appliance, requiring timely defrosting when it reaches substantial thickness. To defrost, switch off the unit, and place layers of newspaper around the food for insulation. Once complete, reset the thermostat to the desired cooling setting.

---

## Maintenance and Cleaning
Disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning agents; avoid harsh detergents or abrasive materials that may damage surfaces. Perform routine maintenance, including cleaning the condenser, at least annually.

## Troubleshooting
If the appliance is not performing correctly, check for potential installation errors or user-related issues. After addressing any visible problems, if the appliance fails to operate, consult an authorized service provider for repairs. Keep in mind that temperature settings need to be appropriate for efficient operation.

**Installation**  
Position the unit for optimal efficiency in environments where the temperature remains below 10°C (50°F) or above 32°C (90°F), protecting it from heat and direct sunlight. Ensure there is adequate space for air circulation around the rear and top of the appliance. Allow clearance at the top and sides to facilitate proper airflow. 

When manipulating the NP006 D200, avoid obstructions at the back. To safely adjust:

1. Carefully tilt the unit backward while ensuring a clearance of a few inches from the surface.
2. Detach the top section by unscrewing it.
3. Remove the base foot if necessary to allow for access.
4. Use a tool to unscrew any screws as needed, taking care not to damage the unit.
