**Stop/Check-Valve Information**
The operational indicators should align with the flow arrows. For manual closure, ensure the valve is seated slightly open to allow flow, contrasting with the fully closed position allowing no flow. 

**Installation Notes**
Installation should follow applicable retrofitting guidelines. Ensure proper assembly from the casting's top, accommodating specifications for P28 and P128 models, which must remain factory-sealed during operations. 

**WARNING:** The P28 and P128 have built-in relays for system protection, aiding in monitoring crankcase conditions. If abnormal readings occur, the relay will enable shutdown procedures as part of safety features. Adhere to specified instructions to ensure safe operation.

**Caution:** Be mindful of the mounting requirements and the need for an effective oil level within the crankcase. Avoid potential hazards by ensuring that all wiring is compliant with National Electrical Code standards.

**Electrical Specifications**
When wiring the P28 or P128, verify compatibility with specified voltages (208V, 240V, etc.) to ensure correct relay functioning. The crankcase heater specifications should also align with the designated operating environment.

**Relay Testing Procedures**
It is critical to regularly test the relay, especially after any installation or maintenance work. Ensure that all systems are functioning correctly to prevent operational failures.

For any questions regarding installation or specifications, consult the Johnson Inc. Application Information Table for further guidance. This ensures compliance with all performance standards and regulatory requirements.

- Follow assembly instructions carefully, paying attention to all components such as the arms and their connections.

**Safety Valve (Internal Relief)**
- In case of a malfunction, ensure to access the safety valve cover by loosening the screws. Valve functionality should be maintained for pressures of PSIG 300F (150C). Proper thread lubrication during reassembly is crucial.

**Oil Pressure Adjustment Assembly**
- Located at the front housing, the oil pressure adjustment assembly comprises a machined seat and an adjustment screw. Use a screwdriver to adjust the bypass amount as needed.
- After cleaning and reassembly, ensure the washers are fitted correctly, and tighten the screws uniformly.

**Tri-Micro Oil Filter Maintenance**
- Begin by removing the screws of the front cover. Make sure to clean all components thoroughly before reassembling.
- Ensure the filter is free from contaminants and securely seated before tightening down the screws.

**Oil Pump Assembly**
- When servicing the oil pump assembly, disconnect all necessary components, and carefully remove screws from the housing. Clean all mating surfaces and ensure correct assembly to prevent leaks.
- Follow specifications for fitting and sealing to ensure the assembly is operational.

**Preparation for Internal Servicing**
- Internally access the machine by removing the cover and disconnecting electrical connections. Inspect the crankcase and cover for any abnormalities before reassembly.
- Apply grease during reinstallation to facilitate smooth functioning.

**Crankshaft Seal Maintenance**
- Check the crankshaft for wear, and ensure seals are in good condition to prevent leaks. Clean the bearings and components thoroughly prior to reassembly.
- Ensure the assembly fits snugly, with no excessive force needed to insert components.

**Connecting Rods and Pistons**
- Prior to assembly, ensure all parts, including connecting rods and bearings, have been cleaned properly. Maintain proper orientation of connecting parts during assembly.
- Use a piston ring compressing tool to aid reassembly. Ensure all components align appropriately to prevent mechanical failure.

**Caution**
- Observe all safety measures during inspection and servicing. If any bearing shows wear, it must be replaced immediately to prevent further damage to the system.
- Maintain a clean work environment throughout the service process and ensure all components are reassembled in their specified order.

This condensed guide provides technical steps for servicing Vilter's 450XL Compressors, emphasizing safety and proper maintenance to optimize performance and longevity.

### B. Reassembly

To connect the components, refer to the Piston Ring Dimensions Table for appropriate measurements and tolerances for compression and oil rings. Ensure that the rings are oriented correctly during the reassembly process. Align all components properly, securing them with locking mechanisms as necessary.

**Note:** Although the crankshaft may be reused, inspect each component carefully before reassembly. Itâ€™s essential to follow service instructions closely to ensure smooth operation.

When extracting the assembly from the crankcase, caution is advised to prevent damage to the suction chamber and crankshaft.

Ensure that any notches on the components align correctly, particularly when oriented at the assemblyâ€™s top. Use a specific tool for cylinder liner assembly and removal as indicated in the provided figures.

### XIV. Crankshaft

For crankshaft service, isolate the component from the front housing, ensuring to catch any debris during disassembly. Remove screws carefully and free the crankshaft from the housing. The process may differ for various models, so consult the specific guidelines for the 458XL or 4516XL models.

Upon disassembly, verify the proper orientation of the crankshaft and its bearings. If necessary, apply cleaning agents to remove any deposits from the housing.

**February VILTER MANUFACTURING CORPORATION SECTION 105-R PAGE March VMC COMPRESSORS REPLACEMENT PARTS ORDERING INSTRUCTIONS**

To properly place orders, ensure to document the model, as well as any applicable specifications (e.g., A, AH, R22S, R12H). This determines if the unit is built for RPM or standard deployment. The stock card, found directly below the crankcase or suction cover, is crucial for part selection. In the event of discrepancies regarding parts or costs, adhere to specified guidelines for routing as parts are shipped FOB from the factory. For purchases made outside the corporation, include details on the supplier and purchase date.
