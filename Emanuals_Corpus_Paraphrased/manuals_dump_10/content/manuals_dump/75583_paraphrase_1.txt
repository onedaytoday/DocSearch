The refrigeration units operate between -2°C and +8°C and feature robust construction with thickness-enhancing built-in coolers. They incorporate pre-charged cooling systems, utilizing advanced techniques for assembly and high-performance polyurethane insulation. These units are CFC and HCFC free, designed with rounded internal corners to optimize airflow. The fast-fit design facilitates installation, ensuring airtight sealing with high-grade PVC components. They are compatible with R404A refrigerant and can function effectively in ambient temperatures up to +43°C.

Defrosting is managed through heated methods, minimizing frost buildup while maintaining the efficiency of internal lighting rated at IP54. Each unit is equipped with an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting control, and a thermostat for precise operation. The right-hinged doors feature smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring airtight closure and optimal thermal insulation, which contributes to reduced operating costs and compliance with HACCP standards.
