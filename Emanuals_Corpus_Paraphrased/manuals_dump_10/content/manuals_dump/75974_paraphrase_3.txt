### ICE AND WATER DISPENSER FEATURES

The dispenser offers both cubed and crushed ice options. To select your preferred ice type, press the corresponding button. Make sure to connect the unit to a reliable water supply for optimal functionality. It is recommended to flush the system first to eliminate any chemicals or potential malfunctions.

The water supply must be turned on to ensure proper operation, which can take several hours. The On/Off switch can be pressed to activate the system. If necessary, manual operation may be required to clear any obstructions or ice buildup. Always keep the ice compartment empty and ensure the On/Off switch is activated.

For maintenance, routinely clean the dispenser, turn the On/Off switch off, and use a diluted cleaner to wipe down surfaces. Ensure thorough rinsing is performed before reactivating the system. Avoid using scouring pads or abrasive cleaners to prevent damage.

#### PureSource™ Ice and Water Note

If your unit is equipped with PureSource™, refer to the relevant instructions for proper setup. The water supply should be activated from the factory. Ensure that connections are secure and that you have the right water line setup as per the guidelines provided. 

#### FOOD STORAGE IDEAS

Store fresh food within temperatures of 32°F to 40°F while avoiding overcrowding the shelves, as this can hinder airflow and cooling efficiency. Ensure meats are well-wrapped to prevent cross-contamination. Position items to allow for proper circulation, thus minimizing freezer burn and maximizing freshness.
