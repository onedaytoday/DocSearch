#### Operation:
This appliance is equipped with features like FAST CHILL and FAST FREEZE. During initial setup, allow a few hours for optimal cooling and freezing performance. The appliance should not be overloaded to avoid poor cooling.

#### Electrical Safety:
**WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED.** The appliance should be connected to a suitable power supply as specified on the rating label. This includes following proper wire color coding for electrical connections: 
- Earth: Green/Yellow 
- Neutral: Blue 
- Live: Brown

Ensure that the appliance is turned off and unplugged during maintenance or cleaning.

### Maintenance and Cleaning:
Regularly clean the interior and exterior to avoid buildup. For any repairs or servicing, always consult a qualified technician. 

#### Food Storage:
Keep food properly packaged to prevent frost or freezer burn. Ice cube trays and bottle racks should be arranged to facilitate air circulation.

### Control Panel:

### Final Setup:
Upon initial startup, press the ON/OFF button, and monitor the control panel for status lights. Adjust temperature settings as appropriate for your needs, ensuring food is stored at safe temperatures.

For complete safety and efficiency, adhere to all provided operational guidelines.

### Fast Chill/Fast Freeze Functions 

**Fast Chill:**  
The FAST CHILL function rapidly cools food to a pre-set temperature of +2°C. To activate, press the recessed FAST CHILL/-FREEZE button until the "IC" indicator blinks, indicating the cooling process is starting. The FAST CHILL function will operate for several hours and will automatically return to its previous temperature setting afterward. If needed, you can also disable the FAST CHILL function manually.

**Fast Freeze:**  
The FAST FREEZE function quickly preserves fresh food and safeguards against spoilage. To engage it, press the same FAST CHILL/-FREEZE button until a yellow light indicates activation. It runs for a specific timeframe, automatically adjusting to handle the volume of food being frozen. This function can only be turned on manually. 

To turn off either function, press and hold the ON/OFF button for several seconds until a countdown appears, indicating the appliance will power down. 

**Stand-by Mode:**  
The stand-by mode maintains a temperature of +15°C to prevent unintentional spoilage or mold growth, especially when the door is left slightly ajar. To exit stand-by mode, rotate the control knob anticlockwise until it reaches +10°C. 

### Notifications and Warnings  
The appliance features visual and acoustic alerts for temperature irregularities. If the internal temperature exceeds 5°C or if food is at risk of thawing, the warning light will flash along with a sound. When the actual temperature meets the selected settings, alerts cease. 

**Thaw Warning:**  
If the appliance detects temporary thawing, a warning will indicate that food may be compromised. If temperatures fall below -4°C during thawing, alerts will deactivate automatically.

**Malfunctions:**  
In the event of a technical failure, error codes (F1 through F7) will be displayed, with accompanying sounds. These problems will require service technician intervention.

### Food Storage Guidelines  
To optimize fresh food storage, adjust shelves to suitable heights, ensuring taller items fit properly. Bottles should be stored horizontally, and delicate foods should be placed strategically to prevent damage. 

**Recommended Temperatures:**  
Maintain food at or below -18°C and consult the Food Standards Agency for recommended storage times for various food types. 

**Defrosting:**  
Defrost food based on its type, ensuring proper hygiene and health standards. Automatic defrosting capabilities are included, but users must monitor frost levels, cleaning as necessary.

### Cleaning and Maintenance  
Before cleaning the appliance, unplug it. Only use mild cleaners, avoiding harsh chemicals. The LED light can be maintained by ensuring the fixture is securely attached and functioning.

For ongoing operational issues or persistent warnings, contact the AEG Service team. Regularly review and maintain the appliance to ensure efficient performance.

**Frost Management and Technical Specifications**

In the event of a frost issue with the AEG appliance, it is important to address sounds indicative of a malfunction or breakdown. If the appliance is airtight, ensure proper heating methods are applied to facilitate function. The heater's design allows for efficient thermal management, transferring warmth from the food or its surroundings. 

Heat dissipation occurs through a closed system, with cooling managed directly by the appliance’s built-in rear mechanisms. This system optimally releases heat to the surrounding environment during its cycle. 

The appliance adheres to relevant safety regulations for household usage, including German legislation (GSG, VBG) and standards set by the VDE, in alignment with EU directives (73/23/EWG, 89/336/EWG, including 92/31/EWG). 

**Warranty Information**

AEG provides support to the first purchaser for a defined period post-purchase, covering workmanship and material defects. Warranty claims can be made for any unauthorized modifications or installation issues. This service includes repair or replacement, and any replaced parts will remain the property of AEG. If ownership changes or if the appliance is moved to another country, warranty conditions may alter depending on regulations in that region. 

For any service inquiries or technical assistance, customers are encouraged to contact AEG Service Force, ensuring to have information such as the purchase number (PNC) and serial number (S-No.) readily available.
