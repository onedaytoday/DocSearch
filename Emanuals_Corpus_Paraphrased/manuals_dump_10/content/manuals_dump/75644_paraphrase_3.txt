**Instructions Regarding Functionality and Safety Precautions**

Continuous operation of the unit is essential. The temperature settings may be too low, which could indicate frost formation affecting food items. Ensure adequate air circulation by allowing the appliance to warm slightly if frost accumulates. Refer to the "Starting and Regulation" section for details.

Avoid unnecessary adjustments to the thermostat. Temporarily increase the temperature as outlined in the "Location" section. Consult the "Light" section for guidance on illumination issues. Adhere to the cleaning and maintenance instructions provided.

**Warning**: Be cautious of electrical shocks! Always turn off the light switch and disconnect from the power source before proceeding. To address lighting issues, turn down the thermostat, then remove the light cover by pressing it backward as demonstrated, and secure with the screw afterward. If you hear clicking sounds from the switches or experience a humming noise during operation or when the appliance is powered down, these could signify normal operational sounds or potential issues.

**Regulatory Compliance**: This household appliance complies with relevant legislation, specifically adhering to safety standards set by the German Equipment and Product Safety Act (GSG), regulations under the Trade Association (VBG), and guidelines from the Association for Electrical, Electronic & Information Technologies (VDE). Additionally, it meets the requirements of EU directives 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG (including 92/31/EWG) regarding electromagnetic compatibility.

**Technical Overview**: The cooling mechanism is designed to maintain a temperature differential, allowing heat to be expelled from the interior to the external environment. The heat is managed through a built-in and rear-mounted system that ensures effective thermal regulation. The unit typically emits heat in the process of cooling, which is distributed into the surrounding area.
