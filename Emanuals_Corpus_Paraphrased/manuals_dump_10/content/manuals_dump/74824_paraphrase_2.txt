### TURBO/FROSTMATIC Button Overview

The TURBO/FROSTMATIC function enhances the cooling of fresh food items while safeguarding previously stored goods. To activate this function, press the TURBO/FROSTMATIC button, which will illuminate a light indicating the process has started. This feature will cool the compartment to the desired temperature efficiently.

The TURBO/FROSTMATIC function can be activated manually, and it remains operational for a set duration. The alert light will signal when the function is in use. When the temperature reaches a specified level, the function will automatically deactivate. If required, you can also manually turn off the TURBO/FROSTMATIC function at any time.

The appliance emits an acoustic warning to indicate if the temperature rises above the set point or if food items have been placed in the unit for cooling. It will also sound an alarm if the temperature of the food surpasses the threshold and will stop once the desired cooling level is achieved.

### Operational Guidelines

Ensure that the appliance is level and properly installed according to the user's manual. The unit should be set to a temperature of -18°C or colder for optimal food preservation. An ON/OFF button allows you to activate or deactivate the unit, confirmed by audible and visual signals.

During operation, if adjustments are needed, you can switch between cooling levels using designated buttons for warmer or colder settings. Be cautious not to exceed the maximum temperature specifications for food storage.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Before cleaning, always disconnect the appliance from the power supply. Use appropriate cleaning products that are safe for use on appliances. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners as they may damage the surface.

### Troubleshooting

For persistent issues, contact a qualified service technician for further assistance. Regular maintenance and adherence to operational guidelines help ensure the longevity and efficiency of your appliance.
