The system incorporates cold storage functionalities, featuring coolers that operate within a temperature range of -2/+8°C. The units are available in varying thicknesses and can include built-in or external systems. They are designed with pre-charged cooling mechanisms and require installation expertise for assembly. 

The coolers utilize advanced injection technologies to enhance performance and maintain high quality, employing pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free from CFCs and HCFCs. The units are constructed with rounded corners and a fast-fit feature for easier setup. They are designed to be airtight and compatible with both PVC and other materials. The systems can operate in high and low ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) and utilize refrigerant R404A.

For optimal performance, the units incorporate a heated defrosting system to minimize frost buildup, alongside internal lighting (rated IP54). Control features include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a functioning thermostat. The right-hinged doors are equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring airtight operation and high insulation to minimize energy consumption.

This system complies with HACCP standards and is equipped for various shelving accessories:

- **Technical Specifications**: Available in multiple voltage phases with detailed height and power ratings.
- **Accessories**: Options such as aluminum shelving and poly tiers compatible with different cold room dimensions, door microswitches, graphic temperature recorders, HACCP advanced connection kits, plastic curtains for 65 cm door clearances, and various printing solutions for temperature documentation are available.
