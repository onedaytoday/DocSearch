### Technical Instructions for Appliance Setup and Maintenance

#### Appliance Connection and Power Supply
Ensure that the appliance is connected to an electrical supply that meets the specified ratings. If using a moulded-on plug, it must comply with BS1362 and have ASTA certification. For powering the appliance, it is crucial that the outlet is appropriately rated and secure. 

Authorized fittings should be used, particularly for fused outlets. The following wiring color codes should be adhered to:

- **Brown:** Live
- **Blue:** Neutral
- **Green/Yellow:** Earth

The term "DOUBLE POLE" indicates that the appliance is connected to both the live and neutral sides of the electrical supply.

#### Compliance with Regulations
The installation must conform to national and local building regulations. This is especially important for appliances that produce combustion, such as room heaters and fireplaces. Appropriate authorization may be required before installation.

#### Ventilation and Performance
Ensure that outlets are unobstructed, as this will optimize appliance performance. Incorrectly routing exhaust can lead to reduced efficiency and increased risk of fire. If using ducted charcoal systems, follow the specific instructions provided for the appliance to ensure safe and effective operation.

#### Cleaning and Maintenance
Routine cleaning is essential for maintaining the applianceâ€™s performance. Clean the internal components as needed, preferably using grease-cleaning agents, and ensure all removable parts can be safely washed. Replace the charcoal filter at least every few months, depending on usage.

#### Light Function and Safety
If the light function ceases, check that the bulb is correctly installed and use a replacement with the correct specifications. Warning: Always turn off the appliance before cleaning and follow the recommended practices for fire safety, including ensuring that any grease is properly handled to avoid combustion hazards.
