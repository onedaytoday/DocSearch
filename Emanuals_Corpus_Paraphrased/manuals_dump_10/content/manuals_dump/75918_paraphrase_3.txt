### Operating Instructions

**Controls**  
The operational functions are activated via the following switches:
- Supply Switch (D)
- Thermostat (C)
- Lighting Control (F)

Ensure that the thermostat is set appropriately for either V or LP operation. Switch (G) allows you to check the indicator light.

### Starting the Refrigerator

To initiate operation:
1. Confirm the LP supply bottle is secure.
2. Activate the supply switch (D) and set the thermostat (E) to the highest setting initially.
3. Expect the indicator light to flash, indicating power. 
4. Once operational, adjust accordingly.

To stop operation, set the thermostat to off and deactivate the supply switch.

### Winter Operation

Use the appropriate winter covers for temperatures below 10°C to maintain efficiency during colder months.

### Regulating the Temperature

Allow several hours for the refrigerator to reach operating temperature. Adjust the thermostat as needed for optimal cooling performance.

### Travel Catch

Ensure the travel catch is properly engaged before travel to prevent door issues during transit.

### Food Storage

Store food with care, allowing for cooling. Seal items to avoid spoilage and ensure proper temperature regulation.

### Ice Making

To produce ice, ensure the temperature is sufficient for freezing. Adjust shelves as necessary to facilitate proper airflow.

### Defrosting

Regularly check for frost buildup and defrost when necessary to maintain efficiency. Follow proper procedures to avoid food spoilage.

### Cleaning the Refrigerator

To clean, use a damp cloth with bicarbonate soda. Avoid abrasive materials that may damage surfaces.

### Turning Off the Refrigerator

Power down by switching off the supply and emptying the unit as needed for prolonged periods.

### Troubleshooting  
If the refrigerator fails to operate, check:
- Proper supply connections
- Empty gas bottles
- Correct thermostat settings

For unresolved issues, consult a qualified service technician.

### Maintenance

Regular service should be conducted by authorized personnel, adhering to DVGW G607 standards for safe operation.

### Guarantee and Service

For service needs, refer to the provided documentation or local service directories.

### Technical Data

Refer to the specific model’s height, cooling capacity, and installation requirements.

### Installation Instructions

**Repositioning the Hinges**  
Follow the prescribed steps for adjusting hinges, ensuring proper alignment.

**Door Panel**  
Installation can be adjusted based on specific dimensions and needs.

Ensure all modifications are securely reassembled to maintain functionality and safety.

### Installation Instructions for Built-In Units

**Heat Management**  
The design of the unit minimizes radiated heat from the cooker, eliminating the need for a heat shield and improving thermal performance. For optimal results, the unit should be installed in vehicles oriented towards the south, where it can effectively manage heat and combustion byproducts. Covering the vehicle's vents may hinder cooling efficiency and overall functionality.

**Technical Specifications**  
Refer to the provided technical data for installation details. Ensure that any fasteners used are securely attached to withstand vehicle movement. If installation space is tight, the unit may require adjustments or insulation (e.g., PU foam) to protect against heat exposure.

**Ventilation**  
Ventilation is crucial, particularly under high temperatures. Air must flow freely through the unit and into the recess. Ideally, this should maintain a temperature of at least the specified Celsius value. The unit is designed for straightforward inspection and maintenance without removing it from the recess. Ensure the outer areas are protected from debris and sealed during colder seasons.

**Gas Connection**  
For LP gas operation, verify that the gas supply is at the correct pressure, checking the reducing valve on the LP gas container. Preferably, utilize a supply line suitable for continuously operating bottled gas connections. Avoid using push-on connections. The gas should be connected to the standard threaded coupling, ensuring a secure attachment to the LPG outlet.

**Electrical Connection**  
All wiring must adhere to current I.E.E. regulations, including using appropriate outlets and coupling as per BS4343/CEE17 standards. Ensure that the system is properly earthed and fused. The color coding for wiring is as follows:  
- Green-and-yellow: Earth  
- Blue: Neutral  
- Brown: Live  

Connect the wires to their respective terminals accordingly. It is critical to ensure that this appliance is earthed, especially in the UK, where voltage ratings should align with specifications on the appliance plate.

**Installation and Operation**  
For satisfactory operation, maintain a direct connection from the battery to the supply, with a relay to cut off power when the vehicle is off. The system layout, including switches and thermostats, should be configured as shown in the diagrams provided. All connections must be made securely to ensure reliable operation.
