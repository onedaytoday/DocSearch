Let me know if you need further adjustments or clarifications!

To begin cooking, activate the device by turning the switch, which will display the cooking function on the LCD. The function will become available within seconds and will automatically turn off after a set period. Choose the appropriate function for models EDEE63CS, EUEE63CS, and EUEE63CK. The LCD will indicate which cavity is active, allowing you to see the cooking process clearly.

Select the desired cooking function using the front cover controls. Press the function button to activate it; if another button is pressed within a few seconds, the system will register the selection and begin heating, which ranges from 30°C to 250°C. Once the selected temperature is reached, the. heating indicator will activate; the system will emit an audible cue when heating is complete.

Preheating is advised to ensure efficient cooking. During this phase, the device generates heat from its surroundings, enabling quicker cooking once the desired temperature is achieved. To switch the cavity off, press the upper/lower switch. If the cavity remains active for a period, the LCD will display the status, and both the cavity light and LCD will turn off automatically.

For effective cooking management, select the function and press the cook button as many times as needed, allowing for precise cooking times. The system also features a clock and timer functionality to assist with timing. The DELAY SET light will illuminate when an asynchronous cooking time is set. Upon activation, the current cooking function will initiate within a specified period, displaying the cooking status.

Be mindful that the system will turn off after a cooking period to ensure food safety. The timer provides audible reminders throughout the cooking process. If adjustments are needed, utilize the clock/timer buttons to ensure efficient operation.

To enable child lock functionality, press the designated button, which will display "LOCKED" to confirm activation. Releasing buttons will clear this mode. 

The device also involves a cooling mechanism to prevent overheating. If the internal temperature reaches excessive levels, the system will automatically cool down after cooking. 

For specific cooking temperatures and suggestions for varying types of food, follow the guidelines provided. Cooking times and temperatures vary depending on the thickness of the food items being prepared. Ensure adequate spacing among products to avoid interference with heat distribution.

Lastly, consult the manual for detailed instructions on cooking techniques, serving suggestions, and special precautions to enhance culinary outcomes.

The text provides guidelines for cleaning the EPEE63CS and EPEE63CK models, particularly focusing on the performance and maintenance of the top light and catalytic cleaning features. Users should avoid using harsh or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage surfaces or cause scratching. 

For effective cleaning, follow the specified procedures, such as maintaining the glass surfaces to withstand temperature changes without shattering. It’s crucial to clean the appliance promptly after use using appropriate cloth materials to prevent grease accumulation. 

The catalytic cleaning function operates at high temperatures (around 180°C to 250°C) to break down food residues; it is recommended to allow the appliance to cool down before cleaning with a cloth. Cleaning schedules should be kept, and the appliance should be disconnected from power when performing maintenance tasks to avoid electric shock. 

When using the self-cleaning function, the internal cavity reaches approximately 500°C to eliminate grease. After self-cleaning, users should allow adequate cool-down time before handling. 

For optimal performance, carefully organize cookware and avoid overcrowding, ensuring a consistent heat distribution. If issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting guide or contact customer service for assistance. Always consult operational instructions for specific operational tips and care.
