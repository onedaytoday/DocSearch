# Operating and Installation Manual for Electrolux Refrigerators Model RM 123E and RM 122F

## Important User Information
It is essential to keep this instruction manual for future reference. If the appliance is transferred to a new owner, ensure that this manual accompanies it, including information about its operation and maintenance. Users must follow all guidelines for safe functioning, including restricting access to children. Repairs should only be conducted by authorized service personnel, and the appliance should be operated strictly according to the specifications outlined. Users must adhere to guidelines regarding food safety and heat exposure.

### Safety Reminder
Avoid using sharp tools for frost removal; only defrost as per the guidelines. The appliance must be installed upright for a minimum of 24 hours before operation to ensure proper functionality. Allow icing to thaw naturally during defrosting. For repairs and maintenance, refer to the service manual and follow the manufacturer's instructions. Unauthorized repairs may lead to serious malfunction.

## General Guidelines for Plug Installation
Ensure the plug is fitted correctly, with care taken to secure the outer sheath and insulation around the conductors.

## Installation Instructions
### Introduction
Carefully follow this installation guide to ensure optimal performance. Maintain clearances as outlined to prevent any obstructions to heat dissipation, which is vital for effective cooling. The unit operates efficiently within ambient temperatures ranging from 2°C (36°F) to 35°C (95°F). It is advisable to consult a professional installer to comply with local building regulations.

### Placement
The appliance must be located in an area that allows adequate air circulation around the cooling components. Proper ventilation is necessary for performance efficiency, so do not obstruct the vents. Ensure the refrigerator is leveled when stationary for optimal cooling; improper leveling can affect ice tray functionality.

### Door Hinge Adjustment
If necessary, change the door hinge to the opposite side. This requires gently removing the assembly, unscrewing the hinges, and relocating them as per the instructions.

### Outer Door Panel Change
If the outer door panel needs replacement or color adjustment, ensure to detach it correctly and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for reinstallation.

### Dimensions and Built-in Installation
When building the appliance into cabinetry, consider the specified dimensions and ensure sufficient space for cooling air circulation. The recommended height and width for installation must be maintained to ensure compatibility and efficient operation.

### Ventilation Requirements
Proper airflow around the appliance is critical. Ensure that there is no obstruction, and pay attention to vent placement to minimize heat buildup. Install protective shielding as necessary.

### Flue Arrangement
Follow the guidelines for flue installation, ensuring it is appropriately positioned for optimal cooling performance. Any misalignment can cause operational inefficiencies.

## Electrical Installation
For models RM123, the cooling system features heaters rated at 75W, operating on 230V electricity. Ensure all electrical connections are compliant with IEE regulations and securely grounded. The 12V supply should connect directly to the vehicle’s battery and remain operational while the vehicle is hitched. When unhitched, the connection should switch off to prevent battery drainage.

In summary, adhere strictly to all installation and operation guidelines to ensure safety and maintain appliance performance.

**Electrical Connection and Requirements**

Ensure the appliance is connected to a properly grounded 230V electrical supply, with the outlet conveniently accessible. In the UK, use standard electrical plugs with color-coded wiring: **Green-and-yellow** for Earth, **Blue** for Neutral, and **Brown** for Live. The Green-and-yellow wire must be connected to the earth terminal, the Blue wire to the neutral terminal, and the Brown wire to the live terminal. 

**Caution:** Ensure that this appliance is earthed to comply with UK regulations. For other countries, ensure the supply conforms to local standards, rated appropriately between 12V and 12V. For heating purposes, connect the 12V supply to the corresponding terminals on the appliance's back while allowing enough space for servicing. The connecting wire should maintain suitable cross-sectional dimensions for efficient current flow.

To achieve proper cooling performance, ensure that the 12V supply is directly connected to the vehicle’s battery or an existing source to prevent overheating. All electrical connections should be weatherproof and securely maintained to avoid exposure to moisture. 

**Gas Supply Installation**

The gas supply should preferably utilize a continuously operating bottled supply, with a securely fitted and threaded connection. All gas fittings must comply with British standards (B.S.P). Connections should be easily accessible for servicing.

**Operational Guidelines**

For optimal performance, follow the instructions provided. Ensure adequate airflow, allowing for cooling fluid circulation. If experiencing reduced cooling efficiency, it may result from impeded airflow or improper positioning.

Perform checks when the appliance is stationary, ensuring that it remains upright. If the supply disconnects, re-establish power without delay. In case of frost accumulation, temporarily switch off to allow the ice tray to thaw.

**Starting the Refrigerator**

When starting the refrigerator, ensure that the gas supply is operational. Utilize a suitable lighter for ignition and follow the lighting procedure closely, observing safety protocols. If the burner does not ignite, troubleshoot the gas flow quickly to prevent unwanted discharge.

For emergency lighting, employ a recommended 9V battery. Verify polarity and secure connections before operation.

**Temperature Management**

Adjust the thermostat accordingly to maintain a consistent cooling temperature. Pay attention to the ice tray level; fill it up to just below the top for optimal ice formation. During transit, utilize the travel catch to keep the door secure.

Store food wisely, ensuring coverage and organization to prevent cross-contamination. Regularly check contents for freshness and adjust internal conditions as needed.

### Defrosting and Ice Tray Shelf Maintenance

To maintain optimal refrigeration performance, regularly defrost the appliance, typically every month or as needed. Ensure the ice tray is removed during this process. Accumulated frost can hinder efficient cooling. After defrosting, clean the ice tray and the shelf thoroughly and allow it to dry completely before reassembling. Use safe sources of heat for drying but avoid strong chemicals, abrasives, or heavily scented cleaning products on any refrigerator surfaces. 

### Usage and Power Supply

When not in use, disconnect the refrigerator from the 12V power supply. Make sure to clean and empty the unit thoroughly to prevent odors and maintain efficiency. 

### Troubleshooting Refrigerator Issues

If the refrigerator fails to operate, consult the service technician. Verify that you have followed the "Starting the Refrigerator" instructions correctly. Ensure the following:

- The bottle is empty.
- The 12V supply is connected properly with all connections intact.
- The 12V switch is in the appropriate position.
- If using 230V, confirm its connection and integrity.
- Ensure the thermostat is switched off.

Common issues may arise from excessive frost buildup, incorrect temperature settings, or improperly closed doors. If the refrigerator is not functioning correctly, a service technician may need to check the cooling system and its components.

### Maintenance Tips

Inspect hoses for any cracks, and test couplings as needed. Maintenance should be done by a qualified technician to avoid further issues.

### Additional Recommendations

Keep the refrigerator operational on 12V while in the vehicle to prevent depleting the battery. When stocking items, ensure they are appropriately packaged. 

### Service and Spare Parts

For repairs and parts, consult the telephone directory for authorized service centers.
