#### Operating Instructions

**Controls**  
The AES control system manages energy supply and establishes whether to draw from LP gas or electricity. The switch (A) activates the AES function, while the LED indicator (C) indicates its status. The thermostat (B) helps regulate temperature within the refrigerator.

**Starting the Refrigerator**  
Refer to the guidelines regarding operation with LP gas and AC power. Ensure that connections are secure, and the correct power supply is in place. For troubleshooting, consult the LED indicators.

**Switching Between Energy Sources**  
To transition between energy sources, switch off the existing source before selecting another. Continuous operation is recommended for optimal cooling efficiency.

**Winter Operation**  
To maintain efficiency in temperatures below 10°C, install winter covers. These protect the system during colder months.

**Regulating the Temperature**  
The refrigerator requires several hours to reach optimal operating temperatures. Adjust the thermostat to achieve the desired level; it can automatically manage temperature settings.

**Travel Catch**  
The catch should be secured to prevent the door from opening during travel. Ensure it is in place and all items inside are stored properly.

**Food Storage**  
Store food items keeping ventilation in mind, and avoid placing overly perishable goods near the cooling elements to prevent freezing.

**Ice-Making**  
Ensure the cooling element is functional before using ice-making features.

**Defrosting**  
Regularly defrost the refrigerator to maintain optimal performance, particularly if frost buildup exceeds the manufacturer's guidelines.

**Cleaning the Refrigerator**  
Use a damp cloth with a mild detergent to clean the interior. Avoid abrasive materials that may damage surfaces.

**Turning Off the Refrigerator**  
To turn off, switch (A) to "OFF." Empty and clean the refrigerator, especially if it will not be used for an extended period.

**Troubleshooting**  
If the refrigerator fails to operate, check the power connections and LED status for guidance on resolving issues.

#### Guarantee and Service
This refrigerator comes with a one-year warranty, with specific details available in the service directory.

#### Maintenance
Only authorized service personnel should carry out maintenance and installations. Refer to DVGW regulations (G607) for compliance.

#### Installation Instructions

**Repositioning the Hinges**  
Remove screws and washers to reposition hinges as needed. Ensure all components are assembled correctly.

**Installation/Built-In**  
Proper installation is crucial; avoid heat exposure from below the unit to maintain performance. The unit should typically face south to minimize heat accumulation.

**Ventilation of the Unit**  
Ensure proper airflow around the unit for optimal efficiency.

#### Technical Data
Refer to the technical specifications for installation requirements. Ensure all connections are secure, and proper clearances are maintained for optimal operation.

This concise version summarizes essential information while retaining the original meaning and technicality of the text.

**Technical Data Overview**

1. **LP Gas Connection**  
   The LP gas system must comply with specified regulations. It is advisable to use a feeding system that connects directly to the gas supply. For continuous operation, a bottled gas system with threaded connections is required. **Caution:** Push-on connections are not permitted for permanently operated systems. Ensure connections are properly sealed with bottled gas. The gas supply should connect to the right threaded coupling, facilitating maintenance of the gas cutoff valve.

2. **Electrical Connection**  
   All electrical systems should adhere to current I.E.E. regulations. This includes the installation of outlets and couplers compliant with BS4343/CEE17. Ensure that the electricity supply is properly earthed and the outlet is accessible. The wiring colors should follow these specifications:
   - Green-and-yellow: Earth
   - Blue: Neutral
   - Brown: Live  
   Wire terminals must match these colors accurately. It is crucial that this appliance is earthed according to regulations. When fused, verify compatibility with local standards and voltage ratings.

3. **House Battery Connection**  
   Connect the appliance directly to the house battery (+12V). The connection must facilitate operation when the vehicle is turned off; therefore, using recommended relay systems is suggested. Ensure that the wiring is routed correctly and secured.

4. **Interior Light Bulb Replacement**  
   To replace the interior light bulb, unscrew the cover and follow the proper disassembly instructions.

5. **Additional Technical Details**  
   - Cooling Capacity: Rated for operation at 25°C.
   - Recess and height measurements are available as specified.

6. **Important Note**  
   Ensure all safety measures are followed, including the correct installation and maintenance of electrical and gas components as outlined.
