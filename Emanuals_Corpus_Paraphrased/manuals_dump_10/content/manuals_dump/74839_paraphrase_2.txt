**General Information**  
These guidelines provide essential safety and operational information for installation and initial use. Ensure that installations comply with all local, state, and national standards as per ANSI Z223.1/NFPA or CSA B149. This includes isolating the gas supply during connection and testing procedures. 

**Operator's Obligations:**  
Authorized personnel must conduct operational checks at least once a year. Follow all indicated operational and safety protocols strictly. 

**Prescribed Usage:**  
Only use the fryer for its intended purpose. Avoid using sealed containers that may burst when heated. 

**Safety Practices:**  
Always ensure the fryer is properly mounted and that it does not exceed temperature limits. Avoid contact with hot surfaces to prevent burns, and ensure all fire hazards are managed, including maintaining clear access to fire control devices. 

**Technical Data and Maintenance:**  
Before performing maintenance or repairs, shut off the gas supply and disconnect the appliance. Only trained personnel should service the equipment. Regular cleaning and annual servicing are recommended for optimal performance.

**Installation Instructions:**  
Ensure proper clearance and provide sufficient insulation from heat sources during installation. Adjust the appliance height as necessary and ensure stability.

**Connecting Appliances:**  
Assemble according to the provided plans, ensuring all screws and mounting hardware are properly secured.

**Gas Connection:**  
Only authorized personnel should perform the gas connection, following local regulations. Verify compatibility with existing gas lines and ensure all connections are secure. 

**Operating Instructions:**  
The appliance should not be operated without supervision. Monitor temperature settings closely to ensure optimal performance.

**Starting the Fryer:**  
To ignite the burner, follow the specified sequence of steps for safe and effective operation. Ensure preheating is done correctly for optimum frying conditions. 

Monitor food frying closely to achieve desired results; too much food can lower oil temperature, leading to suboptimal frying. Recommended frying temperatures range from 300°F (150°C) to 350°F (180°C), depending on the type of food being cooked. 

For extensive details on operations including troubleshooting and maintenance procedures, refer to the full instruction manual.

### Switching Off the Oven Main Burner
To turn off the main burner, rotate the back knob clockwise from the highest setting to the off position. This will extinguish the pilot burner flame. Ensure the heating element has cooled before turning off the oil supply switch. After cooling, follow the procedure for maintenance, which includes using the collection cock and strainer to clean the oil bath and secure the cover on the trough.

### Changing the Frying Oil
To change the frying oil, follow these steps: turn off the cock and allow the trough to cool. Once cooled, drain the oil without opening the cock. Clean the trough thoroughly with a suitable cleaning cloth and reassemble as needed.

### Cleaning
Ensure that the oven is off and cooled down before cleaning. Turn off the gas cock and proceed with cleaning the trough using appropriate cleaning agents. A high-pressure cleaner or normal cleaning methods can be used, but avoid any bleaching products that may cause damage.

### Flame Inspection
If the flame exhibits yellow or unstable characteristics, this may indicate potential backfire conditions when the system is dirty. This requires immediate attention to ensure proper ignition and function.

### Shutdown Procedure
When shutting down, ensure that the gas supply is turned off, particularly in cold conditions (below 32°F / 0°C). Apply a thin protective coating as required for regular maintenance.

### Malfunction Handling
If a malfunction occurs, such as overheating or thermostat failure (triggered at 445°F/230°C), inform the customer service team. The heating elements must be routinely inspected for efficiency.

### General Safety Instructions
It's crucial to adhere to safety regulations and operational guidelines as specified in the ANSI Z223.1/NFPA standards. Correct usage is the user's responsibility to maintain safe working conditions. 

### Installation Guidelines
Follow all installation instructions carefully, ensuring compliance with all regulations regarding gas connections, combustible distances, and the assembly of equipment as outlined in the user manual. 

### Operational Instructions
The system features a thermostat (STB) and ignition controls, allowing for temperature settings between 180°F and 360°F. Regular maintenance and checks are necessary to ensure optimal performance. 

### Conclusion
This operating manual outlines the steps for proper use, maintenance, troubleshooting, and safety compliance. Always consult the manual for specific instructions pertaining to your equipment model.
