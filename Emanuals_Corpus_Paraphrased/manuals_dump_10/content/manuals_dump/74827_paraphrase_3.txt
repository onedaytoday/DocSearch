**General Information**
All installations must adhere to local codes and national standards, specifically ANSI Z223.1/NFPA 54 and CSA B149. The user must ensure that they understand the operation of the equipment. Operating instructions must be followed precisely for safety.

**Owner's Responsibilities**
Owners must operate the equipment in accordance with these guidelines and are responsible for regular service checks.

**Prescribed Use**
The equipment is designed solely for cooking food. Care should be taken to avoid using closed containers that can explode due to pressure build-up. Fire safety measures must be in place to prevent hazards from overheating.

**Safety-Conscious Working**
Ensure that cleaning procedures do not compromise the equipment's integrity or safety. Maintain clear paths for airflow and avoid blocking exhausts.

**Technical Data**
For efficient operation, owners should have equipment serviced regularly. Testing and maintenance must comply with regulations.

**Gas Specifications**
- Consumption: G30/31, G20, G25

**Packaging and Certifications**
The equipment is tested per ANSI/NSF standards. 

**Specification Plate**
Located on the right side; it contains essential information regarding the appliance.

**Operating Instructions**
- **Tilting Braising Pans**
These pans are sophisticated, featuring preselectable cooking options that ensure food is cooked consistently. The operating and heating processes should be initiated following specific protocols, including preheating to 320°F (160°C) for optimal performance.

**Automatic Control**
Operational controls include a timer and various temperature settings, ensuring accurate cooking temperatures are maintained. 

**Shutdown and Additional Functions**
Switching off requires a specific sequence that ensures safety and efficiency. Functions will deactivate automatically once the cooking cycle is complete.

Ensure to follow all operational and safety guidelines to maintain effectiveness and compliance with safety regulations.

**Paraphrased Text:**

The ZT LZ LR acoustic LS LC C Right operates primarily in SOFT mode, which, when deactivated, allows for quick heating of food with high thermal conductivity to prevent burning. When SOFT is activated, the heating adjusts according to the type of food being prepared, ensuring it doesn’t stick or burn. The CLOCK TIME (AZ) displays the current time, while (AT) indicates the cooking time when the switch (S) is toggled. HACCP compliance is optional and relates to the cooking process, which can be monitored using the THERMACAM. Pressing the HACCP button (C) activates its features, while the indicators (LC) and (AZ) signal various operational statuses. 

To initiate cooking, use the buttons (T), (D), and (Z); if left unattended, these buttons will flash. To halt the cooking process, simply switch off (TT) or (DT) manually. The MECHANICAL TILTING feature can be engaged via switch (H) for emptying, turning clockwise or anticlockwise as required. Once the switch (K) is released, it self-locks, allowing for safe operation. 

For effective cooking, temperatures should be set accurately based on the food type. Recommended cooking temperatures range from 110°C (230°F) for lower-end items to 250°C (482°F) for high-end items. If the temperature (AT) drops below a specific level, the heating will automatically adjust to maintain food safety. 

During cooking, if interruptions occur (e.g., loss of power), processing will resume once the supply is restored. The operational guidelines reflect proper cooking procedures, such as for meat and poultry at varying temperatures, ensuring evenly distributed heat loads. 

Cleaning instructions emphasize using appropriate cleaning products, while avoiding harsh treatments that could damage the equipment. Regular maintenance, including thorough cleaning and immediate removal of food residues, is crucial for optimal performance. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations while executing cleaning tasks to maintain hygiene and appliance longevity.

In case of troubleshooting, reference indicators (AT) for alerts, and follow protocols for service intervention if necessary. Any malfunctions or warnings (e.g., E1, E2, etc.) should be addressed promptly by summoning professional assistance. 

Commercial kitchen appliances require proper operational practices, including careful management of grease and food residues, to avoid formation issues. Cleaning should involve non-abrasive materials and adherence to safe guidelines, with particular attention paid to avoid mechanical damage. 

Users should ensure compliance with cleaning regulations as per CFR standards to maintain appliance functionality and safety throughout operation.
