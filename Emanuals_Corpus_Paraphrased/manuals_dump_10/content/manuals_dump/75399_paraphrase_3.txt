### Cooking Hints and Tips

**General Cooking Techniques**  
To achieve optimal cooking results, ensure there is adequate space between the food and the top heating element. This promotes even cooking and allows for better browning, especially with items such as Yorkshire puddings or cakes. To minimize cleaning, use cookware that is easy to maintain, such as enamelware or heavy-duty non-stick pans. Preheating your cookware before use can also enhance browning and overall cooking efficacy.

### Main Oven Cooking Chart
Follow the cooking chart closely, noting that temperatures may need adjustments depending on the shelf position. The temperature for various food items can be increased by 10°C if necessary.

| Food Item                     | Temperature (°C) | Shelf Position |
|-------------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Custard                       |                  |                |
| Choux Eclairs/Profiteroles    |                  |                |
| Roasting Meat/Poultry        |                  |                |
| Shepherd's Pie               |                  |                |
| Yorkshire Pudding             |                  |                |
| Christmas Shortbread         |                  |                |
| Shortcrust Mince Tarts      |                  |                |

### Roasting Chart
Ensure you adhere to the recommended internal temperatures and cooking times for meat as follows:

- For 50-60°C, aim for a cook time of 160-180°C.
- For 60-70°C, keep within the same temperature range.
- Adjust accordingly for greater temperatures.

### Pizza Cooking
When cooking pizza, ensure that the food is placed centrally on the shelf for even cooking. Heavy or non-stick pans can enhance browning and help distribute heat evenly.

### Fan-Controlled Defrosting
The fan-controlled defrosting option warms food without cooking it and is particularly effective for items with icings or frostings. Remember that food should be monitored throughout the defrosting process to ensure it does not cook when thawing; this is especially crucial for meats, which should be cooked immediately after thawing.

### SpeedCook Function
This function allows for cooking without preheating, enabling a faster cooking experience. However, some adjustments to cooking times and temperatures may be necessary.

### Rotitherm Roasting
This feature is designed for cooking foods traditionally roasted at higher temperatures. Maintain the door closed during operation for best results, and adjust cooking times based on the specific meal requirements.

### Care and Cleaning
Ensure the oven cools down before disconnecting it from the power supply. Use only recommend cleaning products that do not contain bleach or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the appliance's finishes. For internal cleaning, ovens equipped with Stayclean technology usually require less manual cleaning.

### Cleaning Oven Glass
To clean the outer glass, gently remove screws and carefully lift the glass panel for access. For heavy stains, use a specialized cleaner. Repair any chips or scratches promptly to prevent shattering.

### Light Bulb Replacement
Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before changing the bulb. Use a screwdriver to remove the cover, replace the bulb, and securely reassemble everything before restoring power. 

By following these guidelines, you can achieve excellent cooking results while maintaining your appliance effectively.

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue:** If the appliance is not functioning properly, please check the service. It should proceed without charge for mechanical failures or breakdowns. Ensure that the device was purchased through the appropriate channels and is properly wired to the power supply, with the clock set correctly. If cooling is inadequate, confirm that the cooling function is enabled and operates correctly. 

Follow Service Force instructions closely for optimal operation. Confirm that the selected cooking function distributes heat evenly and that the light is functioning. If the temperature is set too high or low, adjust according to recommendations. Use the specified temperature range (e.g., ±10°C).

**Possible Solutions:** 
If the appliance is overheating, allow it to cool for several hours before attempting further use. Ensure the shelf is positioned as recommended. If there are issues with the cooking light, check the arrangement of the shelves and ensure they are properly situated.
