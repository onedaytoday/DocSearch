**SST Series Operation Manuals**

This manual covers the operation and maintenance for the SST1000, SST1400, SST1600, and SST2000 air cleaner models from White-Rodgers, a subsidiary of Emerson. Please refer to the specific operating instructions contained herein for proper installation, service, and operational guidelines.

**Safety Precautions**

When servicing these units, ensure that the power is turned off to prevent the risk of electric shock, which could lead to severe injury or fatality. Use appropriate tools and follow safety instructions diligently. Failure to comply may result in reduced equipment performance or dangerous conditions.

**Table of Contents**

The manual includes sections on the unit's construction, specifications, installation requirements, technical service details, and warnings regarding electrical connections.

**Air Cleaner Functionality**

The operation begins with air flowing through the pre-filter, where larger particles are trapped. The air then moves into the primary charging section, where it receives an electric charge, followed by a collecting section that consists of charged plates that attract and capture finer particles. White filtration effectively removes dust and pollutants, providing clean air.

**Construction Overview**

The air cleaner is designed for easy installation with components that can be mounted onto existing ductwork. The assembly includes various sections for collecting and filtering airborne particles. Ensure alignment and connection of the wires to guarantee proper functionality.

**Installation Guidelines**

Select an installation location that allows adequate airflow and complies with specified clearance requirements specific to each model (SST1000, SST1400, SST1600, and SST2000). Important: Ensure that the unit is positioned correctly relative to the heating or cooling system to maintain optimal efficiency.

**Airflow Direction**

The air cleaner typically operates with airflow directed from left to right upon factory shipment. Adjustments can be made to reverse flow direction if necessary.

**Mounting Positions**

Various mounting configurations are possible, depending on the system's layout, including basement and horizontal furnace installations. Ensure that all components are securely fastened and appropriately aligned for effective operation.

**Additional Considerations**

When installing the air cleaner, follow all guidelines for proper positioning and clearance to avoid interference with air circulation.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Remove the Old Filter**: Detach and dispose of the old filter.
  
2. **Clean the Blower Compartment**: Ensure the blower motor and housing are thoroughly cleaned. The installation typically involves facing the upright model correctly.

3. **Mounting**: Release the latch and detach the blower from the collecting compartment if needed. Ensure the mounting aligns properly, and securely attach all components. If applicable, use the optional attachment method for the transition section, maintaining downward airflow.

### Wiring Instructions
- Ensure the electrical connections comply with safety standards. Connect the appropriate wires to the terminal blocks. 
- Caution with grounding: Use outdoor grounding type cords to prevent electric shocks. Verify that the outlet type matches the required specifications for safety. 

### Operation Guidelines
- With the power supply on, toggle the ON-OFF switch to activate the blower. Occasionally, you might hear arcing sounds; this is generally normal unless persistent. Ensure the operational light is illuminated. If not, check for issues with the power supply or unit settings.

### Maintenance Procedures
- Regular cleaning is essential for efficiency and safety; inspect and clean at least once a month. Handle all components carefully as they may have sharp edges.
  
**Cleaning Cells**: Power off the device before cleaning. Release and lift the collecting cells for maintenance, ensuring wires are free from debris. Allow adequate drying time after cleaning.

### Ionizing Wire Replacement
- If needed, replace the ionizing wire according to the specific guidelines for secure installation.

### Specifications
- **Models**: SST1000, SST1400, SST1600, SST2000.
- Ensure electrical ratings are compatible with the application.

### Service Guide
- This guide is intended for authorized service technicians. Take necessary precautions while troubleshooting electrical components to prevent the risk of injury or worse outcomes. 

### Technical Repair Guidance
- Only qualified personnel should perform service tasks. This includes diagnosing issues related to high-voltage supplies and airflow mechanisms, ensuring proper repair techniques meet manufacturer specifications.

# Power Supply Checkout Procedure

**1. Power Supply Configuration**  
- Set the switch to the OFF position, then connect the flow switch and cover.  
- Connect the flow switch to the three-pin connector (with the white wire corresponding to the white-brown wire) as illustrated.  
- Ensure the lead wires are insulated from the chassis and connect the high voltage supply to the AC switch in the ON position.  

**2. Voltage Check**  
- If the indicator light turns ON and you observe the correct VDC supply, continue testing.  
- If the light does not illuminate, inspect the components for bowed, bent, loose, or cracked insulators, which may require replacement.  

**3. Air Flow Monitor Test**  
- Apply VAC to the supply terminals while the switch is in the ON position.  
- Test the thermistor by blowing on it; a VAC reading should appear shortly after. If the test fails, consult the specifications for acceptable values. Disconnect the three-pin connector and recheck configurations.  

**4. Ozone Reduction Systems**  
- Note that ozone reduction systems are typically designed to meet high customer demands. Ensure that the supply is compatible with the operational requirements of electronic air cleaners (EAC) that have been retrofitted (ACR kits).  

**Installation Details:**  
Carefully follow the installation guidelines to secure the components as indicated. Connect the grounding as shown, ensuring that all connections are tight and properly insulated.  

## Wiring Information  
- Follow the wiring instructions meticulously to achieve the expected operational outcomes. Identify wire colors for each connection:  
  - WHT/BRN (White/Brown), BLK (Black)

## Parts List  
Ensure that part numbers and descriptions align correctly with the model specifications:
