**Food Placement and Cooking Guidelines**

Position food centrally on the shelf to ensure even cooking. It’s essential to leave space around the dish to prevent splashing and allow for proper air circulation. Food should be cooked thoroughly to prevent splatter. When cooking meats, use a light coating of oil to enhance browning. Preheat the oven to a high temperature before cooking, and adjust as necessary during the process.

**Top Oven Guidelines**

The top shelf of the oven is optimal for certain types of food. Ensure food is arranged evenly to promote thorough cooking. Always preheat the oven before placing food inside. To operate, turn on the oven until the indicator light comes on. 

**Key Notes:**

- Ensure the top oven is functioning properly and cools down after use.
- Arrange shelves so they are straight and aligned at the back for stability.

**Food Preparation Tips**

For effective cooking, center food on the shelf and give it space around the tray or dish. This technique helps in reducing spillage and aids in cleanup. Use enamelware or heavy-duty cookware to facilitate better browning. 

**Main Oven Heat Zones**

Different areas within the main oven exhibit varying heat levels, with the top being slightly hotter. It’s advisable to adjust your cooking position based on the food type and desired cooking results. Always preheat the main oven for optimal performance.

**Cooking Chart**

For various foods, especially during special occasions like Christmas, refer to cooking guidelines for specific items. Adjust cooking times according to the shelf position.

**Roasting Temperatures and Timings**

Follow recommended internal temperatures for different meats, adjusting as necessary for even cooking. Covering food can help retain moisture during roasting.

---

**Slow Cooking Tips**

When slow cooking tougher cuts of meat, it’s more economical. To retain moisture, cover dishes tightly. Ensure food reaches an internal temperature of at least 88°C. 

**Care and Maintenance**

Allow the appliance to cool down before switching it off for cleaning. Use recommended cleaning products to maintain finishes; avoid bleach. Clean the exterior with a cloth, and take care not to scratch surfaces.

**Cleaning Components**

For removable components like wire racks and burners, clean as directed. Replace parts carefully to ensure proper function. 

**Grill and Oven Cleaning**

The interior and surfaces of the grill and oven should be cleaned manually as needed. The Stayclean coating helps in reducing maintenance but should still be regularly cleaned according to manufacturer guidelines.

**Door Maintenance**

To clean between the glass panes, follow specific steps to safely remove and replace the outer glass, ensuring it’s correctly oriented upon reinstallation.

For further maintenance inquiries, consult service professionals as needed.
