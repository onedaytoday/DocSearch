The EI30HI55K Dishwasher offers convenient cleaning features alongside luxury design lighting. You can select between the integrated or remote blower options, as well as the CFM (cubic feet per minute) rated for both types. This model includes a 30-inch integrated blower with varied CFM settings, depending on your installation preferences.

For optimal performance, the appliance is designed to connect to a 120V grounded service and must comply with the specified CFM ratings for different installations. The dishwasher is compatible with various blower models, including the EI06HIPIKS and EI12HIPIKS for integrated blowers and EI06HIPRKS and EI12HIPRKS for remote blowers.

Installation must follow the product's specifications, ensuring proper venting in accordance with building codes. It is advisable to use round ducting for improved performance, avoiding square or other shapes that could impede airflow. Take note that products are subject to ongoing updates, and specifications may change without prior notice.
