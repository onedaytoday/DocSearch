- Ensure all burner heads and grates are correctly placed before operation.

### Using the Wok Stand

- Designed for round-bottomed cookware; ensure proper positioning to avoid heat damage.
- Flat-bottom cookware does not function effectively with the wok stand.

Please follow all instructions carefully to ensure optimal appliance performance and safety.

### Using the Simmer Plate

To use the simmer plate, ensure that it is positioned correctly on the cooking surface by aligning it with the notches. Always use potholders to prevent burns when handling the plate, as it can retain high heat. Allow the plate to cool before placing it on heat-sensitive surfaces like countertops.

### Setting Surface Controls

Select the appropriate surface controls based on the type and quantity of food being cooked. The control lights will illuminate when activated. Caution: flammable items such as paper or kitchen towels should be kept away from hot surfaces to prevent fire hazards. Do not attempt to light the burner manually with a match; follow the provided instructions for proper lighting.

### Getting Started with the Oven

Ensure the oven is cool before installing rack supports and arranging the oven racks. These should be set up before operating the oven. When using the self-clean feature, make sure the oven is cool to avoid burns.

### Recommended Rack Positions for Baking

For optimal results when baking, arrange the oven racks to allow air circulation around the cookware. This ensures even heat distribution.

### Control Features

Thoroughly read the instructions before using the oven to familiarize yourself with its features. The selector control knob allows selection between functions like Convection Bake, Broil, and Clean. 

### Baking Tips

When baking cookies or bread, ensure correct preheating and avoid overcrowding to prevent uneven cooking or burning. Adjustments may be necessary if your food relies on medium-weight ingredients. 

### Convection Baking and Roasting

Convection cooking enhances heat circulation and reduces cooking times. When using the convection function, preheat the oven to the desired temperature for even cooking.

### Broiling Instructions

For broiling, preheat the oven and season the food as necessary. Monitor the cooking closely to prevent grease fires. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; instead, follow proper procedures to ensure safety.

### Self-Cleaning Feature

Before using the self-clean feature, allow the oven to cool and wear appropriate cleaners and protection. Avoid using any other cleaning products that could interfere with the self-clean process. 

Remember to follow all safety precautions while cleaning, particularly regarding food and high-heat items. The self-cleaning program will use elevated temperatures to thoroughly clean the oven cavity, but ensure all racks and items that cannot withstand high heat are removed prior to operation.

### Oven Self-Clean Cycle Instructions

#### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle:
To initiate the self-cleaning process, ensure the oven has cooled down. This typically takes about an hour. When starting the self-clean cycle, it may take approximately two to four hours to complete. 

**Warning:** The oven will become very hot during this process. Keep children away from the appliance, and do not attempt to force the oven door open when the lock is engaged.

#### General Cleaning:
Before cleaning, ensure the oven is off and has cooled. Promptly remove any spills or heavy soiling, as regular cleanings can minimize the need for extensive cleanings later.

- For painted or plastic surfaces, use a soft cloth. Avoid using steel wool or abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the surface.
- Wipe down any built-up grease using a cloth, and refrain from using harsh cleaners on sensitive areas.
- When cleaning, make sure to turn off and unplug the appliance if necessary.

### Cleaning the Burner Components
#### Burner Grates, Caps, Heads, and Accessories:
Ensure the burners and their components are completely cooled before cleaning. The grates and burner heads can be cleaned using warm, soapy water or in the dishwasher. 

**Caution:** Do not allow spills, food residues, or cleaners to obstruct the gas orifice holder. Always check that the parts are installed correctly.

### Cooktop Maintenance
For ceramic glass cooktops:
- Ensure the appliance is turned off and cool before cleaning.
- Avoid using coarse cleaners or materials that could scratch the surface. 

### Oven Door Removal and Replacement
To remove the oven door, locate the hinges at the front. Follow the instructions in the special care section carefully to prevent scratches or damage.

### Oven Light Maintenance
The oven light can be activated using the switch. The glass shield protecting the light must always be in place during operation. Clean it carefully when the oven is cool.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues:
- **Surface Burners Won't Ignite:** Ensure that the burner control is set to the "lite" position and check for clogged gas flow.
- **Burner Flame Half Ignited:** This may indicate a blockage; follow the cleaning instructions.
- **Orange Flame:** Suggests incomplete combustion; you may need professional servicing.
- **Discoloration or Scratches on Cooktop:** Use recommended cleaners to avoid further damage.
- **Appliance Leveling Issues:** Check the appliance's positioning for optimal baking results.

#### General Performance Issues:
- If the oven doesn't operate, check for power supply issues, connections, and ensure the circuit hasnâ€™t tripped.
- For excessive smoke during broiling, reposition the meat to ensure proper searing. Clean away any grease build-up frequently.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can maintain the functionality and longevity of your oven and cooktop.

### Issues with Self-Cleaning Cycle

**Problem:** The standard self-cleaning cycle is not functioning properly. Ensure the instructions are followed correctly. The self-cleaning process may be interrupted, causing the indicator light to turn off after a few seconds. 

**Residual Soil:** If soil remains in the oven after the self-cleaning cycle, you may need to manually clean it or assist with the removal of smoke or flames caused by excessive grease.
