To effectively execute this instruction, please adhere to it thoroughly. This includes references to SAFETY INFORMATION, which outlines considerations for children and individuals with reduced capabilities. The CONTROL PANEL details include switching on and off functions like COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC, as well as guidelines for first-time use, regular cleaning, and food storage recommendations.

Essential safety notes emphasize the importance of following directions to prevent hazards such as suffocation or electrical shock. It cautions against overheating and the risks associated with obstructed mechanical parts. Always ensure the appliance remains in compliance with safety standards.

For initial setup, unpack the unit and let it stabilize for at least four hours before use to allow internal temperatures to normalize. Avoid contact with the rear and sides, where high temperatures can occur. Only service the appliance with authorized personnel, complying with environmental regulations, and disposing of materials responsibly.

The CONTROL PANEL includes a light indicator and ON/OFF switching capabilities for both the COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC functions. Pressing these buttons prompts the desired cooling settings, which can automatically revert if not adjusted. The current temperature display and operational status are indicated by flashing numbers.

To use the COOLMATIC function, it is activated to rapidly cool fresh food stored inside. Conversely, the FROSTMATIC function preserves already frozen foods. Immediately clean the internal components upon first use and before regular operation.

Daily operations should account for load capacity, ensuring that fresh food does not exceed the prescribed limits to maintain efficiency. Keep food items organized and avoid overcrowding to optimize airflow, thus preserving freshness. All food should be properly covered to avoid contamination or spoilage.

Notably, the effectiveness of freezing and cooling foods is contingent upon adequate shelf positioning—front shelves may cater to specific item types while rear shelves accommodate others. Clean the surfaces regularly to ensure optimal performance.

Helpful tips include wrapping meat and other food items in polythene or airtight materials. Be cautious of food storage arrangements to avoid cross-contamination, maintaining an efficient cooling cycle. 

Please adhere to these guidelines to ensure the appliance provides the best performance while maintaining food quality and safety.
