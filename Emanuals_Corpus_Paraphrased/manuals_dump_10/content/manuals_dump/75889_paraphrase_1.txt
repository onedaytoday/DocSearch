**Defrosting and Cleaning Procedures**

To defrost an appliance, ensure that the frost-covered areas are cleared when turned off. Refer to the "Cleaning" section for detailed cleaning instructions and the rationale behind regular maintenance. Caution! Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning to avoid electric shock. Use a suitable cleaner designed for such tasks, ensuring that the food remains properly stored. 

Make sure the appliance is turned off when cleaning; use a cloth to wipe down surfaces as needed. It’s essential to maintain cleanliness using approved cleaning agents. Ensure the appliance is located in a well-ventilated area to maintain optimal operation. Allow hot foods to cool before placing them inside, as this helps prevent internal temperatures from dropping excessively.

**Addressing Operational Malfunctions**

If the appliance fails to cool efficiently, the following troubleshooting steps should be followed. Symptoms might include frost buildup or the appliance not turning on due to a blown fuse. Ensure all controls are functioning properly and that the unit is properly plugged in. Adjust settings as necessary. 

If issues persist, please contact Service Force for assistance. It’s crucial to report any warning lights or other abnormal indicators as noted in the appliance manual. 

**Operational Sounds**
