**Tension 031210-JA Projection Screen Installation Instructions**

To assemble the projection screen, you'll need a screwdriver to secure the connecting components to the Connector Housing. Make sure to thread the screws completely into the housing until they fit snugly. Once all connections are firmly in place, rotate the screwdriver clockwise to secure the Head Screwdriver to the Connector Housing.

For proper operation, the IR, RF, or wall switch should be correctly positioned in the housing. Follow the specific assembly instructions for connecting components labeled C, D, and H, ensuring the connections are made according to the schematics.

**Shelf Installation:** Ensure the installation height is set appropriately. The Infrared-Sensitive Safety Device (ISSD) can be triggered if the light beams are obstructed, causing the screen to close automatically. If this occurs, remove any obstacles in the way. Clean the surfaces using a soft cloth to maintain the device's longevity, and avoid exposing the product to extreme heat or fire.
