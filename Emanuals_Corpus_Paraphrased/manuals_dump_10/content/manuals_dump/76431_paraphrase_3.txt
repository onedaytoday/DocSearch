### Sorting and Drying Guidelines

**Sorting Instructions:** 
Sort laundry according to categories: 

- Whites
- Colors
- Synthetics 
- Normally soiled items (includes shirts, towels, tablecloths, and sheets)

When washing whites and colors, it is advisable to wash whites separately to preserve their brightness. New colored items should be washed first to avoid color bleeding. Pair pillowcases and lighter clothing with similar colors. Specific items like synthetics may require cooler washes to prevent shrinkage.

**Washing Tips:** 
When treating stubborn stains like grease or lipstick, use appropriate stain removers and consider bleach for whites and colorfast items. Follow treatment with cold washing when applicable. When using bleach, be sure it's suitable for the fabric.

**Machine Settings:** 
Select washing cycles according to the fabric type: 

- Whites and colored items can handle high heat (around 60°C).
- Synthetics and delicate fabrics typically require lower temperatures.

Ensure washing loads aren't tightly packed to allow proper cleaning.

**Drying Recommendations:** 
For drying, follow the manufacturer’s instructions on temperature settings. Utilize options like reduced drying heat for delicate or synthetic fabrics. Regular maintenance of the dryer’s filters and ducts is essential for optimal performance.

**Maintenance and Safety:** 
Disconnect power when performing maintenance, and follow cleaning instructions carefully. Check the water supply connections and clean lint from filters regularly. Also, ensure the drainage hose is free of blockages to prevent water from backing up. 

**Troubleshooting:** 
If the machine displays error codes like E10 or E20, check water connections and ensure proper loading. In case of frequent malfunctions, consult customer service for assistance. 

**Final Notes:** 
Always refer to the specific guidelines provided for your machine model to ensure effective washing and drying, and maintain good fabric care practices for longevity.
