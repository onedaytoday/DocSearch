**CKS1701 User Manual Summary**

**SNOOZE Feature**: The SNOOZE function operates by allowing you to temporarily silence the alarm. The alarm will automatically turn off after a set duration. To adjust the duration of the SNOOZE, press the appropriate button.

**DIMMER Adjustment**: The brightness of the display can be adjusted. For a brighter display, set the dimmer to HI. If the display is too bright, switch it to LO.

**Battery Replacement**: The device requires a CR2430 3V lithium battery, which may need replacement over time. Factors such as usage frequency can affect the lifespan of the battery. The clock can also be powered by an AC supply. When the battery is low, a LOW BATT warning will flash. To replace the battery, carefully remove the cover using a screwdriver, ensuring not to lose the small screw.

**Memory Function**: The clock stores time and date settings, which can be lost if the internal lithium battery runs out. If the clock shows a LOW BATT warning, it is essential to replace the battery to maintain memory. To reset the time and date, press and hold the MONTH/DATE and TIME buttons, then use the SET button to adjust the settings according to your preferences. 

**Care Instructions**: To clean the clock, dust it with a soft cloth. For tougher stains, use a slightly damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals.
