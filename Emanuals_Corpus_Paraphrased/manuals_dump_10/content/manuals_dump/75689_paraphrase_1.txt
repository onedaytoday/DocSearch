**Chiller/Chilling Process:** The process involves cooling cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively reducing bacterial growth during this transition. The food must be further cooled to -18°C within four hours. This chilling and freezing method ensures food safety and extends shelf life without compromising quality. The equipment is designed for optimal performance and includes built-in features for ease of use.

**Operating Modes:** The chiller operates in different modes, namely Soft Chilling (at +2°C) and standard chilling (at +20°C), allowing for variable cooling based on requirements. The ARTE system continuously monitors the cooling process upon food insertion. It adheres to NF and UK regulations and is equipped with UV options (as accessories) for enhanced sanitation. Built-in displays provide countdown timers and service information (P1, P2), recording data related to HACCP compliance, especially if any operating anomalies occur.

**Performance:** The chilling capability is contingent upon the type of food and adheres to NF performance standards.

**Construction and Finishing:** The chiller is constructed with AISI-grade materials and features a high-density polyurethane insulation that is HCFC-free, with ISO certification for manufacturing. The design includes rounded corners and IP20 protection.

**Technical Data:** 
- **Freezers:** Specifications include productivity metrics per NF and UK chilling regulations. 
- **Cooling System:** Built-in depth and height dimensions are provided with specific GN types of installations. 
- **Power Supply:** Details include electrical supply specifications (V, phases).

**Included Accessories:** 
- Single sensor probes for both chiller and freezer applications.
- Various racks and hangers compatible with standard ovens.
- HACCP compliance kits and advanced connectivity options.

**Installation Requirements:** The unit requires proper installation, and plumbing may be necessary, with optional cleaning accessories available.

**Certification:** The equipment meets hygiene standards as per NF031, certified by AFAQ AFNOR, which assesses cleaning efficacy and thermal performance.

**Legend:** Product models and specifications are referenced as RBF101, RBF1016, and HDBA020.
