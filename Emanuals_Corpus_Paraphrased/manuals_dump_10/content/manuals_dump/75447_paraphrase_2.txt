### Overview of Cookware and Cooking Parameters

The arrangement of the heating elements influences the distribution of heat to the cookware. The selection and type of cookware, along with its characteristics, dictate how effectively heat is transferred during cooking. Surrounding temperatures can escalate to levels that risk burning. 

When selecting cookware, refer to the recommended types and follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially regarding cleaning and maintenance. Cookware should be flat and balanced to ensure even heat distribution. Avoid using warped or uneven utensils, which can impede performance.

- **Material Properties**: 
  - Aluminum conducts heat quickly but can be easily scratched. 
  - Copper heats evenly and rapidly. 
  - Stainless steel provides a stable cooking surface but may require more time to heat up. 
  - Cast iron retains heat well but has a slower heating response, making it unsuitable for certain cooktops. 
  - Porcelain-enameled metals have a smooth finish but can scratch easily. 
  - Glass cookware is not recommended as it can scratch the cooktop surface.

### Heating Controls and Features

The cooking interface features an LCD display, indicating each heating zone's status. The system allows for precise temperature adjustments, including settings for high and low heat. When the heating element is activated, a light indicates its status, and caution should be exercised to prevent burns, particularly when handling items that can easily catch fire, like potholders.

### Preheating Options

The appliance includes a preheat function that can be set to various temperatures. For optimal results, it is advisable to preheat to designated temperatures before use. Utilize specific commands to initiate the preheating process, with audible alerts signaling readiness. The preheating function can be canceled if necessary.

### Cooking Guidance

For successful cooking outcomes, it’s vital to monitor the cooking time, temperature, and method. Different features such as convection cooking and defrosting modes can be employed depending on the food type. It's recommended to adhere to suggested cooking temperatures and times to avoid foodborne illness.

In cases of fire, such as grease fires, never attempt to extinguish flames with water—covering the source with a lid or utilizing a fire extinguisher is advisable.

### Convection Cooking

Utilizing the Perfect-Convect feature optimizes heat distribution by continuously circulating air. This requires adherence to specific guidelines provided for convection cooking to ensure the best results. The process is initiated via the control panel, and similar to the preheating function, progress indicators display readiness.

In summary, careful selection of cookware, precise temperature control, and adherence to cooking guidelines are critical for effective and safe cooking outcomes.

### Convection Cooking Overview

**Convection Cooking Principles**  
Convection cooking effectively heats meat and poultry by circulating hot air around the food, ensuring even cooking and reducing cooking times. For optimal performance, adhere to the following temperatures: 350°F (176°C) for general cooking, 170°F (76°C) for poultry, and up to 550°F (288°C) for specific items.

**Preheating Instructions**  
Preheat the oven according to the type of food being prepared. To initiate cooking, press the UPPER OVEN button, select ROAST, and then press START. If changes are needed during the process, the cooking can be paused or canceled.

**Roasting Guidelines**  
When roasting, ensure the grease catch is in place, and properly position the food to facilitate even heat distribution. Recommended temperatures include 350°F to 400°F for whole meats and 325°F for poultry. Items such as pre-cooked meats should be roasted at 325°F (160°C). Utilize a roasting shield to prevent over-browning.

**Internal Temperature Checking**  
To confirm proper cooking, verify the internal temperature at the thickest point of the meat without touching bones. The minimum safe temperatures are as follows: 170°F (76°C) for poultry and 130°F (54°C) for certain other meats. Ensure the probe is correctly inserted for accurate readings.

**Defrosting Instructions**  
Defrost food items such as cakes and cheesecakes slowly without heat. Use the UPPER OVEN's DEFROST function by pressing the corresponding buttons and selecting START. Follow USDA guidelines for safe thawing practices.

**Slow Cooking Functions**  
When using the slow-cook option, ensure foods are thawed completely. Cover items to prevent moisture loss. Settings vary, with HI cooking at 275°F (134°C) and LO at 225°F (108°C).

**Bread Proofing**  
For proofing yeast-leavened products, select the BREAD PROOF function. Set temperatures between 85°F (30°C) and 100°F (38°C) to ensure proper dough rising.

**Cooking Multiple Stages**  
In complex cooking scenarios, use the MULTI-STAGE feature to program different cooking phases, adjusting temperatures up to 500°F as necessary. 

**Sabbath/Holiday Mode**  
This function disables lights and tones for uninterrupted cooking during observed days. To activate, initiate BAKE and set the COOK TIME. The system will indicate its active state through visual cues. 

If further clarification or assistance is required, please consult the detailed instructions or contact support for help.

### Sabbath Mode Instructions

To activate Sabbath Mode, simultaneously press both the LO and HI buttons until a sound indicates activation. After you've activated it, you can cancel Sabbath Mode by following the same steps.

When using the upper or lower oven for cooking, ensure you set the desired temperature correctly. Common cooking temperatures include 350°F (176°C), 450°F (232°C), and 170°F (76°C). Using appropriate cookware is essential to prevent burning.

To initiate cooking, press BAKE and then START. The oven will preheat, and once the target temperature is reached, preheating will stop automatically. If at any point you want to cancel the cooking process, simply press CANCEL.

### Wave-Touch User Preferences

To modify user preferences, press USER PREF, then choose your desired setting using the directional buttons. You can adjust temperature preferences or set the clock by following similar steps and pressing START to confirm.

The factory clock setting is adjustable; you can select between F or C for temperature settings. If the factory offsets need adjustment (either +35°F or -35°F), navigate through USER PREF to tweak these settings.

### Self-Cleaning Instructions 

For the self-cleaning cycle, ensure no items are left inside the oven. You can select light, medium, or heavy cleaning options. Once chosen, press START, and the door will lock automatically during the cleaning process.

After cleaning is complete, wait for the oven to cool before attempting to unlock the door. If you need to cancel the self-cleaning, pressing CANCEL will terminate the process.

### General Cleaning Procedures

For regular maintenance, use a soft cloth to clean painted and decorative surfaces. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrubbers, and instead apply cleaning solutions directly to the cloth. Thoroughly wipe down the exterior and ensure no grease buildup is left behind.

If the oven has self-clean settings, follow the manufacturer's guidelines carefully to maintain its integrity. Also, avoid lining the oven drawer or racks with foil to ensure proper airflow and cleanliness.

### Safety Measures

Take precautions against burns during cleaning. Always wait for the oven to cool completely before handling any components. Use protective gear if necessary, and don’t attempt to force open locked doors or disassemble parts without proper knowledge of the procedure.

The oven's performance can be improved with regular maintenance, so follow these steps to ensure optimal cooking results.
