### Drying of Synthetics

**Auto-Drying Process**
To initiate the auto-drying process for synthetic fabrics, select the appropriate settings using the designated buttons. Ensure that the load is not overly packed to facilitate optimal drying. For best results, use the lowest heat setting suitable for synthetics and remember to switch off the machine once the cycle is complete. 

**Sorting Guidelines**
When sorting laundry, follow these categories: whites, colors, synthetics, and various fabric types (e.g., towels, bed linens). Always wash new colored items separately to prevent color bleeding. Light-colored clothes can attract lint and should be washed in accordance with their care instructions to maintain their integrity. 

**Stain Treatment Recommendations**
For stubborn stains, consider pre-treating items overnight. Use suitable cleaning methods according to the stain type—bleach is applicable exclusively for whites and colorfast items. Follow the instructions for bleach application and avoid mixing with incompatible fabrics.

**Washing Instructions**
Use an appropriate temperature setting for washing synthetics, ideally up to 60°C. Pre-wash may or may not be utilized based on soil level. The washer-dryer includes options for cleaning additives that aid in stain removal and fabric care.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**
Regular maintenance is essential for optimal performance. Clean the lint filter and check hoses to ensure unimpeded water flow. If there are performance issues, check for clogs or errors indicated by the display. If necessary, disconnect the power supply before proceeding with troubleshooting.

**Error Handling**
If the machine displays error codes (like E10, E20, E40), it indicates specific issues related to water supply or loading. Follow the troubleshooting steps provided in the manual to rectify any errors. 

**Technical Specifications**
Refer to the technical rating plate for specifications regarding water supply and fabric handling. Each fabric type has guidelines for optimal washing and drying temperatures, detailed in the accompanying charts.

**Unpacking Instructions**
When unpacking, ensure that all protective materials are removed and that hoses are not pinched or damaged. Follow proper assembly instructions to ensure safe operation.
