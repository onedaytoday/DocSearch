### Attention Signage & Operational Guidelines

**WARNING: STARTING THE MOTOR**  
Prior to operation, ensure the thermal switch is functioning correctly. If the system is overloaded, the thermal switch will engage. Allow it to cool down before resetting. For proper use, connect to ground and clearly identify the on/off switch.

**WARNING: EXTENSION CABLES**  
When connecting to a power network, ensure recommended cable lengths are used to avoid overload. Verify that the earth plate is insulated properly.

**STOPPING THE ENGINE**  
To stop the engine, immediately release the switch. Be cautious of mechanical wear, especially when handling the equipment near the ground.

**OIL FILLING & CHAIN LUBRICATION**  
Regularly check the oil and chain lubrication to minimize wear. Use the appropriate type of oil to maintain optimal performance.

**BRAKE FUNCTIONALITY CHECK**  
Inspect brake operations prior to use. Ensure manual or inertial chain brakes engage and release effectively for safety during operation.

**SAFETY DEVICES**  
Ensure all safety devices, particularly the start switch, are functioning correctly. Always release the switch fully when not in use to avoid accidental startups.

**STORAGE PRECAUTIONS**  
Follow safety regulations for storage. Clean the equipment thoroughly and store it in a cool, dry place, keeping it away from heat sources.

**CUTTING INSTRUCTIONS**  
Be cautious when bucking; ensure proper support when cutting to avoid pinching. Follow established cutting guidelines to prevent injuries.

**CHAIN SHARPENING**  
Regularly sharpen the chain and maintain it as per the recommended schedule. Disconnect from power and follow safety measures during sharpening.

This operational guide emphasizes the importance of following all safety regulations to enhance equipment performance and reduce risks associated with usage.

**DAILY MAINTENANCE OF ELECTRIC SAWS: INSPECTION/REPLACEMENT OF BRUSHES**

Routine maintenance of electric saws includes the careful inspection and replacement of contact brushes every few hours, as recommended by authorized service centers. It is crucial to use **original spare parts** for all repairs. 

**WARNING:** All maintenance tasks should be performed with the tool disconnected and protective gear worn. Overheating can occur if the saw is obstructed or improperly maintained, leading to potential damage.

To ensure the longevity of the equipment, follow the recommended service guidelines and consult authorized workshops when necessary.
