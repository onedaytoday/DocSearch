The LW GN line is designed to enhance both creativity and professional functionality in culinary operations. It provides versatile cooking options, including cook and chill methods, tailored to specific requirements. 

The GN operating modes, such as convection, allow for cooking meat evenly without the need for gratin. Additionally, a half-power function ensures food is cooked with steam, preserving its quality while reducing weight and cooking time. This includes options for various types of food, such as cakes, and the ability to hold and maintain temperature.

Built-in cleaning features and HACCP compliance enable tracking of cooking processes. The technical specifications indicate a cooking chamber height and various performance displays that monitor the cooking atmosphere.

The construction includes thermo-glazed surfaces for safety and minimization of build-up, with an IPX5 protection rating. 

Accessories for this line include GN1/1 grids for whole chickens, frying baskets, baking trays, banquet racks, and various support units. Additional options enhance functionality, such as automatic water softeners, exhaust hoods with or without fans, and separate cleaning systems.

The system also supports HACCP integration and offers a variety of non-stick pans and thermal covers, ensuring efficient operation in busy kitchen environments.
