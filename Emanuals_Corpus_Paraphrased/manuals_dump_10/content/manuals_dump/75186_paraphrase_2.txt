### Instructions 

**Preheating**  
To preheat the oven, set the temperature between 170°F and 550°F based on cooking requirements. For 350°F, press the "PRE" or other designated buttons, and wait for the indicator to show that the desired temperature has been reached. Once preheated, you can place food inside the oven. If preheating to 425°F while cooking, keep an eye on the display, as it will indicate when it has reached the set temperature. 

**Baking**  
Ensure to preheat according to the instructions provided. Start at 350°F, and monitor the area between racks to allow for proper heat circulation. Avoid overcrowding the oven, as it can lead to uneven cooking or burning. If cooking cookies, bread, or cakes, be mindful of the recommended temperatures and adjust as necessary. 

**Convection Baking**  
Convection baking circulates hot air around the food, which aids in faster cooking and even heat distribution. When thawing or roasting, you may need to test various temperatures and adjustments based on your food type. Always follow the recommended guidelines for the best results, and avoid overcrowding.

### Set Timed Bake or Timed Convection Bake  
To initiate a timed bake, set the temperature and the cooking duration. The oven will turn off automatically when done. Consult your settings to ensure all adjustments are correct, and check that your food is properly placed.

**Broiling**  
Preheat the broiler as instructed, allowing it to heat sufficiently for searing. Season your food, and monitor closely during cooking to avoid flare-ups from grease. Always refer to recipe guidelines for specific cooking times and temperatures.

### Convection Roasting  
For roasting, ensure the food is properly seated in the oven, and avoid overcrowding. The convection setting helps in evenly cooking the roast while catching grease effectively. 

### Cleaning  
Never use abrasive cleaners on the self-cleaning surfaces. High heat is used for the self-cleaning process, which requires caution. After cleaning, allow the oven to cool completely before handling, and always follow safety precautions.

**Self-Cleaning Feature**  
Before starting the self-cleaning cycle, ensure the oven is cool. This cycle typically lasts 2-3 hours and will lock the door during operation. Wait for the cleaning cycle to complete before opening the door, allowing it to cool down for safety.

### Starting the Delayed Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate the delayed self-clean cycle, use the *Clean* function. Note that the self-cleaning operation will start and shut off automatically, depending on the clock settings. Ensure the oven door is closed. Press the *HR* button to set the desired duration for self-cleaning. 

### General Cleaning Procedures

Ensure the oven is turned off and cooled before cleaning. Address spills and heavy soiling promptly. Regular maintenance reduces the need for extensive cleaning later on. For painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces, use a cloth for cleaning and avoid abrasive cleaners, as they may scratch surfaces. Lightly apply cleaner to grease and wipe with a cloth or towel. Avoid using scouring pads or harsh chemicals, which may damage the finish. If necessary, use a specialized cleaner with a soft cloth, and then rinse thoroughly. 

### Care for Stainless Steel

For maintaining the appearance of stainless steel, refer to the cleaning section. To remove and replace the oven door, refer to instructions located at the front. Rotate the top of the door to detach it completely. Follow special care instructions to prevent scratching or damage.

### Important Service Information

Issues such as beeping controls or error codes (F1 through F10) can often be resolved by pressing *CANCEL*. If F8 is displayed, it indicates a self-cleaning issue. Ensure the oven's clock is connected properly, and if the oven doesn't operate, check the power supply and connection. For issues with the oven light, it may require a bulb replacement. 

### Addressing Self-Cleaning and Cooking Problems

If the self-clean cycle doesn’t operate correctly, follow the outlined procedures for troubleshooting. Excess smoke during broiling may indicate improper positioning of the meat or excess grease; ensure the oven vent is unblocked and clean. Common baking issues may arise from improper oven conditions or grease buildup, which should be addressed regularly.
