The cooler system operates within a temperature range of -2 to +8°C and features varying thicknesses with options for built-in or external assembly. There are four coolers designed for pre-charged cooling and constructed with expertise in assembly and installation. They employ advanced injection methods to enhance performance, utilizing high-density pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free from CFC and HCFC. The internal structure features rounded corners, and a fast-fit design is employed to ensure airtight seals using PVC. The units can accommodate ambient temperatures of up to +43°C and use refrigerants R404A, operating under high and low pressure conditions. 

If necessary, defrosting is facilitated through supplementary heated elements to minimize ice buildup. Internal lighting (rated IP54) is integrated, alongside an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting control, and thermostat functionality. The right-hinged door features smooth, rounded cam-lift hinges that ensure airtightness and high insulation efficiency, aiding in reducing operational costs. Compliance with HACCP standards is maintained, and additional shelving options are available.
