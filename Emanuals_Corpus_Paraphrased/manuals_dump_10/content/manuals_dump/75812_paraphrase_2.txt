The operation of the four-star fresh food compartment is influenced by several factors, particularly the thermostat settings. Adjust the thermostat to maintain an optimal temperature. Ensure that the thermostat is turned on (O) during use, and set it appropriately to keep fresh food chilled. The thermostat should generally be set to a level that allows for consistent cooling, especially during unusually warm weather. Avoid running the cooling system continuously, as this can lead to excessive thawing or inefficient cooling if set too high. 

To guarantee proper operation, verify that the thermostat light is functioning and that the switch is in the correct position. If food quality is compromised, check the thermostat setting, ensuring it is not below 16°C. In the event of issues, refer to the troubleshooting section and customer service information provided in this manual, which also includes details regarding thawing, defrosting, and maintenance. 

Please ensure you follow these guidelines for optimal performance from your fresh food compartment.
