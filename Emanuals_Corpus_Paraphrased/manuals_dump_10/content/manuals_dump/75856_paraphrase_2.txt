### Technical Specifications and Guidelines for Food Storage

#### Dimensions and Capacity
This section outlines the specifications and capacity for storing food. Adhering to weekly food limits is essential for maintaining health and safety standards. Important parameters include gross capacity, net capacity, and total power consumption.

#### Food Storage Guidelines
Proper food management requires keeping cooked and raw items separate. Foods should be stored in airtight containers, preferably polythene, to maintain freshness. Cooked food should cool to a safe temperature before being stored, and temperature should be kept within designated limits (e.g., around 7°C to 22°C). It’s crucial not to leave food uncovered during storage.

#### Safety Measures
When thawing food, it should be done gradually to prevent bacterial growth. Clean all surfaces and utensils thoroughly to avoid cross-contamination. If using knives or cutting boards, ensure that they are sanitized before coming into contact with food.

#### Maintenance and Care
For maintenance, always unplug from the electricity supply before cleaning. It’s recommended to clean the interior with non-abrasive materials and avoid harsh detergents or chemicals that could damage surfaces. Adhere to servicing intervals specified within the warranty for optimal performance.

#### Warranty Conditions
The warranty covers workmanship and materials for a specified duration from the date of purchase, contingent upon proper use per the instructions. If any issues arise, they should be addressed promptly with Service Force.

#### Service and Support
For additional support or to purchase replacement parts, contact Service Force via the website or customer service line provided. Ensure that any service-related actions align with warranty conditions to maintain coverage rights.

In summary, adherence to these guidelines ensures optimal performance, food safety, and compliance with warranty conditions.
