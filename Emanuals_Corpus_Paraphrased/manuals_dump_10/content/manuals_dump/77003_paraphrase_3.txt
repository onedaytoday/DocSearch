The function is activated by holding down the Right button. When this is clicked, the corresponding function will be displayed electronically. Ensure power supply to the device is turned ON to guarantee functionality. For reference on connecting devices or understanding the OSD, please refer to P.24 and P.33.

### Setting Up and Connections

To set up, follow the specified instructions shown on the right. Press and secure the relevant buttons to ensure a complete lock. Rotate the head to connect the AC supply. Utilize DIP switches to configure necessary settings, as demonstrated in the diagrams. To change the output type, switch the DIP settings accordingly. The initial mode is NTSC for RGB output. If any deviation occurs, adjustments may be needed manually, and connected devices should be monitored closely. 

### Storing Settings

Once the LCD is mounted correctly, power it OFF, and ensure the head is positioned as indicated. Apply pressure to the release mechanism. The actions will illuminate the display.

### Operation Procedures

To initiate, turn ON the main switch. Verify functionality via the front LED indicators. If the switch is turned OFF immediately after activation, it will reset after a brief moment before turning ON again. Utilize the buttons [TELE] or [WIDE] to adjust view settings, while the wireless remote offers additional controls.

### Lighting Operation

To control the lamp, press the [LAMP] button on the front or the wireless remote to activate lighting. To turn OFF, use the same buttons. Ensure the head is correctly aligned for optimal focus adjustments.

### Various Functions

The device includes multiple functions such as 3-D capabilities. Pressing the relevant buttons will toggle operational states, allowing for adjustments like brightness, balance, and rotation.

### Input Selection

To select the input source, utilize designated buttons without reconnecting devices. The active input will be indicated on the front panel. The system supports a variety of resolution formats and polarity configurations.

### Conversion and Rotation

To change settings like polarity, use the [POSI/NEGA] button on either controller. The system will reflect the changes accordingly. To rotate images, the [IMAGE ROTATION] button allows for counterclockwise adjustments.

For comprehensive interaction with the OSD and device operations, reference respective pages in the manual as noted.

### System Control Overview

For wireless control, the following buttons are available: MONITOR OUTPUT, PAUSE, IRIS OPEN/CLOSE, RGB1, MAIN, F.A.M., RGB2, TELE, WIDE. Pressing the [PAUSE] button pauses front operations, and pressing it again resumes them. 

#### Image Adjustment

To adjust tone, including characters and backgrounds, use the [CONTRAST] button on the front panel. This enhances lighting and leads to a more dynamic contrast. 

The camera can be operated in AUTO or ONE-PUSH modes for white balance. Activating the [WHITE BALANCE] button ensures the white balance is fixed. The system also allows manual adjustments via the OSD while transitioning between AUTO settings.

#### Iris Control

Control brightness either manually or automatically by pressing the [OPEN] or [CLOSE] buttons. To return the iris to standard brightness, press the [IRIS NORMAL] button. Use the [AUTO/MANUAL] switch to toggle between modes, ensuring the brightness can be locked as necessary.

#### Autofocus Functionality

Press the [AF] button to initiate autofocus. Upon successful focusing, the function is released for continued operation. If the [FOCUS NEAR] or [FOCUS FAR] buttons are pressed, autofocus is canceled but can be resumed by manipulating the previous settings.

#### Memory Presets

Preset operations can be executed by saving changes via the [PRESET SET] button and selecting a memory number. To recall a preset, use the [PRESET CALL] button followed by the memory number. The selected configuration can also be saved for future use using the [IMAGE SET] function.

#### LCD Connection and Operation

To connect the LCD (LM-5011N), use the DC and VIDEO connections as indicated in the manual. The system additionally provides a Software CD-ROM for PC integration and operation with TWAIN-compatible software.

#### OSD Configuration

The On-Screen Display (OSD) can be toggled on/off, and various settings can be adjusted, including color modes (POSI/NEGA) and preset selections. Factory settings can also be restored through the OSD interface.

#### RS-232C Communication

For PC connectivity, use the RS-232C interface. Ensure proper connections are made to communicate effectively with the PC and execute commands as specified.

This overview encapsulates the functionalities and operational methods for efficient management of the system, retaining clarity on controls and processes for effective use.

**Format Specifications**

This document outlines the specifications for a 1-command/1-response format. The command begins with the Start of Text (STX) character and ends with the End of Text (ETX). If a NAK (Negative Acknowledgment) is received, it indicates an error in processing; if an ACK (Normal Acknowledgment) is received, it confirms successful receipt. The command, denoted in PC ASCII format, operates as follows:

- Command (PC) for ACK is transmitted in ASCII format corresponding to operation commands. 
- Specific commands include selections for Iris (AUTO: 31H, MANUAL: 32H), memory readings (from Memory1 to Memory8 using values 30H to 32H), and ROM specifications.
- Communication is via UART format with ASCII-transmitted function commands such as AF (NEAR), FO (FAR), ZO (TELE), etc.

The SPACE character [20H] must be transmitted as part of the command. If the connection via RS-232C with the PC is established correctly, it should return acknowledgment.

**Troubleshooting Tips**

If any abnormalities occur, check the following symptoms and corresponding solutions:

- Ensure all connections are secure; the device should not be disconnected from AC power.
- Check if the switch is turned ON. If the device turns OFF shortly after being switched ON, wait a few seconds before reactivating it.
- Verify that the focus isn’t set too high for the current mode (e.g., TELE or WIDE) that could trigger protection mechanisms.
- Confirm the correct video standard (PAL/NTSC). If using a PAL device with an NTSC signal, issues can arise.
- Resolve any interference or display issues by manually adjusting the settings or brightness based on suggestions from the manufacturer or authorized services.

**Specifications**
