For cleaning, it’s important to securely follow the instructions provided, ensuring the machine is properly maintained. Always perform regular cleaning and checks to avoid buildup, and be cautious when operating. If difficulties arise, troubleshooting steps are available to address issues like blocked hoses or incorrect settings.

Make sure to switch off the machine and disconnect the hoses when necessary. Any significant issues or repeated error signals should be addressed immediately, with attention to connections and parts that may need adjustment or replacement.

For proper installation, ensure the appliance is level and secured with the right screws, considering proximity to heat sources. Always ensure the appliance is earthed correctly and that the electrical supply meets safety regulations. 

Use appropriate water supply connections, avoiding over-tightening which could lead to leaks. Follow all safety precautions and instructions to prevent damage or hazards during operation. If in doubt, consult a trained professional for repairs or adjustments.

**Hose Installation Instructions:**

Ensure that the supplied inflow hose is securely attached. If you're using a hose from AEG Service Force, follow the provided instructions carefully—whether with or without the hose screw. Position the hose correctly according to the guidelines and tighten it firmly. The hose should be connected straight using the appropriate screw thread size (inches). Ensure that it is free of kinks or obstructions during operation.

The hose should be securely positioned and used as indicated in the instructions. Maintain an internal diameter of approximately the specified size, ensuring that it does not exceed the recommended height. The upright installation should allow free flow from the source to the top of the equipment, where it connects to AEG Service Force hoses.

Whenever using the hose, confirm that it's attached properly to avoid operational issues. The outlet hose height should be measured from the specified reference point, taking into consideration the required specifications outlined by AEG Service Force.
