**Chillers GN Overview**

Chillers are designed to cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly reducing the potential for bacterial growth during the chilling process. This capability enables safe food holding at +3°C. The chilling process can operate in various modes, such as Soft Chilling at 2°C and Standard Chilling at 20°C. The system features continuous cooling, as well as built-in defrosting mechanisms, ensuring efficient operation.

The display provides a countdown timer and operational information, including data related to HACCP compliance, particularly if an abnormal termination occurs. The chiller complies with NF regulations, optimizing performance for different food types.
