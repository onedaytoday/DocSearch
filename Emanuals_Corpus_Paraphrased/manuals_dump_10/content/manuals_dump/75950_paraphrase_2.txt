**SANTO KA Operating Instructions**

Dear Customer,

Please review these operating instructions thoroughly. They contain essential information regarding the operation of your appliance. Reference these instructions for understanding various functionalities and safety warnings presented throughout.

**Safety Alerts:**  
Read all warnings carefully, including those highlighted with a warning sign. These instructions provide supplementary information relevant to sound indications and technical terminologies, which can be found in the "Technical Terminology" section. 

**Operational Guidelines:**  
If you experience malfunctions, consult the “What to Do” section. For issues beyond your expertise, please reach out to AEG Service Force. 

**Appliance Setup:**  
Ensure your appliance is installed in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. The operating environment should not exceed the temperature range specified on the rating label (from SN to C to ST). Maintain sufficient clearance at the top and back of the appliance to prevent excessive frosting and ensure proper airflow.

**Electrical Requirements:**  
The appliance must be properly earthed. Refer to the rating plate for power specifications. Use appropriately colored wires for connections according to standard electrical codes.

**Functional Operations:**  
The appliance features an ON/OFF switch and a COOLMATIC function. The yellow indicator light signals function activation. Use the (WARMER) and (COLDER) buttons to adjust the temperature settings, with the desired temperature flashing to indicate selection. 

**Warning Notifications:**  
When the ALARM OFF button is pressed, an alert signal indicates that the set temperature has been reached. The COOLMATIC function will automatically adjust cooling based on food or bottle placements, and the light will signify operational status. 

For any maintenance or further inquiries, consult the relevant sections on Installation and Maintenance.

**Warning:** If the acoustic warning tone sounds, it indicates that the temperature is above the set level. To silence the warning tone, press the "ALARM OFF" button. The warning will deactivate when the door is closed. A flashing warning light and accompanying tone will alert you if the temperature exceeds a specified level (C). If necessary, food items can be rearranged; just remember to mute the warning using the "ALARM OFF" button. The light and tone will automatically turn off when the temperature drops below the set threshold.

**Turning Off the Appliance:** To power down the unit, use the ON/OFF switch. A countdown will show from a specified number to zero, at which point the appliance will shut off completely. Ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply when necessary. Follow proper guidelines to maintain the appliance and prevent issues like mold from incorrect door closure in your absence.

**Shelf Adjustments and Food Storage:** Adjust the shelves to accommodate items as needed. Position heavier items at the bottom and lighter ones at the top for optimal performance. Ensure bottles are securely placed, avoiding unnecessary obstructions. Maintain proper temperature (C) for different food types, checking with a thermometer as needed.

**Defrosting and Cleaning:** Disconnect from the electricity supply before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning products that are safe for appliance surfaces to avoid damage. Thoroughly clean to maintain efficiency and performance. 

**Service Information:** For any technical issues or breakdowns, contact the AEG Service Force for assistance. This equipment complies with relevant electrical safety and regulation standards (e.g., GSG, VBG, VDE). 

**Warranty Details:** AEG offers warranty coverage to the first purchaser for a specified duration, covering defects in materials and workmanship from unauthorized repairs. If the appliance is taken abroad, warranty coverage may vary based on the location.
