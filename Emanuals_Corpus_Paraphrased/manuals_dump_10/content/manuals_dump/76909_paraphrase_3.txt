For a smooth and accurate installation, it is essential to follow these straightforward instructions prior to starting. Ensure that your installation adheres to all relevant plumbing, electrical, and safety regulations. Refer to these instructions regarding the fountain setup. Grounding electrical equipment, such as telephones and computers, to water lines is standard practice, which may occur inside or outside the building. However, this grounding can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, resulting in electrolysis that imparts a metallic taste or elevates the metal content in the water. To prevent this, use the specified materials. Any drain fittings provided should be plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the plumbing system.

Installation Instructions: The wall should be prepped according to the location shown for rough-in, with water lines thoroughly flushed prior to connecting to the fountain's rear service line. Ensure the water supply is turned on and flushed. Securely tighten the connection using washers, and make sure the supply line to the fountain is insulated. The products are designed for a water supply not exceeding specified PSI limits. If the pressure is significantly outside of these parameters, adjust by turning the appropriate component clockwise or counter-clockwise as needed.

Troubleshooting and Maintenance Assembly: Verify the flow with either a round or wire gauge. Important: All servicing must be conducted by a qualified service technician. Note for installers: Refer to figure EDF14C, part numbers, and descriptions for additional guidance. For parts inquiries, please contact your local distributor or call Elkay Manufacturing Company in Oak Brook, IL. Recommended water supply and waste outlet locations are indicated, including details for securing the fountain to the wall.
