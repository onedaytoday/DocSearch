## OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

### DESCRIPTION AND CONSTRUCTION
The electrically heated tilting braising pans are designed for efficient browning and roasting. Features include a polished surface that supports various cooking methods such as steaming. The appliance integrates a state-of-the-art motor for precise cooking control.

---

### INITIAL OPERATION
Before the first use, thoroughly clean the appliance and preheat it to 320°F (160°C). It may require additional treatment for optimal performance, including lightly greasing the surface.

### STANDBY
Ensure the lid remains closed during heating to maintain temperature and efficiency. Do not remove the lid during this process.

### AUTOMATIC CONTROL
Follow the user manual for programming time and temperature settings. Activating the system involves adjusting the timer and temperature controls.

### TROUBLESHOOTING AND MAINTENANCE
Regular cleaning and servicing are essential for maintaining performance. Disconnect the appliance from power before starting any maintenance. If operational issues arise, refer to troubleshooting guidelines in the user manual.

### CONCLUSION
This manual outlines critical safety and operational procedures necessary for the effective use of electric tilting frying pans in commercial kitchens. Following these guidelines will ensure safe and efficient appliance performance.

The SOFT mode is typically deactivated, allowing for quick heating of food with high thermal conductivity to prevent burning. When the SOFT function is activated, the heating adjusts based on the type of food, ensuring it reaches the desired temperature without sticking. The display (AZ) shows the current time, while (AT) indicates the cooking duration. The switch (S) activates HACCP features optionally paired with THERMACAM for temperature analysis. The HACCP (C) light indicates status, while the cooking process is shown on displays (AZ) and (AD). 

To switch off cooking, the HACCP (C) indicator will also turn off. Users can follow operating instructions via buttons (T), (D), and (Z). If cooking needs to be interrupted, activating the (TT) switch will halt the heating process, and manual shutdown can be achieved with (DT) or (ZT).

The mechanical tilting feature allows for easy emptying when using the (H) switch (as an optional feature). Simply turn the switch (S) to switch functions. The outlet also swivels, providing flexibility. 

For cooking meats, start at 391°F (200°C) and then reduce to 230-320°F (110-160°C) for further cooking. White meat should be started at 392°F (200°C) and can be steamed at 284-320°F (140-160°C). Load food properly in the cooking space, keeping it about one inch below the front edge, ensuring proper heat distribution.

For cleaning, the unit should be cleaned periodically using a cloth or absorbent material after it is switched off and cooled. Remove any food residues and grease as needed. High-heat cleaning materials are recommended to maintain the unit's performance and safety. 

In case of technical issues, indicators will alert you through sound or visual signals. Reset using (Q) and check for specific E error codes for diagnosis. Use caution when cleaning to avoid malfunctions and follow all regulatory guidelines for commercial kitchen appliances.
