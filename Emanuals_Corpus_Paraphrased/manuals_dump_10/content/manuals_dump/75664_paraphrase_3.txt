The unit features assisted operation, optimized for performance and efficiency. Its construction is based on AISI standards, with height-adjustable base, top, and back sections, facilitating easy access and internal maintenance. The design allows for complete defrosting and thorough cleaning, with a rounded interior that simplifies the process (without obstruction). The unit incorporates +43Â°C forced cooling to ensure uniform temperature distribution, while high-density expanded polyurethane insulation, produced through cyclopentane injection, provides long-term thermal efficiency. The interior is compatible with GN self-closing systems, designed to enhance usability and accessibility. Recessed features promote convenience, and a microswitch activates when the door closes. It is equipped with optional CFC and HCFC-free refrigerants, meeting international standards and CE certification.
