This document outlines the washing instructions for various textiles, including white and colored sheets, tablecloths, household shirts, and specialized garments such as wool and synthetics. Temperature settings vary from 95°C for standard items to a cold wash at 30°C. The washing cycle includes options for synthetics, delicates, and wool, aiming to minimize creasing while providing effective cleaning.

For optimal usage, empty the unit and select the "Night" option for quiet operation. Manual input may be required for some operations, such as switching the machine off or selecting specific wash settings. It's important to disconnect from the electricity supply before servicing or cleaning the machine, which should be done regularly to prevent issues, such as clogs.

Detailed troubleshooting information is provided for errors signaled by indicator lights. For example, an E10 or E20 error suggests a problem with water supply or drainage, and users should clean the hoses or check the connections. Malfunctions related to dirt or debris should also be addressed immediately to ensure optimal performance.

Users are encouraged to regularly inspect the internal components and maintain clean hoses for efficient operation. Any clogs, particularly in the drainage system, should be removed to avoid further issues. The manual also advises on the proper handling of the washing machine to maintain its operational integrity.

Safety precautions should be taken when handling the emptying hose, especially in cold conditions, to prevent damage. The unit is designed for standard household use and should comply with local regulations regarding electrical safety and recycling.
