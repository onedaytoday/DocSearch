**Navisphere Utility Installation Guide**

This chapter outlines the installation process for the Admhost Utility, VSS, and the general features of Navisphere. The Admhost Utility is compatible with specific Microsoft platforms and requires an appropriate version of FLARE OE or higher. Always refer to the Release Notes for relevant operating details. 

If you have an existing version of the Navisphere Utility, verify the installed revision against the version on the CD included with your product. To start the installation:

1. Navigate to the "INSTALL PRODUCTS" section and select the Admhost utility alongside your target operating system.
2. Proceed by clicking "Next." The Customer Information dialog will appear.
3. Enter the required information and click "Next" again to select the destination folder. Choose a location, such as `Files\EMC\Navisphere Admhost`, and proceed to finalize the installation.
4. Complete the installation by removing the CD-ROM and confirming the installation directory for Navisphere.

The Admhost Utility handles various functions, including managing WWNs (World Wide Names) for data assignments and operations. Familiarize yourself with the command functions, such as admhost_activate, which will activate specific LUNs (Logical Unit Numbers) to ensure proper storage configuration.

To install the VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) alongside Navisphere, you’ll follow similar steps. Ensure that you have the CLI (Command Line Interface) set up correctly to connect to each SP (Storage Processor) via TCP/IP, enabling efficient management and operations. Ensure that the Navisphere CLI is installed properly and can interface with your system environment.

For additional details, consult the EMC Navisphere Command Interface (CLI) Reference for specific commands, options, and configurations related to the Admhost and VSS as used within your operational environment.

This version maintains the original meaning while ensuring clarity and technical accuracy.

This document pertains to the Navisphere Utility, including the Navisphere CLI and related procedures, which are intended for advanced users. The following sections provide detailed instructions on installation (refer to A-2) and removal (refer to A-6) of the Navisphere and Navisphere CLI.

The Navisphere Utility serves as a command interface for managing attached EMC products, allowing user input to facilitate operations. This guide focuses on procedures for installation and operation pertaining to various Navisphere products.

To install using the provided CD, navigate to the appropriate directory to find either `navi_storage_system_initialization` or `AX100_storage_system_initialization`. Execute `Navisphere_Initialization_Wizard.exe` or `Install_Navisphere_Initialization_Wizard.exe`, follow the prompts, and specify the desired installation location (A-3).

For command-line operations, ensure you provide the full path to the response and log files when executing commands, as indicated in section A-4. If you encounter existing installations, utilize the respective commands to remove or update configurations.

Advanced users should consult registry entries under **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE SOFTWARE > Microsoft CurrentVersion Uninstall** to find uninstallation strings pertinent to the Navisphere. Utilize the entry below for any required commands and configurations.

To execute uninstall commands effectively, reference the `InitUtilUninstallString` and suitable pathname formats, as provided in section A-6. Adjust the command with the exact paths to your response and log files to ensure correct execution.

In summary, this guide offers comprehensive instructions on installing, utilizing, and removing the Navisphere Utility and CLI while highlighting revision checks and operational prerequisites for advanced users.

The process of connecting to the CLI and utilizing the associated switches is outlined below. It describes the necessary specifications, including paths and options for existing installations and their corresponding directories. 

When incorporating the following commands, be aware of the specified file locations, such as `-f2C:\aLocalSafeDir\agentInst.log`, along with the effect of certain switches related to installation and uninstallation processes. 

To navigate the service or CLI, utilize the paths as designated in the registry, particularly focusing on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Uninstall\{249CF790-30CE-11D4-9A87-0060B0FB53A4}` for the UninstallString. This will direct you to the corresponding text string, indicating the uninstall path and parameters. 

During the uninstall process, it's important to include the response and log filenames, as shown in the command examples. The log file (`-f2C:\aLocalSafeDir\agentUninst.log`) captures the operation's details, and commands should be executed in the directory where the utility resides. 

Further, the advanced Navisphere interface and the steps involved in installation, modification, or removal of EMC products are detailed, emphasizing the need to select the appropriate executable from the installation medium.

Whether you are performing installations or modifications, ensure that the correct paths and parameters are employed, maintaining attention to the registry entries which document these processes. The commands provided specify how to proceed under various conditions, ensuring clarity in executing the required actions.

An A-30 response filename has been created at `fullpath\responsefilename`, and the associated log file can be found at `C:\aLocalSafeDir\cliUninst.log`, using the recorded script located at `E:\aSafeDir\cliUninst.iss`. This log file pertains to actions initiated from the Add/Remove Programs section. 

The documentation section A-31 covers the removal of Navisphere CLI installations and related EMC products, detailing the necessary utility locations and specifications. If displayed errors occur, they may involve memory issues or incorrect command usage, as outlined in Table A-1.

Navisphere CLI provides the command interface for operations involving attached devices. Commands are issued either interactively or through a command-line interface (CLI) and can specify parameters such as IP addresses or switches for the operations.

The software includes support for various operating systems, including Microsoft and AIX, and enables functionalities such as SAN management and Snapshot operations. Different RAID types are also referenced, along with FC-AL IDs for configuring storage tasks.

The infrastructure encompasses systems for communication and data handling, utilizing high-speed components and FLARE software for efficient RAID management. This setup allows interaction with the necessary services, leveraging the capabilities of the underlying hardware for optimal performance.

Overall, the NAVISEQ tool enables sophisticated data management and synchronization across multiple operational contexts while providing a user-friendly interface for managing RAID configurations and LUN assignments. Each Storage Processor (SP) is equipped with sufficient memory for temporary data caching to enhance read and write operations efficiently.
