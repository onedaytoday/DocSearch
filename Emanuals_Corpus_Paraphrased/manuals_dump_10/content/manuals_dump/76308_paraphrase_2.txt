**International Program Settings for Washing and Drying**

The washing machine has specific program settings designed for various textiles, including white and colored sheets, tablecloths, and household clothing. The recommended wash temperatures range from 30°C to 95°C, accommodating different material types, such as normal fabrics and synthetics. For heavily soiled items, prewash and high-temperature cycles are suggested. 

**Wool and Delicate Care**

Special care programs exist for wool and delicate fabrics, allowing for a handwash option, typically set at 30°C. Users can also select the Night mode feature for quieter operation while washing.

**Operation and Maintenance Guidelines**

To properly maintain the machine, disconnect it from the power supply before performing any cleaning or maintenance tasks. Regularly check and clean the filter to prevent blockages. If the machine shows error codes (like E10, E20, or E40), follow troubleshooting steps, including checking hoses and ensuring they are properly connected.

Ensure that the machine is positioned with the correct hose setup, maintaining appropriate heights for water drainage. The machine must have access to an adequate water supply and be properly earthed to ensure safety.
