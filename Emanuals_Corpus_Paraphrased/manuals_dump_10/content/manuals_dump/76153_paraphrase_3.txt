**Ownership and Maintenance**

**Safety Guidelines**
Adhere to the relevant safety regulations: BS.6172, BS.5440, BS.6891, BS.5482, and the specific Building Regulations for Scotland. Ensure that the cooker hood is installed at the recommended clearance height. If the unit overheats, turn off the power and let it cool down.

Check and replace the charcoal filter every three months or as needed. To remove and replace the charcoal filter, detach the grease filter and turn the charcoal filter counterclockwise.
