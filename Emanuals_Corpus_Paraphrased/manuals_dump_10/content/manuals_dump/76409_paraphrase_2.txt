### Laundry Care Guidance

When selecting cleaning products for laundry, ensure they are appropriate for the type of garments you're washing. Whites can be treated with non-biological detergents and bleach, while colors should avoid bleach as it may damage delicate fabrics. Special laundry bleaches are available for specific requirements. 

Traditional detergents, whether in powder or liquid form, should be measured according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically found on the packaging. Fabric conditioners can enhance softness and reduce static. When using washing machines, always follow the guidelines for load size and detergent amounts.

Refer to the washing symbols on clothing labels for specific instructions regarding bleaching, ironing, and tumble drying. It is essential to regularly clean your washing machine to maintain its performance and avoid residue buildup.

For maintenance, regularly inspect and clean the detergent drawer, filter, and emptying hose to prevent blockages. If issues arise, disconnect the machine from the power supply and follow safety procedures to address any problems without risking safety or damage to the appliance.

If you encounter an error with the machine, refer to the manual for troubleshooting steps or contact customer service. Remember to redistribute loads evenly in the drum to promote effective washing performance.

Here is a paraphrased version of the provided text:

Using the supplied screws and components, ensure the hoses are properly positioned at the back. If the hoses are compressed, adjust them accordingly by releasing the polythene. Make sure to align the base upright and secure it with screws as per the included instructions. The hoses should be installed to avoid any obstructions, and if you are connecting to existing plumbing, use the appropriate BSP thread. Consult a plumber or a plumbing merchant if modifications to the installation are necessary.

The hoses must comply with local authority and building regulations for water supply. They should be properly positioned to function effectively and permanently plumbed in. Use the U connector as specified in the guide and ensure that the hoses are installed so that the top section is maintained without any bends or kinks. 

When connecting to the outlet, ensure that the hose is secured and appropriately routed to allow for efficient drainage. Any connections must be tight to prevent leakage. Avoid installing near areas with loose or crumbly substances, and do not cover connections with carpeting, as this can lead to malfunction.

Caution: This appliance must be earthed. Make sure to switch off the electricity supply as indicated by the ratings labeled on the unit. Use only the specified ASTA (BS1363/A) fittings. For any wiring issues, the connections should follow the color coding: brown for live (L), blue for neutral (N), and green/yellow for earth (E). If servicing is required, always switch off the power supply to prevent any risk of electric shock.
