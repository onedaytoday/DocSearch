**IQ-Touch™ with Touch Interface**

The IQ-Touch™ utilizes a touch interface that responds to physical pressure. There are three settings: Water, Ice Cubes, and Crushed Ice. Activating these options activates corresponding indicators. Holding the button for three seconds increases the brightness of the indicator light. This feature is meant to enhance usability while preserving energy efficiency.

Manual activation can be done in a similar way by pressing the touch controls for three seconds, allowing the user to toggle various sounds based on preference. The sound notifications can be muted when the Warning feature is engaged or during factory reset procedures. 

**Shelf Configuration and Care**

To facilitate organization, the shelves can be adjusted easily. Each shelf has a mounting system that consists of screws and spacers. It’s essential to ensure these are secured properly; spacers should be tightened clockwise when adjusting the shelf position, and loosened counterclockwise for removal. 

The shelves are designed with Luxury-Design™ features to simplify both storage and cleaning. They can accommodate various food items and include built-in mechanisms for easy sliding.

**Perfect Temperature Control (PTD)**

The Perfect Temperature control is initialized when first powered on, with the default setting being OFF. To adjust the temperature settings for optimal food preservation, utilize the On/Off button. The temperature can be set to specific ranges, and selections are confirmed through the display. 

Take caution when using the Perfect Temperature system, as it is sensitive to specific washing methods and detergents. It is recommended to clean with a damp cloth.

**Ice and Water Dispensing System**

The water supply system should be connected correctly to avoid malfunction. Proper setup is crucial for maintaining a consistent supply of chilled water and ice. The built-in arm controls ice production and should be operated according to the manufacturer's guidelines. 

Regular maintenance, including flushing the system every few months, is advised to ensure optimal functionality. It is also important to be aware of the various operational sounds that may indicate system status.

**Final Notes**

Ensure any cleaning or maintenance is conducted with power off to avoid any hazards. Verify that all components are functioning correctly and avoid using inappropriate cleaning chemicals. Regular checks will maintain efficiency and prolong the life of the appliance. For further assistance, consult the user manual or the manufacturer’s website.

### Advanced Maintenance and Performance Specifications

The unit is certified by NSF International, a reputable not-for-profit health organization, and meets ANSI/NSF standards for performance reduction without disinfection. The Rated Capacity TM and recommended service specifications are essential for optimal operation. To initiate the PureAdvantage TM system, switch it on and allow the specified amounts to release from the housing. You should hear activation sounds from the front as the system operates, specifically a hissing or clicking during the defrost cycle. Allow three seconds for water release during this process.

### Food Storage Guidelines

To ensure food freshness, avoid overcrowding shelves, as it hampers cooling efficiency. Store meats securely, preferably on lower shelves, and always wrap foods tightly with airtight materials to prevent freezer burn. This applies especially to hard-to-freeze items. Maintain space for air circulation to optimize cooling.

### Normal Operating Sounds and Sights

You may hear typical sounds indicative of high-efficiency operation, such as air being forced through the system or mild hissing from the defrost heater. These sounds are normal. The clicking noise when turning the cooling on and off is also expected. Pay attention to any unusual sounds, as they may indicate a problem.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

To maintain the unit's appearance and prevent build-up, clean it regularly using recommended non-abrasive cleaners. Avoid using scouring pads or bleach products that could scratch surfaces. Ensure that electrical components are safely handled during cleaning, and make sure to turn off the power before proceeding. Clean both the interior and exterior surfaces thoroughly.

### Light Maintenance

Ensure light covers are secure and replace them as necessary. Caution is advised when handling light fixtures; wear protective gear if needed.

### Warranty Information

This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship for a specified period from the date of purchase. Coverage extends to products used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Limitations include damages caused by unauthorized service or misuse. The warranty does not cover incidental or consequential damages. Customers should refer to state laws for additional rights.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

If cooling performance is not satisfactory, check if the cooling is turned on, and ensure the appliance is properly connected to a power source. If the appliance shows a flashing display, this may indicate the need for service. Temperature anomalies can often be remedied by adjusting settings or allowing adequate time for temperatures to stabilize. If conditions persist, contacting customer service is advisable.

### Common Water/Moisture/Frost Correction for Walls

Water accumulation can occur on surfaces. It is important to ensure that the connection is secure and shows the appropriate CE mark. When the designated section is pressed while pressing three buttons, it should indicate LOC. If issues arise, it may be due to weather conditions that lead to frost and condensation buildup, resulting in increased moisture levels. To mitigate this, the internal components should be sufficiently covered to prevent water collection, especially in adverse weather.

For ice correction, verify that the water supply is appropriately connected to the household system. If there are restrictions in flow, it may prevent adequate water supply and could lead to incomplete ice formation. Ensure that items are cleared of excess ice, especially if they are hollow or contain food. The supply switch should be turned off for any necessary cleaning or adjustments, listening for click sounds that confirm proper seating.

### Ice and Water Supply Correction

Check that the water supply is not empty or closed off. Fluctuations in temperature can impact the system, leading to ice blockage. Confirm that the household water supply is effectively connected and that there are no clogs. If necessary, allow the system to thaw and clean frequently to maintain efficiency.

If the correction light is off, it may indicate that cleaning is required or that food is improperly placed. Ensure that food items are packed tightly and maintain a clean environment around the switch. Regular cleaning of lightly soiled items is essential to prevent further issues. Release the light switch located in the designated section and regularly clean the tracks to ensure proper functionality.
