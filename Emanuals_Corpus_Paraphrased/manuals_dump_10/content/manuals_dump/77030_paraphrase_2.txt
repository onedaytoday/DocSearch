### Connectors and Functions

- **PE**: Protective Earth
- **PR**: Power Reference
- **VP+**: Positive Input Voltage
- **VL**: Auxiliary AC
- **M3, M2, M1**: Phase Connections

To establish connections, ensure the PE terminal is linked to M1, M2, M3, and PE terminals. For optimal performance and immunity, particularly with highly shielded twisted pairs, utilize shielded cables. Proper grounding of the cable shield to the chassis is essential.

When connecting DC to VP+ and PR terminals, ensure that the VDC is isolated. Notably, it’s advisable to use shielded cables for the DC supply as well. Ensure the shield is connected to ground, and ground the DC supply and PE appropriately. The polarity of the DC should be established before application.
