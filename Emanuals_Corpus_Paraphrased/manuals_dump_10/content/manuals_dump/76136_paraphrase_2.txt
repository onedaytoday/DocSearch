**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**  
This appliance is intended solely for domestic cooking. To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or personal injury, adhere to the following instructions:

- If the appliance is inoperable or malfunctioning, ensure the service is turned off and disconnect the power supply.
- Install only in accordance with local fire and safety codes, including those from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).
- To mitigate the risk of grease fires, regularly clean the appliance, especially after cooking with high heat or greasy foods. 

**FIRE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**  
In case of a grease fire:
- Smother the flames with a suitable cover and turn off the heat source. Avoid burns and evacuate if necessary, calling the fire department instead of attempting to handle the fire unless you are equipped with a Class ABC fire extinguisher and know how to use it effectively.
- Do not use water on grease fires, and never attempt to move a flaming pan.

To further reduce the risk of fire, ensure all ductwork is properly installed and grounded. Grounding minimizes the chances of electric shock.

**INSTALLATION GUIDELINES**  
Carefully unwrap all parts, which include:
- Decorative assembly
- Mounting brackets and screws
- Grease filters
- Warranty information

For ductwork installations, use straight runs whenever possible to optimize performance. Maintain a minimum distance of one foot from the vent to cooking surfaces. Ensure that the electrical outlet is grounded to prevent shock hazards and that all connections conform to grounding instructions.

Installation height should be adjusted according to the specifics shown in the guidelines. Use appropriate mounting screws and anchors for stability. For ducted configurations, ensure all duct connections are sealed tight.

**GREASE FILTER MAINTENANCE**  
Clean grease filters regularly. If using a dishwasher, follow the specific instructions provided in the relevant section. Non-ducted models utilize charcoal filters, which also need periodic replacement.

When cleaning, use non-abrasive, non-scratching cloths and mild cleaners. Avoid using bleach or any harsh chemicals that could damage the finish. Regular maintenance will help ensure optimal performance and longevity of the appliance.

**Operation of the Dead-front Standby:**

To activate standby mode, press the light switch once, which turns the lights ON. Pressing it again sets the lights to a brighter setting, and pressing it a third time turns the lights OFF. To toggle between settings for the ON mode, you can adjust the brightness from medium-low to medium-high to high. Always ensure to set the switch to OFF when needed, especially while the system is active, indicated by the standby light. For grease filters, clean them as necessary and then press the switch for a few seconds. For the charcoal filter, similarly clean it and activate the switch again for roughly the same duration.

**Heat Sentry Operation**: 

The Heat Sentry thermostat automatically controls the blower based on the cooking temperature. If activated, the blower will switch ON to HIGH when needed. The Heat Sentry indicator will illuminate, signaling its activation. To silence the alarm tone, press the designated switch. Note that the thermostat will turn the blower OFF and can be managed using the appropriate switch located in the blower housing.

**Bulb Replacement**:

Before performing any operations, always disconnect the electricity supply. To remove the cover, carefully pry it offâ€”do not rotate it. WARNING: The bulb may be hot! Handle with caution using a lint-free cloth.
