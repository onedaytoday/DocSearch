**SLOW COOK**  
Utilize this function to prepare meals at low temperatures, using a slow cooker or Crock-Pot. This method prevents roasting food from becoming burnt. You can select either high (HI) or low (LO) settings to control cooking time, which may last several hours depending on the chosen setting. Ensure that food is completely thawed before cooking. It is essential to regularly check on food items during the process. Adjust the heat settings as needed to ensure proper cooking. For best results, use a food thermometer to check doneness. Preheating is required prior to cooking, and to activate, press the OVEN button, then select SLOW COOK followed by either HI or LO, and press START. To stop the cooking process, press CANCEL.

**DEHYDRATING**  
This mode applies heat evenly to dehydrated foods, maintaining temperatures between 100°F and 225°F, typically around 120°F. Recommendations: preheat the machine before placing food inside, considering the amount and type of items being dried. Activate the OVEN setting, then press DEHYDRATE and START for cooking. To stop the process, use the CANCEL option. The DEFROST mode safely thaws items like cakes or seafood without using heat. To activate, choose OVEN, then select DEFROST and press START. To discontinue, press CANCEL.

**BREAD PROOFING**  
Activate this setting to encourage yeast fermentation in dough, typically between 85°F and 100°F, with a target of 100°F. Preheat for the best results and allow the cavity to warm up adequately. To use, press OVEN, select BREAD PROOF, and hit START. To stop, press CANCEL.

### Sabbath Feature (For Use on Jewish Sabbath Holidays)

The Sabbath feature allows the oven to operate on the Sabbath with Bake mode. It indicates operation status through lights; ensure it's activated correctly. Once engaged, the oven will remain on for a 12-hour cycle. If the oven light illuminates during use, it signifies the feature is operational. If the light turns off unexpectedly, the user must manually reactivate it.

**Important Notes:**
It’s critical not to use any function besides Bake once the feature is activated. Only “Bake,” “Start,” and “Cancel” buttons will function properly after activation. To set the temperature to 350°F, press “Oven” to light the controls, then select “Bake.” The “Cook Duration” and instructions for timing should be referenced as needed. Press “Start” to initiate heating. The HI and LO indicators will appear, and both should be pressed for at least ten seconds.

### Sabbath Feature (Continued)

After initiating the cycle, press “Oven” to adjust to 425°F before pressing “Start” twice. The oven may need to be manually turned off if required through the “Cancel” function. To deactivate, press both HI and LO for a minimum of ten seconds. If the oven turns off automatically, it will return to the previous setting upon reactivation.

### Cleaning Precautions

Do not use the self-clean feature if the oven is in use. Allow it to cool before cleaning, and wear protective gear when necessary. Avoid cleaning agents that might damage surfaces around the self-cleaning oven.

### Instructions for Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate self-cleaning, ensure the oven is cool, close the door, and press “Oven” to select the cleaning mode. Choose from Light, Medium, or Heavy settings according to cleanliness requirements. Once activated, allow time for the cleaning cycle to complete. The “Door” light will flash during operation. Once finished, ensure the oven has cooled down before opening the door and canceling the cleaning if needed.

### General Cleaning Guidelines

For painted and decorative surfaces, clean spills and heavy debris promptly. Regular maintenance reduces the need for excessive cleaning later. Use non-abrasive cloths and cleaners approved for your oven’s finish to avoid scratches and damage.

### Care for Stainless Steel

Regular cleaning maintains the stainless steel’s appearance. Refer to specific cleaning instructions to prevent scratching or damage during maintenance.

### Light and Broiler Pan Care

Ensure the oven is cool before handling the light shield, which must remain in place during operation. Clean the broiler pan and surrounding areas to prevent grease buildup after cooking.

### Cooking Notes

Preheat the oven adequately for optimal performance, especially for baking cookies and cakes. Proper temperature and oven capacity will yield better results, avoiding issues like warping or uneven cooking.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

In case the oven does not operate properly or displays error codes, refer to the user manual for potential solutions. For authorized service or repairs, contact the service provider immediately as needed.

### Cleanliness After Self-Clean Cycle

If soil remains after the self-cleaning cycle, additional manual cleaning may be required. Ensure that any grease buildup is removed to maintain optimal oven performance.

By following these technical guidelines, users can effectively utilize their oven's features while ensuring safety and cleanliness.
