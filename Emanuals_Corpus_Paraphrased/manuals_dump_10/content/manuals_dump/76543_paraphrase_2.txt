- **Transportation**: When transporting the machine, follow proper procedures to avoid damage.

### Technical Specifications
- Ensure all components conform to EN safety standards for operation. Regularly verify operational efficiency and safety compliance. 

Failure to adhere to these guidelines can result in equipment damage or personal injury.

If required, adjust the component to align precisely with the upper section. Ensure the assembly is secure while turning the necessary parts. Tighten the appropriate fittings and verify that the assembly matches the specified guidelines outlined below. For optimal operation, adjust components as instructed, ensuring they align correctly.

When securing the hex head screws, rotate them clockwise. Conversely, to loosen them, turn counter-clockwise. Insert the M6 countersunk screw from above, connecting it to the table plate. Rotate the head screw clockwise to secure it, then counter-clockwise for the countersunk screw. 

Install the switch by attaching it with M8 screws to the front, ensuring all connections are secure, and the switch buttons are oriented correctly. 

Attach the suction hose to the chipcase and ensure proper connection as per the operational instructions. Use the specified screws and washers to align each component correctly, ensuring that the straightedge is positioned accurately.

For assembly, use M8 screws and serrated washers, tightening them at both the front and rear. Proceed carefully to avoid over-tightening, which could lead to incorrect assembly or damage.

Observe electrical safety standards, ensuring that the equipment is properly earthed and connected to three-phase outlets with protection against electric shock. Always check for proper rotation direction; incorrect connection may lead to hazardous operation. If the rotation is incorrect, disconnect immediately and rectify the setup.

For maintenance, ensure the machine is switched off before any servicing. Clean regularly to prevent buildup of debris or resin. Use the correct tools for adjustments, and be cautious of sharp parts during this process.

Finally, ensure all repairs and adjustments are handled by trained personnel to maintain safety standards.
