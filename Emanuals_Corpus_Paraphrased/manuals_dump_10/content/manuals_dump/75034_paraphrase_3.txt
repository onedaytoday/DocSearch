To utilize these features, turn the TIMER/WEIGHT control until the desired option is displayed. Press the START/+30 button to initiate cooking, and the indicator will flash and emit sounds during operation to signal progress. For defrosting, select options for meat, fish, or poultry, adjusting time as required. It is important to rearrange or cover food if necessary to ensure even heating and thorough defrosting.

Various cooking charts provide detailed instructions, including adjustments for different food types and cooking procedures. For instance, when preparing various proteins or vegetables, the cooking duration may vary based on weight and type. It’s essential to monitor the food and adjust as needed throughout the cooking process. Always follow safety guidelines for microwave use, including covering dishes appropriately and checking for even cooking in thicker items. Additionally, it is advisable to reduce cooking times when necessary to prevent overheating or burning.
