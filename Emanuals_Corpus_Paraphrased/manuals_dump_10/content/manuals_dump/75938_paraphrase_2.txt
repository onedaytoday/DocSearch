### SANTO KG Operating Instructions

**Customer Operations:**

Please refer to these operating instructions for essential information about your appliance. They contain important guidance for the user and specify functions that may require caution. This document includes supplementary information about safe operation and maintenance.

For technical explanations, refer to the "Technical Information" section. Should you encounter any malfunctions, consult the "Troubleshooting" area or contact AEG Service Force. You can reach AEG Customer Service at their Slough office via telephone.

**Appliance Setup and Maintenance:**

Ensure the appliance is properly installed in a well-ventilated area, avoiding direct sunlight and sources of heat. Maintain a clearance of at least a few centimeters around the appliance to prevent overheating.

Always prioritize safety by ensuring the appliance is properly earthed. Refer to the rating plate for electrical specifications and connect the wires correctly:

- Brown or red wire: Live (L)
- Blue or black wire: Neutral (N)
- Green/yellow wire: Earth (E)

**Warning: Electrical Hazard**

Never operate without appropriate electrical grounding, which poses the risk of serious electric shock. 

**User Instructions:**

- To prevent items from freezing or bursting, do not place liquids in glass containers in the freezer.
- Follow cleaning protocols and switch off the appliance before servicing. Only qualified personnel should execute maintenance.

**Operating States:**

Upon turning on the appliance, allow it to stabilize at the desired temperature. The ON/OFF indicator will show the status, and additional lights will indicate various operating modes:

- **COOLMATIC Function:** Enables quick cooling, managed by its specific button. 
- **FROSTMATIC Function:** Quick-freezes food; activated manually via its designated button.

To adjust temperatures, use the designated controls to cycle through warmer or colder settings. The display will show actual and desired temperatures.

**Remember:** Always monitor operational changes through the indicator lights, and when converting modes, expect a short adjustment period. Regular inspection of operation helps ensure efficiency.

For any operational concerns or if the appliance does not function as intended, refer back to the guide for troubleshooting instructions or consult AEG Customer Service directly.
