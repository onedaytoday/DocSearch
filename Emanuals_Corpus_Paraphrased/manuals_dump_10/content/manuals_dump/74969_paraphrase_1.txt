### Important Information About Cookware for Microwave Use

When using the microwave for cooking and reheating, choose items such as Corningware, heat-resistant microwave-safe plastics, microwave-safe plates, pottery, or stoneware. Avoid non-heat-resistant plastics and products not labeled as microwave-safe. Preheating is recommended when reheating food.

**Covering Foods**  
Use specific covers designed for microwave use to aid in cooking and reheating. Do NOT use items that may shield the food from heat or cause uneven cooking. Aim for a cover about one inch below the top of the microwave. For guidance, refer to the microwave's cookbook or consult manufacturer recommendations to ensure all cookware is microwave-safe.

**Microwave Overview**  
The microwave features a clear view window and a light that indicates when it’s operating. Ensure the door is securely closed, and use the touch controls to operate the light or turn off the turntable. The turntable rotates either clockwise or counterclockwise and should be cleaned regularly.

**Control Panel Instructions**  
To set the clock, touch CLEAR and then CLOCK. Follow prompts for A.M. or P.M. If the clock is set incorrectly, an "ERROR" message will appear. To restart, use the STOP/CLEAR button. To start cooking or reheating, select the appropriate time mode, including options for popcorn and fresh foods.

When cooking specific foods—like scrambled eggs, soup, or various meats and seafood—refer to the cooking chart for guidance on food amounts and preparation procedures. Ensure that ingredients are arranged properly to allow for even cooking; for example, cover foods slightly to ensure they heat thoroughly.

For dishes like chicken and rice, soup, or meatloaf, follow these steps closely:
- Combine ingredients and cover them before selecting the appropriate cooking mode, then press START.
- Make any necessary adjustments from the chart regarding cooking time and power settings.

### Sensor and Auto Modes
