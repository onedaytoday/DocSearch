### Troubleshooting and Maintenance Guide

**Preventive Measures and Oversights**  
To avoid simple mistakes during operation, please follow these guidelines. When the E10 is activated alongside the E20 and E40 models, an acoustic signal will sound every few seconds. Ensure the service door is securely closed and the installation is performed correctly. 

**Cleaning and Inspection**  
If service is required, it’s essential to check that the hoses are properly connected and free of blockages. In the event of poor performance, inspect the E20 and E40 hoses for clogs and clean as necessary. If immediate cleaning is needed, ensure the correct options are selected on the machine. 

Redistribute the items within the drum if they have settled unevenly, as this can impact performance. Ensure the hoses are fastened securely to facilitate effective emptying. If problems persist, consider using stubborn stain treatments or adjusting selected settings accordingly.

**Monitoring Machine Status**  
The display will indicate various statuses, including alerts for doors left open or unbalanced loads. Regularly check that the machine is properly distributed and that the service force is functional.

**Service and Technical Support**  
For service inquiries or technical support, please contact your service provider. Ensure you have details regarding your water supply (minimum pressure specifications) and detergent types (e.g., ECO, synthetics, wool). The referenced temperature for washing should remain within recommended limits, typically not exceeding 60°C.

**Hose Management and Positioning**  
Ensure hoses are effectively routed without obstruction. Position the machine so that the hoses do not come into contact with heat sources or are impeded. If extending the hose, ensure compatibility with water-stop features to prevent leaks.

If a permanent installation is necessary, connect to the supplied U-bend. The internal structure should accommodate hoses without kinking or excessive length. Should you need modifications, consult with a professional service for correct installation.

**Electrical Safety Warning**  
This appliance must be earthed. Adhere to safety regulations during installation, ensuring the colored wires are properly connected to the appropriate terminals. The earth wire should be connected to the terminal marked with the earth symbol, and the connections for live and neutral should follow color coding standards.
