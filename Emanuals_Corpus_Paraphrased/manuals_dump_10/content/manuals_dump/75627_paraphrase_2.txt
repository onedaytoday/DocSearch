**Warning Notes**

- **DANGER**: Indicates risk of serious injury or death. 
- **WARNING**: Indicates potential hazards.
- **CAUTION**: Advises on minor risks.

**Child Safety Warning**: Ensure that the appliance is securely powered off and disconnected from electricity to prevent entrapment hazards for children.

For installation and operation, compliance with safety standards is crucial. It is essential to ensure proper airflow and prevent obstructions that may cause malfunction.

**Installation Guidelines**

The unit must be installed at least one inch away from walls to ensure proper function and to accommodate mounting requirements. Only use specified mounting screws and ensure compatibility with existing materials. 

**Electrical Requirements**

The appliance requires a grounded 15A electrical outlet. Ensure proper GFI protection is in place to prevent electric shock hazards.

**Starting the Appliance**

Upon unboxing, the appliance may already be in the ON position. To operate it, press and hold the ON/OFF button for three seconds. Secure the bottle tightly and allow it to stabilize for a few hours before initial use. 

The internal thermometer should be monitored for optimal performance, avoiding direct exposure to sunlight or heat sources. 

**Sound Notifications and Controls**

Sound notifications can be adjusted or muted by pressing designated buttons. Use the control panel to monitor settings and notifications efficiently.

**Cleaning Guidelines**

For maintenance, avoid abrasive materials and unauthorized cleaning agents. Use recommended stainless steel cleaners and avoid chlorine-based products. Regular cleaning using a non-abrasive cloth will prolong the appliance's lifespan.

If issues arise, consult the **Troubleshooting section** first. If necessary, seek professional service. Always ensure the unit is disconnected from power before servicing.
