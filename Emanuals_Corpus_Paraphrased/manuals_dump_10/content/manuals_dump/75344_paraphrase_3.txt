### Conclusion

For successful results, adhere to cooking recommendations and verify all settings before use. The internal cooling and automatic features enhance safety and efficiency, making meal preparation seamless.

### Cooking Instructions and Tips

To achieve optimal results when cooking, it is essential to preheat the oven and arrange food properly on the shelves. Place the food centrally on the shelves to ensure even cooking, and keep in mind the shelf count from the top down. Adjust the cooking time as needed based on the thickness of the food and follow the recommended cooking chart for guidance on temperature and duration.

When using enamelware or heavy cookware, these materials can enhance browning. For best results, avoid overcrowding the oven, allowing for heat circulation around dishes, which also aids in browning. Regularly check that food is turned as required during cooking to promote uniform heating.

### Defrosting Guidelines

Defrosting should be conducted at cooler temperatures to ensure safety, especially for items like thin cuts of meat. It is crucial to cook food immediately after it has been defrosted to prevent bacterial growth.

### Troubleshooting and Maintenance

If there are issues with the appliance, allow it to cool for a few hours and ensure that all operations are followed as per the guidelines. If problems persist, check the electrical supply and connections. Ensure all components are correctly in place to avoid mechanical malfunctions.
