**EDFP210FPC EDFP217FPC Installation Instructions**

For a smooth and correct installation, please read these straightforward guidelines before beginning. Ensure your setup complies with plumbing, electrical, and other relevant codes. This document serves as the reference for the fountain installation. 

The LKFRB1 component, which is responsible for heating, is included in this shipment. Note that grounding electrical equipment (e.g., telephones, computers) to water lines is standard practice. Grounding may occur inside or outside the building and can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain. This feedback may create electrolytic reactions, resulting in a metallic taste or elevated metal levels in the water. To prevent these issues, use the recommended materials. Any drain fittings installed should be made of plastic to maintain electrical isolation between the fountain and the buildingâ€™s plumbing system.

**Attention Installers:** All service must be performed by an authorized technician. 

**Mounting Bolt and Access Hole Layout**

Refer to figures 97565C for the layout of mounting bolts and access holes for EDFP210FP, EDFP214FP, and EDFP217FP. Be sure to verify that the wall is appropriately prepared to accommodate the fountain as outlined according to ANSI A117.1 and ADA guidelines.

**Rough-In Drawings**

Ensure that the wall can accommodate the indicated mounting locations and that the plumbing and electrical systems align with the guidelines provided. Tighten all screws securely and follow the instructions for attaching covers.

**Cable Adjustment**

When adjusting the hose for the heated installation (C) or higher, ensure it is mounted according to specifications, allowing for proper function. If adjustments are needed for the operating cable, ensure it is free of tension to facilitate operation.

**Water Supply Connections**

Utilize O.D. unplated copper tubing to connect to the cold water supply. Quick-connect fittings allow for straightforward attachment and release, just push in the collet to attach, and for release, push the tube in before pulling it out to ensure easy disconnection.

**Parts List**
