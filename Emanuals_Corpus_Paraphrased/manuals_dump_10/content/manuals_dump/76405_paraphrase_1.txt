### Immediate Actions to Address Hose Issues

If you encounter unsatisfactory performance from the hose, it may be clogged. For a proper solution, consider cleaning the hose or choosing specific options to address any selected phases. If the hose has become overly worn or is not functioning well, assess whether it needs redistribution or if it's simply underutilized.

To facilitate cleaning, ensure the hose is emptied and securely connected. If another hose is available, determine whether it could be used as a substitute. Increase the effectiveness of stubborn residues by utilizing appropriate cleaning products. 

The system may display an EF0 error indicating a need for immediate attention. Select the appropriate options to redistribute materials within the system. If distribution issues occur, it can be beneficial to evaluate the type of motor interactions involved. This adjustment can enhance efficiency without compromising overall performance.

### Technical Service Information

In the event that service is required, the technical support number for purchases and inquiries should be utilized. Ensure water supply specifications comply, including height and safety measures.

Refer to the chart for guidance on washing programs, including temperatures suitable for different fabric types, as well as compliance with EEC standards.

### Hose Maintenance and Positioning

When handling hoses, ensure they are unscrewed properly to avoid damage. Position the hoses carefully to prevent kinks or blockages. Mispositioning can lead to breakdowns; therefore, check that hoses are adequately secured and that threads are tightened. Compliance with local building regulations is crucial.

In cases where additional length is required, consider purchasing hoses equipped with water-stop features to prevent leaks. If hoses are permanently plumbed in, follow the provided installation instructions diligently.
