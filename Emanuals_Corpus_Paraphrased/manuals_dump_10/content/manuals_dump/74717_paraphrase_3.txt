## Important Safety Instructions
To ensure user safety, it’s essential to adhere to the guidelines presented in this manual. The appliance is heavy and should be handled with care. It must be operated within specified limits and should not be exposed to heat sources. Ensure the back of the appliance is unobstructed. Always allow it to stand for specified hours after moving before connecting to the power supply. 

Keep the appliance away from flammable materials, and be cautious of suffocation hazards with children present. Only qualified technicians should service or recharge the appliance to maintain its cooling capabilities and safety standards. Avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight or heat sources. For safety, do not operate without proper installation.

## Description of the Appliance
The appliance consists of compartments for fresh food storage.

## Operation
### Thermostat Functionality
- The yellow warning light activates when the thermostat is set to -16°C.
- If switched off, the thermostat will revert to the previous temperature setting.
- For optimal food storage, set the thermostat to the intermediate position (-18°C). 

Monitor food temperature closely, especially if the warning light (red) is illuminated, indicating that food may be warmer than -12°C. To ensure proper freezing of fresh food, avoid blocking air vents and keep fresh food at the top of the compartment. Once freezing is complete, the yellow light can be manually turned off after several hours.

### Food Storage Recommendations
To maintain food quality:
- Regularly check that food is appropriately packaged to prevent freezer burn.
- Consider how long food can be stored, based on the type of item and whether it has been pre-cooked.
- Thaw food cautiously to preserve quality, avoiding rapid temperature changes.

## Normal Sounds
You may notice typical sounds related to the compressor and fan operation, such as whirring or clicking, from the thermostat.

## Defrosting
Regularly check for frost buildup; if it exceeds a specified thickness, initiate defrosting.
To defrost:
1. Switch off the appliance.
2. Place layers of newspaper in the compartment.
3. Allow for complete defrosting before turning the thermostat back to the operating temperature (-18°C).

## Maintenance and Cleaning
Before cleaning, always disconnect from the electricity supply. Use only mild cleaning agents and avoid abrasive materials that can damage surfaces. Clean the exterior and any removable parts as necessary. Always ensure the appliance is off before performing any maintenance.

## Troubleshooting
If issues arise:
- Verify that the thermostat is properly set.
- Check for frost buildup or obstructions that may be causing operational problems.
- Contact an authorized service technician if problems persist. For further assistance, consult your service provider or official helpline regarding any specific symptoms or malfunctions.

For additional guidance, please refer to your appliance manual or contact customer support.

### INSTALLATION

Position the unit in a way that allows for optimal performance, ensuring it is placed in an environment where temperatures are below 10°C (50°F) or above 32°C (90°F). Avoid direct exposure to heat or sunlight. Ensure there is sufficient airflow around the back and top of the appliance. Maintain a clearance at the top and sides as specified.

For installation, gently tilt the unit backward while ensuring a minimum gap of 2 inches from the top to allow for proper ventilation. Remove the top by unscrewing it from the hinge, then detach the feet if required. Be cautious with the positioning of screws during assembly to avoid any complications. Confirm that the unit is evenly leveled for efficient operation.
