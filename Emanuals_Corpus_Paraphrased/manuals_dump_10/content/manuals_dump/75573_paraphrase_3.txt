The refrigeration unit features coolers operating at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C, designed with adequate thickness and equipped with built-in pre-charged cooling systems. These units are constructed with an emphasis on assembly ease and installation knowledge, incorporating new injection technology to enhance performance. They utilize high-density pre-painted polyurethane insulation and are free from CFC and HCFC. The design includes rounded corners for improved safety.

A fast-fit centering mechanism enables convenient installation of airtight PVC components, suitable for varying ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) and compatible with refrigerants such as R404A. In addition, the units are equipped with efficient defrosting systems that utilize heated elements to minimize defrosting times and overall energy consumption.

Internal lighting (rated IP54) is included and operated via an ON/OFF switch. Functional components such as a thermostat allow for precise temperature control. The door is designed with a right-hinge and features a smooth, rounded, airtight seal, optimizing insulation to improve operational efficiency while ensuring compliance with HACCP regulations.
