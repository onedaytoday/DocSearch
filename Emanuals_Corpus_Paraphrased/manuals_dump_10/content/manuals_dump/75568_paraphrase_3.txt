### Cooking Guidelines for Baking and Roasting

Ensure the oven is preheated before baking cookies, breads, and cakes, or when roasting meat. It’s important to avoid overcrowding to allow proper heat circulation. If preheating is not completed, cooking may occur too quickly or at incorrect temperatures, leading to uneven results or warping of dishes. Follow the specific temperature adjustments based on the food you’re cooking, ensuring they are not set higher than recommended (usually no more than 25°F/12°C above). Always adhere to clearance guidelines for optimal cooking.

### Cleaning Instructions

Always turn off and allow the appliance to cool before cleaning. Address spills and heavy soiling promptly, as regular maintenance minimizes the need for intensive cleaning later. Use a clean cloth tailored for the surface type, and avoid abrasive cleaners that could damage the finish. Never immerse heating elements in water, and refer to the cleaning guidelines before washing bowls or racks.

For stubborn, burnt-on residue, a specialized cleaner may be required, but be careful to prevent scratching surfaces. When using self-cleaning features, ensure to follow all safety precautions, including cooling down appropriately and not mixing with other chemicals.

### Safety and Maintenance

Keep the oven clean, especially the self-cleaning sections, and monitor for any operational sounds or issues. Regularly check that all components are functional and do not operate if repairs are needed. This appliance may require servicing if there are issues indicated by malfunctions.

### Common Issues and Solutions

If you observe lights flickering or inconsistent performance, consult the troubleshooting guide for potential solutions. Verify the installation and ensure that your cookware is compatible with the appliance. Maintain appropriate distances from other surfaces and check for manufacturer guidelines regarding cookware.

By adhering to these protocols, both cooking and cleaning will be efficient, safe, and effective, preserving the life and functionality of the appliance.

### Occurrence, Possible Causes, and Solutions

When using the appliance, issues may arise during operation or when self-cleaning. Common problems can result from the transportation of the appliance or improper handling, leading to scratches or damage. 

To ensure optimal performance, follow these guidelines:

1. **Preheat Properly**: Allow the appliance to preheat adequately before cooking to achieve the best results.
2. **Manage Grease**: Regularly clean the appliance to prevent the buildup of grease, which can affect self-cleaning efficiency. If needed, reposition food items to maintain proper clearance and avoid overheating.
