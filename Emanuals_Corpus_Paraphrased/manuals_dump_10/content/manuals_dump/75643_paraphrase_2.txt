**Chillers GN Overview**

The GN Chillers are designed to rapidly chill cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively minimizing bacterial growth. The chilling process allows food to be maintained at +3°C for safe storage. 

**Operating Modes**
Chillers feature various operating modes, including Soft Chilling (at 2°C) and standard Chilling (at 20°C). The ARTE system prompts continuous cooling during food insertion and includes built-in UV capabilities (available as an accessory), as well as defrosting functionality. The units provide countdown displays and operational service information, including HACCP data, even in the event of abnormal terminations.

**Performance**
These chillers efficiently lower temperatures from +90°C to +3°C, accommodating different types of food and varying chilling capacities.

**Construction and Finishing**
Built with thick AISI-insulated panels that are HCFC-free, these chillers feature rounded corners and an IP20 protection rating, enhancing ease of cleaning.
