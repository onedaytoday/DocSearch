**Chillers GN Overview**

Chillers are designed to cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively minimizing bacterial growth during this process. They maintain food at +3°C without compromising shelf life and provide the ability to hold food efficiently. 

**Operating Modes**

Chilling modes include Soft Chilling (2°C) and standard Chilling (20°C). The ARTE feature ensures food is consistently cooled to +3°C. The chiller operates in accordance with NF and UK regulations and includes built-in UV capabilities as an optional accessory. It also features a defrosting function and displays information such as countdowns and service alerts (P1 P2), which log data relevant to HACCP compliance and abnormal terminations.

**Performance**

The chiller effectively reduces food temperature from +90°C to +3°C, adhering to NF regulations regarding chilling methodologies.

**Construction and Design**

The unit is constructed from AISI materials with high-density polyurethane insulation that is HCFC-free. It complies with ISO standards and is built with rounded corners and IP20 protection for ease of cleaning. The thermostatic controls are heated, enhancing performance.
