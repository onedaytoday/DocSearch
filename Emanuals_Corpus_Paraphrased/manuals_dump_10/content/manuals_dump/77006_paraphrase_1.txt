This paraphrased version retains the original meaning while presenting the information in a clear and technical manner.

### Mouse and OSD Interaction

To navigate the on-screen display (OSD), you can use the mouse. Clicking the mouse or scrolling the wheel enables interaction with the OSD. To clear the OSD, simply click the wheel again. The OSD can be viewed or modified when displayed. If another device is connected, the supply will still be operational; however, guaranteed functionality may vary. For reference, consult the user manual sections on OSD (P.18) and further instructions (P.27).

### Unit Installation

Install the VB-1000 UL mounting unit, which should be compatible with the included HV-C1000XG power supply. Switch the unit on. Ensure the power is off when making connections, as proper focus on projected images may require adequate lighting. Adjust using the DIP switches for optimal performance; settings are predefined at the factory. Proper connections must be maintained, using the correct RGB output configuration.

### Operation Procedures

To operate the wireless unit, press the [POWER] button to turn on the LED indicator. If the unit turns off immediately, wait a moment before attempting to power it on again. Stability in lamp power is expected after a short delay. Use the wireless remote buttons to adjust features such as zoom (ZOOMTELE and ZOOMWIDE) and focus (FOCUSN/F). For auto-focus, use the [AF] button, and to turn off, press the [POWER] button again.

### Various Functions

Information about lighting can be accessed through the remote. Pressing the [LAMP] button controls lamp status. Additional adjustments can be made using the zoom functions. Use the buttons for color selection, image rotation, and contrast settings. Refer to the user manual for detailed instructions on OSD operation (P.27).

### B&W and Contrast Adjustments

To toggle between color and black & white, press the [COLOR/B&W] button on the remote. Contrast can also be adjusted via the remote, which affects image clarity and tone. Any adjustments made while in pause mode will impact overall performance.

### F.A.M. and Iris Control

The F.A.M. function helps reduce image artifacts. Activate this feature using the corresponding button on the remote. For brightness control, the [IRIS] buttons can be utilized to adjust levels, returning to default after pressing [IRIS NORMAL]. Additional RS-232C commands may be available for manual iris adjustments.

For complete operational guidance, please refer to relevant sections of the user manual.

Here’s a technical paraphrase of the original text while maintaining its core meaning:

When the AUTO FOCUS function is activated via the wireless remote, it automatically initiates. Upon successful focusing, the AUTO FOCUS function is deactivated, resulting in a focused image (FOCUSFREE). If AUTO FOCUS encounters challenging conditions, such as bright backgrounds or reflective surfaces, users can switch to MANUAL FOCUS using buttons designated for adjusting focus distance, marked as [FOCUS NEAR] or [FOCUS FAR]. If the AUTO FOCUS operation is interrupted while using the ZOOM options ([ZOOM TELE] or [ZOOM WIDE]), the system will pause the focusing operation. For any subsequent AUTO FOCUS, the process will resume normally.

To adjust specific functions like IRIS or switch between COLOR/B&W options, the user can utilize the wireless remote, pressing the [PRESET SET] button to save configurations to the selected MEMORY NO. When turning off the device, the settings will remain in memory. To recall these settings, the user can press the [PRESET CALL] button, followed by the corresponding MEMORY NO.

For memory-related operations, the user can store an image by pressing the [IMAGE SET] button and selecting a MEMORY NO. The image can be recalled later by pressing the [IMAGE CALL] button. Additionally, software for managing graphics can be accessed via the provided Software CD-ROM, which includes PC software and TWAIN drivers.

The On-Screen Display (OSD) provides operational feedback and can be accessed by pressing the [MENU] button on the wireless remote. Users can navigate the OSD using the ARROW buttons and execute functions as needed. The OSD will automatically cancel when the [MENU] button is pressed again.

Furthermore, features allow for the adjustment of white references and color settings, with options to toggle between static/moving imagery and automatic adjustments. Detailed control over the device’s settings can be restored to factory defaults if necessary.

For RS-232C connections, configurations are outlined for linking to a PC. Correct setup and acknowledgment procedures are needed for proper communication between devices. Command operations can be executed with specified ASCII codes for various functions, including AUTO, MANUAL, F.A.M., and more.

Lastly, to replace the lamp, ensure the device is powered down and cooled to prevent burns. Proper handling is crucial during the exchange process, including managing screws and cover mechanisms carefully to avoid damage. Always follow safety instructions to mitigate risks associated with bulb replacement.

### Troubleshooting Guidelines

**Symptoms and Confirmation Steps**: Check the following items. If abnormalities are detected, refer to your branch or office for appropriate solutions. 

- Ensure the TV is properly connected to power.
- Confirm the AC switch is turned ON.
- If the display shows only black or white, assess the following:
  - If the power is switched ON but then OFF immediately, try toggling the switch ON and OFF again after a few seconds.
  - Adjust the focus settings between WIDE and TELE as needed. 
  - If using AUTO FOCUS, troubleshoot focusing discrepancies.
- For wireless connections, verify the type setting is correct (e.g., PAL if required). Switch to "P" for compatibility.
- Check DIP Switch settings to ensure the [LAMP] function is enabled. If brightness issues occur, consider adjusting settings to minimize interference that may affect the TV or CCD, especially on LCD displays.
