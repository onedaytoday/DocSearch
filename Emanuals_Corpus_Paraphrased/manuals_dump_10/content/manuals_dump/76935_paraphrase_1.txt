To ensure a smooth and correct installation, PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY BEFORE BEGINNING. CONFIRM THAT YOUR INSTALLATION ADHERES TO RELEVANT PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL, AND OTHER APPLICABLE CODES. USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS A REFERENCE FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THE FOUNTAIN. GROUNDING ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT—INCLUDING TELEPHONES AND COMPUTERS—TO WATER LINES IS A COMMON PRACTICE. THIS GROUNDING MAY OCCUR WITHIN THE BUILDING OR EXTERNALLY. GROUNDING CAN LEAD TO ELECTRICAL FEEDBACK INTO THE FOUNTAIN, RESULTING IN ELECTROLYSIS, WHICH MAY CAUSE A METALLIC TASTE OR AN INCREASE IN METAL CONTENT IN THE WATER. THIS ISSUE CAN BE AVOIDED BY UTILIZING THE PROPER MATERIALS AS SPECIFIED. ANY DRAIN COMPONENTS SUPPLIED BY THE INSTALLER SHOULD BE MADE OF PLASTIC TO ISOLATE THE FOUNTAIN ELECTRICALLY FROM THE BUILDING’S PLUMBING SYSTEM. 

Refer to the O.D. tube water inlet for the cooler as indicated. ALL SERVICE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT BY AN AUTHORIZED SERVICE PERSON. INSTALLERS ARE ADVISED: CONNECT A PLASTIC UNPLATED COPPER TUBE TO THE COLD WATER SUPPLY SERVICE STOP (NOT INCLUDED) AS PER THE WATER FLOW DIRECTION INDICATED IN THE ECDFPW314C DIAGRAM. 

KEY GUIDANCE:
- Recommended water supply should be connected to the stubbed pipe from the wall shutoff (installed by others).
- Recommended position for waste outlet is through the O.D. drain opening furnished.

During installation:
- Ensure the wall is reinforced in designated shaded areas for mounting the fountain.
- Position the fountain appropriately as shown, using screws and washers to secure it tightly against the backing.
- NEVER SOLDER TUBES DIRECTLY INSERTED INTO THE STRAINER, AS THIS COULD DAMAGE THE O-RINGS. 

Check that supply pressure does not exceed PSIG, as this would void the warranty. If the supply pressure differs significantly from the factory-set PSI, adjustments should be made. Following these guidelines will ensure effective operation of the water cooler with lead-free materials. 

For a parts list, including components such as housing assemblies, screws, and mounting accessories, please refer to the provided figures or contact your local distributor or the Elkay Manufacturing Company. Lastly, when installing replacement bubblers and pedestals, ensure that nuts are tightened just enough to hold parts in position without over-tightening.
