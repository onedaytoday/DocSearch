Here's a more concise and technical paraphrase of your provided text while maintaining its meaning:

The SUPER ECO program optimizes efficiency for both cold and synthetic fabrics, with effective results at temperatures above 6°C. The Cotton Economy option is available for white and colored items, allowing for energy savings by operating without a prewash when temperatures are set to 40°C or higher. If this option is selected, it may reduce the cleaning performance slightly, as indicated.

3. The emptying hose should be inspected frequently; if clogged, disconnect and clear it as needed.
4. For emergency draining, follow the specified procedures.

**Troubleshooting:**

2. Ensure all components are positioned correctly and not obstructed to avoid malfunctions.
3. Activate the child safety lock if necessary to prevent unintended use.
