### Instructions for Operating the SANTO KA Refrigeration Unit

**Important Notice:**
These operating instructions contain critical information regarding the safe operation and maintenance of the appliance. Please ensure you refer to these guidelines for proper usage. Warnings and notes highlight important safety information for users.

**Technical Terminology & Operations:**
For detailed explanations of technical terms, refer to the "Technical Terminology" section. Additional operational guidance is also available for troubleshooting in the "What to Do If" section. If issues persist, please contact AEG Service Force or your local customer service at the provided contact number.

**Appliance Setup:**
Ensure that the appliance is positioned according to safety guidelines to prevent overheating or electrical hazards. The back of the unit must remain exposed to facilitate proper airflow and cooling. It is also advised that the appliance be left on for a specified duration after initial setup to stabilize temperatures.

**Safety Precautions:**
The appliance must be properly earthed to prevent electrical shock. Verify that the electrical supply matches the appliance's rating as indicated on the rating plate. The wires should be connected as per color coding: Earth (green/yellow), Neutral (blue), and Live (brown). Improper connections may lead to serious electrical hazards.

**Installation Instructions:**
During installation, ensure that all covers are securely attached and that there are no loose components. The appliance should have sufficient clearance from walls and other objects to ensure adequate ventilation. 

**COOLMATIC Functionality:**
This feature is designed to rapidly cool food and beverages. It is activated by pressing the COOLMATIC button, which will illuminate to indicate the function is active. The temperature will be adjusted automatically to reach the desired cooling level. To enhance cooling, users can press the (WARMER) or (COLDER) buttons to set their preferred temperature.

**Regular Maintenance:**
Cleaning should be carried out regularly to ensure optimal performance. Always switch off the appliance and unplug it before performing any cleaning or maintenance tasks. If the appliance is not functioning as expected, consult the troubleshooting guide or contact AEG Service Force for authorized service.

Refer to this manual for further details on operational guidelines, safety instructions, and maintenance procedures. For specific queries, the AEG service team is available for assistance.

**Warning**: A flashing light and audible alarm indicate an issue. If you rearrange food or adjust the temperature, turn off the warning sound by selecting "ALARM OFF." The alarm deactivates when the actual temperature falls below a preset level. To power off the unit, use the ON/OFF switch, which has a countdown feature that automatically shuts off the appliance once the timer reaches zero.

The warning light and sound will also be activated when the unit is warmer than 1 Â°C, or if the door is left ajar, potentially allowing spoilage or mold to develop. To prevent this, keep the door closed and check the internal temperature using a thermometer after an overnight period. 

For optimal storage, adjust shelves as needed, ensuring that items like groceries or bottles are positioned correctly to maximize space and airflow. When chilling beverages, ensure bottles are placed upright and adequately spaced, avoiding contact with the back wall.

**Normal Sounds**: You may notice whirring sounds or other operational noises from the cooler, which indicate normal functionality like the thermostat cycling. To maintain food freshness, cover items and avoid overcrowding to ensure proper air circulation, as items positioned too close can hinder cooling.

**Defrosting and Cleaning**: Always disconnect the appliance from the mains before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning agents and ensure that no bleach or abrasive products come into contact with the surfaces, as these can damage the protective coatings.

**Technical Terminology**: The appliance features a built-in cooling system that maintains food temperature by cycling air. Proper installation and ventilation are crucial for efficient operation.

**Warranty Information**: AEG provides a warranty for the original purchaser covering defects in materials and workmanship for a set period. Unauthorized repairs may void this warranty. Should you need service, contact AEG or the local service provider as listed.
