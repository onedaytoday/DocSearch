**Service XP XP Overview**

The Service XP series offers an efficient and flexible solution for cooking with the Convection Fry Top, featuring rounded corners for easy cleaning. The HP heating system ensures high productivity while delivering consistent results, allowing for versatile cooking options. This includes the ability to maintain temperature ranges from 120°C to 280°C for the 900XP model and 110°C to 270°C for the 700XP model.

The induction cooking top enhances service efficiency by rapidly activating heat when items are placed on it, minimizing pre-heating time and optimizing cooking operations.
