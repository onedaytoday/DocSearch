### Professional Ironing Solutions

At Professional Ironers, we prioritize the quality of our products and customer satisfaction. Our commitment to enhancing productivity and comfort is reflected in our diverse range of options tailored for various business needs, particularly in the healthcare sector. 

The Direct Ironer Advanced Machine Management System (DIAMMS) optimizes efficiency, ensuring perfect results without overheating. This system evenly distributes thermal heat throughout the ironing surface, protecting both the equipment and the fabric.

Our user-friendly interface provides real-time information and monitoring capabilities through the RABC* and CMIS** systems, simplifying the tracking and documentation of processes. This ensures a seamless operation, enhancing both the safety and productivity of your workplace, built to withstand high temperatures up to 200Â°C.

The Folding (FFS) Heating Service offers a cost-effective solution, allowing for automatic folding while you select from various heating options. This not only improves efficiency but also fosters a healthier work environment by utilizing thermal heating methods that minimize energy costs.

We provide tailored ironers to meet specific operational requirements, such as height adjustments and unique heating features for different fabric types. Our range includes options like Bed-type IB42310, IB42314, and IB42316, with steam and thermal functionalities available.
