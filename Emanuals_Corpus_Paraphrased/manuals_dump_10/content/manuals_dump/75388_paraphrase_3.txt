By adhering to these instructions, you can effectively and safely utilize the appliance. Always ensure the unit is cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's guidelines for longevity.

The cooking process is essential for achieving the correct consistency of dough and cake, which subsequently affects cooking duration. Dough must be prepared before placing it on one of the three cooking shelves. When cooking meat, aim for temperatures ranging from 200°C to 230°C to prevent overcooking, particularly for cuts that require high heat, while white meat is better suited for lower temperatures between 150°C and 175°C. It's important to monitor whether the meat should be turned during the cooking process based on its type and desired outcome. Once cooking is complete, this should maintain an optimal formation without overly increasing the roasting time or steam concentration.

Preheating is a necessary step before cooking, and various types of dishes, including cakes (such as whipped, shortbread, and fruit cakes) and foods like bread, pizza, and meat (such as whole fish and specific cuts), should be accommodated within these guidelines. 

For maintenance and cleaning, the appliance should be turned off and allowed to cool first. Avoid using bleach, scouring pads, or aggressive cleaning products; only non-stick safe cleaners should be used. If any parts become chipped or scratched, stop using the appliance to prevent safety hazards. 

For replacing light bulbs, ensure compatibility with specifications: 25 W, capable of withstanding 300°C, and type E14. If you encounter issues like malfunctioning lights or uneven cooking, check the settings, ensure everything is wired correctly, and consult troubleshooting tips provided in the manual.
