**Troubleshooting Issues with Your Service**

If your appliance is not functioning correctly, it may be due to high water temperature or a blocked hose. Ensure the hose is clean and not completely obstructed. The system operates continuously, and sounds such as ticking may indicate thermostat activity or issues with switches. If you notice unusual noises, verify that components are properly aligned. Inadequate water flow could stem from a high incoming pressure or a malfunctioning strainer.

If the cooling mechanism is not reaching the desired temperature, it may affect the preservation of food items. Distribute items evenly within the appliance for optimal airflow, and ensure all seals are clean and closed. If operational indicators are flashing, it may signal an overload or connection fault.

For assistance, contact Service Force through their website or telephone for further guidance. Ensure you have details about your purchase or service needs ready.
