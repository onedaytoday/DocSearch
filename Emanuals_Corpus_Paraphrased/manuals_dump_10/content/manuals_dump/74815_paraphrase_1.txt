Here is a paraphrased version of your text:

To deactivate the thermostat, you can either turn it off or disconnect it from the power supply. Make sure to defrost and clean the appliance thoroughly. It’s essential to properly defrost and care for the food storage sections. Store fresh food at temperatures around -18°C. Ensure that fresh food is within the storage capacity specified and try to maintain the recommended amount during storage. Allow cooked food to cool before placing it inside to avoid ice formation. 

Avoid storing items like bottles, as they may burst under pressure. When adding fresh food, the light indicator will turn on. Follow the appliance’s guidelines for storage times and ensure that food is stored tightly to prevent odor transfer between items. Limit the amount of different food types stored together to avoid cross-contamination.

For ice cube preparation, ensure the trays are suitable for the appliance and try not to place the trays near the heating elements. Regularly clean the frost buildup, as excessive frost can affect performance; typically, frost should be removed when it reaches a specific thickness.

Avoid using fear-based mechanical methods for defrosting, as these can pose health risks. Always switch off the appliance before cleaning to prevent electrical shock. Use appropriate cleaning products and cloths, maintaining cleanliness to ensure optimal performance of the appliance.

If any malfunctions occur, such as an illuminated warning light or temperature inconsistencies, consult the troubleshooting section of the manual. If issues persist, contact Service Force for assistance.

Follow EU regulations and standards for safety. Ensure that the appliance is correctly installed and maintained to maximize efficiency. The cooling system operates effectively by transferring heat away from stored food, so it’s crucial to manage food placement and avoid exposing the unit to heat sources. 

In summary, attentive care and proper handling of the appliance and its contents are vital for optimal functionality and safety.
