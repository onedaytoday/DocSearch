### Please Follow These Instructions

1. **Operating the Cooker**: Ensure the cooker is properly closed when in operation. Only use the cooker for its intended purpose, especially when cooking foods that require pressure, like cranberries or other vegetables. Allow the cooker to cool and release built-up pressure internally before opening. 

2. **Introduction to Precautions**: Thoroughly read the instructions prior to use. The Emerilware One Cooker operates with high heat, so familiarize yourself with safe cooking practices. Prior to cooking, ensure the cooker is clean and dry by following the cleaning instructions.

3. **Features**: The Emerilware One incorporates a Steam-Surround cooking technology that envelops food in steam while cooking, promoting healthier meals. It works well with various foods and spices.

4. **Cooking Process**: Start with high heat until the cooker reaches the appropriate temperature. Once steam releases, you might hear a whistling sound, indicating the cooking process is underway. 

5. **Safety Precautions**: When locking and unlocking the cooker, ensure it is completely cool. If pressure builds up and safety mechanisms are activated, switch off the heat and allow the cooker to cool before opening. 

6. **Food Preparation Tips**: Fill the cooker appropriately as stated in the manual, and always follow specific cooking instructions. Foods should be prepared according to the recommended times to prevent burning or undercooking.

7. **Cleaning Guidelines**: The non-stick interior is dishwasher safe, but avoid using sharp utensils or abrasive cleaners that can damage the coating. Clean the outside with a soft cloth immediately after use. Avoid prolonged exposure to high heat when empty, as this can lead to malfunction.

8. **Troubleshooting**: If you experience issues, check that the cooker is correctly assembled and that it's being used properly. Refer to customer service for assistance if problems persist.

9. **Warranty Information**: The Emerilware One is covered by a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for a specified period from the date of purchase. Retain your sales receipt and contact customer service for warranty claims.

10. **Customer Service**: For inquiries or warranty service, reach out to the Emerilware Customer Service team with your purchase details, and keep the warranty documentation handy.
