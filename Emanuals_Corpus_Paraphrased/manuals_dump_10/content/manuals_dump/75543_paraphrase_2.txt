**Owner's Guide for ESII Cleaning**

**Read and Retain These Instructions**

**Important Safety Instructions:**
These guidelines are crucial to ensure safe operation and maintenance of your electric range. Failure to comply with these instructions may result in severe injuries or property damage. 

**Installation:**
Ensure the appliance is installed correctly by a qualified technician in accordance with the National Electrical Code. Only authorized personnel should conduct repairs.

**Child Safety:**
Keep children away from the appliance during use. Burns can occur from the hot surfaces or items placed near the range.

**Fire Safety:**
Avoid flammable materials around the range, and use appropriate fire extinguishers for grease fires. Do not use wet potholders, as they can cause burns.

**Proper Use:**
Select heating elements that match the size of the cookware to improve efficiency. Ensure the range is not left unattended while in use.

**Cleaning:**
Regular cleaning of grease buildup is essential to prevent fire hazards. Follow manufacturer recommendations for specific cleaning products and techniques. For self-cleaning options, observe all safety instructions to avoid health risks.

**Oven Operation:**
Always arrange oven racks while the oven is cool to avoid burns. Use caution when handling hot dishes to prevent spills and accidents.

**Indicator Lights and Controls:**
Familiarize yourself with the control panel, including indicator lights for various cooking modes (e.g., self-clean, bake, preheat). 

**Note on Cooking Times:**
Understand how cooking times and temperatures may vary based on the type and amount of food being prepared. 

For comprehensive details and effective operation, always refer to the specific instructions outlined in this guide.

Here’s a paraphrase of the provided text with a focus on clarity and technical accuracy:

The built-in oven can operate within a temperature range of 170°F to 550°F (65°C to 287°C). To set the oven to "Normal," adjust the temperature dial. When you press the respective button, the oven will begin heating until the selected temperature is reached, at which point it will automatically turn off. To start, turn the dial, and then press the clock button to set the timer. For optimal cooking, especially with meat or poultry, ensure your items are fully thawed before cooking; they should not remain in the oven for more than one hour after cooking completion. 

The BAKE TIME and STOP TIME functions allow for precise cooking management, and it's essential to switch off the oven safely when you're done. If a fire occurs, do not use water; use a fire extinguisher instead. Always monitor cooking progress by turning the food periodically to ensure even cooking. 

Regarding self-cleaning, do not use any cleaning products that are not intended for self-cleaning ovens. Avoid forcing the door open while the self-cleaning cycle is active, as this could damage the locking mechanism or cause injury due to high temperatures. Once the cleaning cycle is complete and the oven has cooled adequately, you can safely handle and clean the oven door and gasket. 

When cleaning, always cool the oven completely before proceeding. For food residue or grease build-up, use a cloth; avoid abrasive cleaners to prevent scratches. Follow all manufacturer instructions and safety precautions when cleaning or maintaining your oven.

To clean the oven, first ensure it has cooled. You can use a soft cloth for external surfaces, while the interior may require more attention if heavily soiled. If the oven light needs replacing, turn off the power, remove the light cover following safety guidelines, and replace the bulb.

When handling removable components, such as racks or trays, ensure they are securely seated to prevent accidents. Use the provided cleaning chart for specific materials and areas, ensuring a thorough and safe cleaning process.

### Performance Guidelines for Self-Cleaning Oven

**Functionality Specifications:**
To initiate the self-cleaning function, ensure the oven is turned OFF. If the oven temperature seems too high or low, adjust it according to the specified parameters. The recommended range for adjustment is 35°F to 5°F. Adjustments should be made clockwise and are typically audible.

**Offset Adjustments:**
To increase the temperature, select the High (HI) option, or the Low (LO) option to decrease it. If the "OVEN" light is flashing while the "LOCK" light is also blinking, it indicates that a temperature offset is being applied. The lights will flash in response to every 5°F increment. About three flashes signify a 15°F adjustment, while a single flash indicates a return to factory settings at 0°F.

**Maintenance and Troubleshooting:**
For service needs, preventive care is advised to avoid excessive heat or improper appliance function. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for repairs and maintenance. Common service issues may arise from tightly packed cooking items or incorrect cookware, which can affect heating efficiency. Ensure your cookware is appropriate for the heating method being used.

**Warranties:**
This appliance comes with a full one-year warranty from the purchase date, covering normal usage. A limited warranty extends up to five years for certain parts, with specific exclusions applied. Consumers are responsible for service fees and any conditions resulting from improper installation or misuse.

**Authorized Servicers:**
Service must be performed by authorized personnel to ensure compliance with warranty standards. This warranty does not cover damages from third-party services or modifications.

**Important Considerations:**
This warranty applies strictly to household use and does not cover consequential damages or mishaps caused by improper use. Regulatory specifics and additional rights may vary by location; consult local guidelines for details.
