### Instruction A-6.2 Active

To enhance your home theater experience with products such as VCRs, it is essential to ensure proper sound directionality—this allows you to experience action sounds dynamically, as they should originate from the right sources. The use of amplifiers is fundamental for home theater sound systems, providing amplification for audio signals. 

In terms of spatial audio, the arrangement and placement of speakers, including surround sound components, are pivotal. Surround sound technology creates an immersive auditory experience with realistic sound effects, such as deep bass and other impactful audio elements. For optimal performance, ensure that all components, including rear surround boxes, are well-coordinated in relation to the primary viewing setup.

**Subwoofers and Setup:**

Immediately connect the active subwoofer to enhance sound output, particularly low-frequency bass. Ensure correct wiring; the cables should be linked to the appropriate inputs from the amplifier. Position the subwoofer thoughtfully—ideally not too close to walls or corners—to avoid acoustical issues that may distort sound quality.

Adjust the subwoofer's phase settings carefully, as this can influence the bass response and minimize sound cancellation. Choose a position that balances the bass output effectively within the room's acoustics.

Please refer to the following warnings and information about safe operation to avoid electric shock or malfunctions. It is a good practice to familiarize yourself with operational and servicing instructions included in the documentation.

**Troubleshooting:**

If the subwoofer does not produce sound despite being connected, verify that all connections are secure and that the power switch is in the 'On' position. In the event of persistent issues, consult service personnel as outlined in the troubleshooting guide.
