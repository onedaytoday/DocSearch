**Washer Locking Screw Assembly:** To connect the sawtooth head properly, align it according to the instructions. To release or stop the saw, set the F1 switch to STOP (I) and close the F2 switch. Ensure the C flow circulates through the assembly smoothly and without obstruction, allowing only authorized service personnel to maintain performance at optimal efficiency.

**Screw Adjustment:** For adjustments, turn the screw clockwise to engage the assembly, ensuring it rotates smoothly without restriction. Counterclockwise rotation will release it. The F series of switches (F1, F2, F3) controls the operation. After stopping (with F1), allow a few seconds before adjusting the throttle (ensure it is released).

**Protective Measures:** Regular maintenance, including cleaning the equipment (particularly the backpack and cord), is crucial for preventing overheating and ensuring the longevity of components. Greasy residue builds up over time and requires thorough cleaning every few months.

**Weight Distribution:** Properly distribute weight across the hips and shoulders for comfort during operation. Ensure adjustments allow the backpack to fit securely and accurately.

**Cutting Operations:** When performing cutting tasks, maintain a proper height and angle to avoid wear on the equipment. If the head becomes worn, reassemble as instructed and ensure it functions effectively. 

**Throttle Management:** To minimize wear and enhance efficiency, release the throttle when not in use, and avoid contact with the ground during operation. Ensure operational procedures are safely followed to reduce strain and prevent kickback.

**Troubleshooting:** For issues related to kickback or operational interruptions, avoid contacting the ground and follow the prescribed maintenance procedures. Engage only authorized personnel for repairs to avoid complications.

**Compliance Declaration:** The products BC011 and BC012 from E.O.P., Italy, comply with several directives, including 98/37/EEC and 93/68/EEC, ensuring they meet required standards for performance and safety. 

Through diligent maintenance and following operational guidelines, you can ensure optimal use and safety of the equipment.
