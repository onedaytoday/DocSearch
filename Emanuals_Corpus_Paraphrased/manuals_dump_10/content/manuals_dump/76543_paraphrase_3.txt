If needed, adjust the mechanism to align precisely with the top section. Ensure that all components are securely fastened. Tighten the relevant screws—specifically the M6 and M8 screws—using a clockwise motion as indicated, and follow the assembly guidelines below to confirm correct operation. 

For secure mounting, attach the switch using the specified head screws and washers, ensuring they fit snugly to maintain integrity. The suction hose should be connected to the chipcase as outlined in the "Operation" chapter. 

When aligning the straightedge, ensure it is precisely positioned according to the tooth placement for optimal performance. 

Before proceeding with electrical connections, verify that the power supply is adequately grounded and complies with specified ratings. Ensure connections are reliable to prevent issues such as incorrect rotation or electrical hazards. 

Always switch off the device when making adjustments or performing maintenance, and follow necessary safety procedures to mitigate risks associated with moving parts or debris. 

Use appropriate protective gear, especially hearing protection when using the equipment. For any repairs or maintenance beyond basic adjustments, consult the service guidelines and refer to qualified personnel, avoiding operation until all safety concerns are addressed. 

Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential to ensure proper functioning and longevity of the machine.
