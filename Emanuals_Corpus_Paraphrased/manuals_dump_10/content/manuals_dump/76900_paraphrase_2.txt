Recessed fountains and unplated water supplies should be connected as needed. Ensure thorough connection to the unplated cooler, which links to the building supply along with a shut-off valve. It’s important to remove any burrs before installation. **Note:** Do not solder tubes inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. Ensure the cooler is directly supplied according to specified phases. Proper grounding for devices like computers is essential to prevent electrolysis and interference, which can affect performance. It is crucial to electrically isolate the fountain from the building’s operational supply, ensuring there is adequate clearance for free movement.

Factory settings should maintain a temperature of 50°F, and components need regular cleaning with appropriate cleaners. Lubrication is necessary for the proper functioning of the water cooler, which should use lead-free materials. During installation, refer to the important start-up operation manual. 

For quick connect fittings, the tube is secured by simply pushing it in; to release it, push while pulling out.
