To protect food items, utilize protective covers made of materials like polythene. Food that has thawed should be consumed immediately if cooked, or discarded if completely defrosted. Alternatively, food can be cooked from its frozen state. Ensure that food items are used within a few months of purchase, and follow warranty guidelines for conditions related to workmanship. 

For optimal performance, adhere to guidelines regarding food storage. Ensure that meat and poultry are securely wrapped in airtight polythene. Foods should be adequately cleaned and ready for cooking without compromising thawing instructions. 

For any service inquiries, including repairs or replacements, please contact Service Force. This service also applies to products sold within the European Community (EC). 

When organizing the appliance’s shelves, ensure proper positioning as illustrated in the user manual. For additional support or inquiries, reach out to Customer Care at the specified address or telephone number listed below.

Normal operational sounds, such as clicks or whirrs from the thermostat, are typical and should not cause concern. Ensure that foods remain at the recommended temperature and that the refrigeration section is not overloaded to avoid improper cooling and frost buildup.

During maintenance or cleaning, power off the appliance before beginning. If frost reaches a certain thickness, it is essential to defrost appropriately. Clean the interior regularly and use only recommended materials to avoid damage to the appliance's surfaces.

To maintain performance, hoses should be inspected for obstruction, and cleaning should be done with caution to avoid residue buildup, particularly at the back of the appliance. It's vital to follow all cleaning protocols thoroughly while ensuring that the appliance remains plugged out during cleaning operations.

### Normal Sounds: Hints and Tips

When operating a freezer or refrigerator, you may hear certain sounds related to cooling. If these sounds indicate obstruction, it may signify an issue with food placement or airflow. Ensure food is arranged appropriately; unwrapped items can block airflow and lead to frost build-up. 

The thermostat may click as it regulates temperature and the machine cycles on and off. Ensure that the food, particularly items like ice cream or frozen meals, are kept in airtight packaging to avoid freezer burn. Regular checks on frost levels and maintaining the correct temperature are essential for optimal performance.

### Troubleshooting Issues with Food

For proper refrigeration:

- Foods should be sealed and organized correctly to allow for adequate airflow.
- A thermometer inside the appliance may help monitor temperature, which should be set around +5°C. 
- If cooling performance is affected, verify that the thermostat is functioning correctly and that there’s no clutter blocking airflow.

To help refrigerate effectively, cover food with protective plastic or similar materials. Continued operation of your appliance should adhere to the provided guidelines to prevent potential food spoilage and production of ice crystals.

### Warranty and Service Information

In case of persistent issues, consult the Service Force to discuss maintenance or replacement parts. Documentation including purchase information and service contacts can typically be found on the manufacturer’s website.

### Technical Specifications

Ensure that your appliance is positioned correctly for optimal functioning. Follow guidelines regarding voltage and power ratings, and monitor average daily electricity consumption. 

### Installation Guidelines

When installing a new appliance, ensure that it is positioned in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight. Allow space for airflow around the unit by keeping the back and sides clear of obstructions. 

For appliances with locks, secure them correctly to prevent accidents, especially with young children nearby. Always ensure that the unit is shut down properly when discarding an old appliance.
