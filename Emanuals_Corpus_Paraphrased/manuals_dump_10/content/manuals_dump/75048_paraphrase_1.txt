Be mindful of cooking times to achieve the best results, and preheat whenever necessary to facilitate optimal cooking conditions.

**Grilling Chart**  
The chart below outlines recommended cooking times and shelf positions for various foods, with shelves numbered from the top.  

**Main Oven Usage**  
The main oven is designed for cooking various foods. It is important to preheat the oven as it reaches high temperatures before cooking. Without preheating, food may not reach the advised cooking temperature. Follow the temperature guidelines carefully, and for batch baking, reduce the temperature by 20-25°C.  

**Using the Fan Oven**  
When utilizing the fan oven, be aware that the light indicates when the oven is on. Cooling occurs after switching off the oven, and the cooking time varies based on the oven's temperature reach.  

**Shelf Arrangement in the Main Oven**  
Shelves should be positioned straight and aligned with the back of the oven for optimal cooking results. It is recommended to use central shelves for even heat distribution, and when necessary, adjust spacing to allow for thorough cooking. The choice of cookware, such as enamelware or non-stick options, can enhance browning.  

**Main Oven Cooking Chart**  
The cooking chart offers temperature settings for various foods, with shelf temperature recommendations (in °C) for items like custards and pastries. Additional notes include specific details for roasting meat and baking other dishes.  

**Roasting Chart**  
The roasting chart provides internal temperature guidelines and cooking times for different types of meat, ensuring that the recommended temperatures are achieved for safe consumption.  

**Defrost Feature**  
This function allows for defrosting foods without exposing them to heat, making it ideal for items covered in frostings. Be sure to turn the oven to the Defrost setting, keeping in mind that food should be cooked immediately after defrosting to prevent bacterial growth.  

**Care and Cleaning**  
Ensure the oven has cooled and the electricity supply is switched off before cleaning. Use proper cleaners that do not contain bleach to maintain the surface finishes.  

**Cleaning Guidelines**  
For the outer and inner surfaces, avoid abrasive materials and opt for soft cloths. Manual cleaning is advised for Stayclean surfaces, which can burn off food waste without additional cleaners. Remove wirework runners and oven shelves for thorough cleaning, ensuring any splashes during roasting are managed to minimize staining.  

**Cleaning the Oven Glass**  
Cleaning the glass panels requires specific techniques to avoid damage; if cracked, contact Service Force for assistance.  

**Replacing Bulbs**  
To change the oven light bulb, disconnect the power supply, wait for the bulb to cool, and follow the instructions to safely replace the bulb.  

**Troubleshooting**  
If you encounter issues, check that the oven is plugged in and switched on, review the functions selected, and ensure proper cooking procedures are being followed.
