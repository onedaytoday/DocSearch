### MAN-OCSIG DC Specifications

The DC supply adheres to the technical specifications outlined in EN60950 or the relevant directive. It is crucial that the AC input is considered through an isolated method to activate protective measures in compliance with the standards of EN60742. The DC supply must meet the following criteria: it should provide a single-phase rectified DC supply as necessary. Placement should be managed carefully to ensure proximity to the amplifier, maintaining a distance of no more than the specified foot. For high-inertia loads, the DC supply should be appropriately matched to avoid any adverse effects on amplifier performance.

### MAN-OCSIG Thermal Management

The design includes provisions for heat dissipation from the mounting area and associated assemblies. Thermal resistance is specified in Â°C/W. The system can reach thermal shut-off conditions in approximately seconds, with specific shutdown thresholds reflected below in graphical form: levels recorded include 50V, 40V, 30V, and 20V.

### MAN-OCSRIG DC Motor Connection

Connections for DC Motors are designated at J1 (via M2 and M3). The command input operates at a rated voltage, with a maximum duration of seconds for operation timeout and/or pull-up requirements. Proper resistor values must be applied to facilitate the necessary input signals. The allowable input should reflect the specified V and continuous parameters for both ECLC and ECLP. 

### Internal Voltage Reference

The ECLC and ECLP references at J1/9 and J1/14, respectively, are internally monitored. Whenever the internal voltage (VECLC or VECLP) exceeds 3.75V, the system will adjust accordingly. The minimum voltage for VECLC and VECLP should also be clearly defined.

### Indications and Function Options

The system includes various functional indicators, such as Amplifier OK (AOK), along with additional notes regarding short protections. The indications serve to clarify the operational status, particularly during faults or temporary disablement of inputs.
