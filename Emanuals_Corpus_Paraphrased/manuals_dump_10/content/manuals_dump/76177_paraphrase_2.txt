Ensure proper installation to maximize performance and comply with air quality regulations. Electrolux disclaims any liability for damage or injury resulting from failure to follow installation instructions provided herein.

1. **SAFETY WARNINGS**  
   When utilizing the extraction mode, the ducting for the cooker hood should not connect to systems used for anything other than electric appliances, such as gas heaters. Ensure that electrical connections comply with local regulations, and confirm that the household electrical system is properly grounded.

2. If the room containing the cooker hood has a fuel-burning appliance (e.g., gas boiler), it must be a sealed or balanced flue type to prevent backdraft.

### MAINTENANCE 

#### 4.2 Cleaning Metal Parts

Regular maintenance is vital for optimal performance. Depending on usage, metal filters and charcoal filters should be cleaned or replaced regularly:

1. Clean metal filters every month, or sooner if they become excessively greasy.  
   - You can wash them by hand or in a dishwasher.

2. Replace charcoal filters every three months to maintain effective recirculation. If your environment is particularly greasy, consider cleaning more frequently.

Ensure all components are free from grease buildup to prevent fire hazards, and always follow the cleaning instructions to maintain operational safety.
