### Paraphrased Text:

When selecting laundry options, users can choose between AM Black and other products, regardless of whether it's a preference or a set choice. Traditional powders should be applied directly to clothing, while traditional liquids can be measured as needed. The instructions for compact powders and liquids must be followed closely, including recommendations for placement on the washer's top or back.

Regarding fabric conditioners, these are to be added as per the instructions to improve care for various fabrics. Different washer types may require distinct approaches. Always follow guidelines for using conditioning sheets like Bounce.

Warnings: Some fabrics, especially synthetics, may pose fire risks if not handled properly. Care must be taken to avoid overloading the washer, which can lead to inefficiencies in washing and rinsing.

For drying processes, normal settings may vary based on fabric type, and specific guidelines are outlined in a provided chart. Users should start the machine and pause as necessary for items like towels, ensuring that all are cleaned thoroughly. 

Warning: To prevent creasing, items should be evenly distributed in the washer. Use soak or stain-action settings as needed, applying products gently.

For selection and control, pressing the START/PAUSE button initiates the washing cycle. The machine will display indicators based on user selections. The DELAYED START option allows for adjustments to the wash timing, and pressing the relevant buttons can trigger additional rinse cycles.

The system provides alerts for potential overdosing of detergent. It’s important to comply with recommended amounts to avoid operational issues. When selecting the RINSE HOLD option, adjustments to spin speeds can be made as needed.

Users should also ensure that hose connections are secure and appropriately positioned to avoid leaks. For emergency emptying, instructions for draining the washer are available. 

In case of issues such as alarms or incorrect functioning during operation, it’s essential to refer to troubleshooting sections and follow the outlined processes carefully. Lastly, cleaning maintenance can enhance performance; ensure hoses are clear and fittings are tightly secured for optimum efficiency.
