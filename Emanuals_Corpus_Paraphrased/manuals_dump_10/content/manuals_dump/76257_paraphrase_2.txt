Certainly! Here's a paraphrased version of the technical text while retaining its meaning:

To switch the options, begin by pressing the designated button for the light. If necessary, first turn off the system. If the device is already locked, it could indicate that the temperature is too high or heating is already in progress. To manage this, switch off the device and close the necessary compartments. At the end of the cycle, the light indicator will automatically turn off alongside an acoustic signal. Follow the instructions below to make adjustments.

To select or finalize a program, press the corresponding button, and ensure the system is off afterward. The machine will stop once it has completed the process. The brightness levels can be adjusted based on selected washing programs. For washing cotton, the cycle can be effective even at 60°C, handling white and colored items efficiently. It is important to wash white and colored items separately, ideally at 40°C or 60°C.

For jeans and high-tech fabrics, the cold wash option is activated automatically. Utilize options like "Spin Reduction," "Rinse Hold," "Prewash," and "Extra Rinse" as needed. Short cycles are available for synthetic garments to prevent creasing. The "Short Wash" for delicate fabrics like acrylics and viscose provides gentler cleaning capabilities.

For heavily soiled items, a prewash phase is recommended. Ensure not to overload the machine, particularly for synthetics, where packing should not exceed a third of the drum. For stubborn stains, it's advisable to pre-treat with appropriate additives, considering fabric types and washing temperatures.

Always follow care instructions for the specific fabrics during sorting and washing. Using proper additives can enhance cleanliness, while adhering to the recommended guidelines aids in effective washing.

For maintenance, disconnect the device from the power supply before cleaning. Routine cleaning should be conducted according to the operational guidelines, including regular checks and inspections for optimal performance. When dealing with the emptying system, ensure everything is cooled down adequately before proceeding to clean and secure the components properly.

If any emergency situations arise, such as operating issues indicated by warning lights or sounds, take immediate action as described. Ensure all connections are secure and monitored for proper functionality. Deactivate child locks if needed and address any clogs or blockages promptly, following the given service instructions to maintain efficiency and safety.
