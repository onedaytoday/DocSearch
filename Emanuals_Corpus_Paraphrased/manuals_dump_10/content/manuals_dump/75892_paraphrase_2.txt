To manually activate the FAST CHILL/-FREEZE function, press the recessed switch. The appliance has a child-proof switching mechanism that allows it to be turned off safely. To power off, hold the ON/OFF button for several seconds until the countdown from a designated number reaches zero, at which point the appliance will switch off.

When in standby mode, the temperature can rise to +15°C. It's crucial to avoid unintentionally closing the appliance as this can promote mold growth. To adjust the temperature from standby, turn the recessed dial counterclockwise until it reaches +10°C or +15°C, and press the recessed button to finalize the setting.

The appliance issues warnings through both visual and acoustic signals if the temperature rises too high or if there is a potential thawing event. The warning will flash if temperatures exceed 5°C beyond the selected setting. This warning will deactivate automatically after a certain time or when the temperature normalizes.

In case of partial or complete thawing, the appliance can indicate when items have been warmed excessively, especially for sensitive foods. If technical malfunctions occur, error codes (F1 to F7) will appear, indicating the need for a service technician to resolve the issues.

When organizing food items, position them on the appropriate shelves and racks for optimal cooling, as warmer air tends to accumulate on the upper shelves. Different food types, especially meat, should be stored at designated temperatures to maintain their freshness. 

For defrosting, remove frost buildup when it reaches a certain thickness, and ensure that the appliance is not obstructed to facilitate efficient cooling. To clean, disconnect the power supply and follow the appropriate cleaning procedures to avoid damage from harsh chemicals.

If the appliance emits warning signals or flashes error codes, contact the AEG Service Force for assistance, providing the purchase information for reference. Please ensure that regular maintenance is performed to avoid issues and prolong the appliance's lifespan.
