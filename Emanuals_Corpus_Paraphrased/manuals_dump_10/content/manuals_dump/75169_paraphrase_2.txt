The LW GN tradition prioritizes creativity and professionalism in operation, offering high efficiency in cooking and chilling. The air-o-steam B model features operational modes such as convection, enabling meat to be cooked without the need for gratin, as well as a half-power steam function that optimizes food preparation. This steam cooking method decreases cooking times and improves the quality of dishes, including cakes. It provides options to hold food at the desired temperature while maintaining optimal cooking conditions.

The system is designed with HACCP compliance in mind, allowing for detailed recording of cooking processes and overall performance monitoring. The cooking chamber features adjustable height and bi-functional capabilities to manage fresh ingredients effectively.

With a durable construction, the chamber is thermally glazed and designed to reduce buildup, with IPX5 protection guaranteeing resilience.
