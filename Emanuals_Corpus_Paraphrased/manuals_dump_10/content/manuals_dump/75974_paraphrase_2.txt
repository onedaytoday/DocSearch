### Ice and Water Dispenser Features

The dispenser provides options for both crushed and cubed ice. To use it, press the appropriate button to catch the ice or water. Detailed operation instructions are attached to the unit, which must be connected to a suitable water supply for optimal performance. It is recommended to flush the system before initial use to remove any chemicals.

To prevent malfunction, ensure that the water supply is correctly connected and the dispenser has been adequately cooled, usually within three hours of activation. For manual ice dispensing, use the built-in arm, and keep the area free of obstructions.

### Ice Dispenser Tips

To operate the ice dispenser effectively, keep the On/Off switch turned on. Separate any ice that may have fused together before using the dispenser. If the water supply is turned off, the On/Off switch must be adjusted accordingly. 

#### Cleaning the Ice Dispenser

Before cleaning, turn off the On/Off switch and empty the compartment. Use clear cleaners to sanitize the area, allowing it to dry completely before resuming operation. Important: Never use abrasive materials or aggressive chemicals that may damage the dispenser.

### PureSource™ Ice and Water

If your model includes PureSource™, follow the guidelines for installation and maintenance. The water supply should be verified for proper connection, and the unit should be routinely serviced per the manufacturer's specifications. The PureSource™ system is tested to NSF International standards for safety and performance.

### Food Storage Ideas

Fresh food should be stored at temperatures between 32°F to 40°F, avoiding overcrowding to ensure proper airflow and cooling efficiency. Wrap meat securely to prevent cross-contamination and freezer burn. Efficient storage keeps air circulation optimal, allowing hard-to-freeze items to remain fresh.

### Energy Saving Tips

Reduce heat exposure from sunlight and appliances like dishwashers. Ensure cabinets are well insulated to maintain efficiency. Avoid overcrowding the refrigerator with food items, and use covers to minimize frost build-up.

- **A.** Humming or vibration from the compressor.
- **B.** Water flowing through the system.
- **C.** Hissing sounds from the defrost heater.
- **D.** Mechanical noises during defrost cycles.

If any unusual sounds occur, check the system to ensure everything is functioning properly.
