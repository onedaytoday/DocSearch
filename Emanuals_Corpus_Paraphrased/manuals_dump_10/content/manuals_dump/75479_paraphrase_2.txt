### Procedural Instructions for Electrical Testing and Conversion

**A. Earth Continuity Check:**  
Ensure that the appliance is electrically disconnected. Verify that the earth leads to the earth connection are secure and that there are no loose or damaged wires.  

**B. Insulation Check:**  
With the appliance disconnected from the power supply, turn on the switches. Measure the insulation resistance from earth to all live leads. If the reading is below the required threshold, inspect for faults. A reading of "infinity" indicates satisfactory insulation. 

**C. Polarity Check:**  
Confirm the correct polarity by testing from 'N' and 'L' terminals. Ensure all connections are secure and that there is no evidence of burning or arcing around terminals.

**D. Supply Verification:**  
Observe the status of switches; all should be in the correct position. Manually operate each switch and verify the light indicators at the terminals.

### Commissioning Procedure:
1. Set the control to MAX and then to MIN.
2. Gradually adjust from MIN to MAX. If the light remains on without extinguishing, proceed to the next steps.
3. Utilize a thin screwdriver to adjust the screw located on the device to ensure proper operation.
4. Power up the appliance and monitor for stable operation at both MIN and MAX settings before finalizing.

### Conversion from Air to LPG:
1. Disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply.
2. Adjust the LPG injectors as per specifications.
3. Utilize a thin screwdriver to tighten or loosen screws as required for proper function.
4. Confirm that adjustments are compliant with the specified ratings to ensure safety and performance.

**Note:** It is critical to follow all safety instructions during these procedures.
