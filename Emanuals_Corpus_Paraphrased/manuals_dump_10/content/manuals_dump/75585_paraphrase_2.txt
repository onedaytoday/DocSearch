The system comprises coolers operating within a temperature range of -2/+8°C, featuring various thicknesses and options for built-in or modular designs. This assembly is designed for straightforward installation, utilizing pre-charged cooling technology. Constructed with high-quality insulation materials, including pre-painted polyurethane that is both CFC and HCFC-free, the units incorporate rounded internal corners for better hygiene.

The fast-fit design facilitates easy installation, while the PVC components ensure airtight seals for optimal performance at high ambient temperatures (+43°C) and with refrigerants such as R404A. The defrost system employs a heated mechanism, which minimizes frost build-up, complemented by internal lighting (IP54 rated). Each unit comes equipped with an ON/OFF switch, lighting controls, and a functioning thermostat.
