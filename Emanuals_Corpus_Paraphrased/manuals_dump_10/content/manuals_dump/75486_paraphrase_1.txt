### Function Overview

The phase selection function adjusts the heat as needed. When the heat selection is active, indicator lights illuminate for several seconds following activation. If a higher heat setting is selected, the previous setting is overridden, and this change is displayed visibly. 

To deactivate the function, simply touch the heat selection field; the corresponding indicator lights will turn off. If the function is engaged, it can be switched off immediately upon touch. A safety feature ensures that cooking is suspended if a child activates the control; an audible signal will sound while a countdown occurs.

For safety, if children manipulate the controls, the system locks automatically, and it will require a specific touch sequence to unlock. Furthermore, the finish of the heating element is designed to prevent scratches and maintain integrity, though they should be cleaned regularly to avoid any damage.

### Cooking Without the Function

For optimal performance, the warm-up function is recommended for dishes that require gradual heating, such as stews and goulash. Food should be monitored closely as high heat can accelerate cooking times. 

### Cleaning Procedures

For cleaning, use appropriate commercial cleaners to maintain the appliance in top condition, ensuring that surfaces are wiped down after use to prevent burnt residues. Once cooled, any stubborn food residue may need scraping or specialty cleaners from approved sources.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions

In case of a malfunction, the appliance may stop functioning and display an error code. The overheat protection feature will activate if temperatures exceed thresholds. To reset, allow the appliance to cool and disconnect it from the power supply. If the issue persists, consult the manufacturer or a qualified service technician for further assistance.
