The system incorporates features that enhance performance and efficiency. The structure, made from AISI stainless steel, includes adjustable base, top, and back heights for straightforward internal access. It allows for complete defrosting, ensuring high hygiene and ease of cleaning, thanks to the rounded interior design that facilitates maintenance without obstruction. The unit operates with a forced cooling system at +43Â°C to maintain uniformity. Insulation is provided by high-density expanded polyurethane, injected with cyclopenthane, offering long-term thermal retention.

The interior is designed to accommodate GN containers and includes self-closing doors for practicality. The recessed handles enable easy opening, and the system is equipped with a microswitch that shuts off the cooling mechanism when the door is opened. Additionally, the materials used are CFC and HCFC-free, aligning with international standards and CE compliance.
