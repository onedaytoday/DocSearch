It is essential to follow the specifications outlined, ensuring compliance with installation instructions for optimal performance.

Ensure that any electrical work complies with local regulations and is conducted by a qualified technician.

**Initial Setup and Operational Features**  
The appliance features an ON/OFF switch. "0" indicates the appliance is off, while "1" signifies the highest (warmest) setting. Recommended initial settings and adjustments for optimal food storage temperatures are provided in the manual.

**Defrosting Instructions**  
To facilitate defrosting, the "Defrosting" mode may be utilized. Heavy frost build-up can affect performance, so it's essential to regularly check and manage frost accumulation.

**Shelving and Storage**  
Adjustable shelves allow for customization based on the items stored. Ensure that items do not obstruct ventilation or airflow. Proper arrangement maximizes storage efficiency and maintains optimal conditions for food preservation.

**Cleaning Guidelines**  
Always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply before cleaning. Use non-abrasive cleaning agents, avoiding bleach-based products that can damage surfaces. Clear any debris from drainage points to prevent water accumulation. Ensure that the exterior surfaces are maintained for longevity.

**Normal Operation Sounds**  
You may hear various sounds during operation, such as whirring from the compressor. These sounds are typical and indicate normal functioning. Ensure that nothing obstructs airflow to maintain efficient cooling.

**Troubleshooting**  
If the appliance exhibits unusual sounds, check for any obstructions and ensure that the doors close properly. The thermostat settings should be verified, and any recent changes in food placement should be noted as these can affect cooling performance.

For further assistance or if issues remain unresolved, please contact AEG Service Force. Always ensure to comply with the relevant household regulations and guidelines during operation and maintenance.

**Technical Terminology**  
The appliance uses heat transfer mechanisms to maintain food temperature, drawing heat away from the interior. Proper placement and installation are crucial for efficient operation and reduce heat emission to the surroundings. 

By following these instructions, users can ensure safe and effective operation of their SANTO appliance.
