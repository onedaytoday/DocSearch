To set up your system, connect the receiverâ€™s ANT.IN port to the appropriate source, typically using a standard white cable for audio. If your receiver supports RF signals, connect the RF output accordingly. For high-quality recording, ensure your TV is capable of NTSC and compatible software, provided on the included CD-ROM. After unpacking, follow the on-screen prompts to proceed with the installation specific to your region. Generally, your TV should be linked to other devices like a VCR or DVD player, which also need to be routed to the AUDIO R input. 

Note that both receivers require a DC-12V power supply, and AAA batteries can be used as an optional power source. Ensure you switch to the correct input settings on your TV for optimal recording and playback functionality.
