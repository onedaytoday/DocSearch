For specific information, please adhere to the guidelines provided. Note that the Black Top model does not come with an accompanying warranty for installations or modifications. For technical inquiries, refer to the warranty details available on our website. Unauthorized adjustments may compromise safety; hence ensure proper grounding of the outlet supplying power to avoid potential shock or fire hazards. Ensure the power cord is appropriately rated to avoid overheating, whether the load is light or heavy.

Be advised that if issues arise with the cord or if it becomes damaged, immediate disconnection from the power supply is essential. If interference occurs with reception, follow troubleshooting steps by turning off the device and adjusting the positioning of both the unit and the receiver to mitigate issues.

Please ensure secure mounting of brackets and fasteners during installation for safety. The installation requires specific items, which are outlined on our website, including screws, anchors, and a mounting bracket.
