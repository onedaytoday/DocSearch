**Safety Precautions:**
To prevent exposure to excessive microwave energy, do not disable any safety interlocks. Follow all instructions carefully, and ensure the microwave is properly grounded. This appliance is intended for heating, cooking, or defrosting food exclusively.

**Operational Guidelines:**
When using the microwave:
- Avoid overheating food, particularly items that may not show visible signs of heat, such as liquids and sealed containers.
- If food appears to be boiling over, turn off the microwave.

Use appropriate coverings to prevent splatters and promote even cooking. Certain types of cookware, including heat-resistant glass and ceramic, are suitable. Avoid using materials not designated as microwave-safe.

**Cooking Instructions:**
Monitor food while it cooks to avoid burning. Adjust cooking time based on the type of food and its thickness. Be attentive to the microwave's operational cues, such as cooling sounds, to prevent overheating.

**Operational Procedures:**
To set the clock or clear settings, follow the touchscreen prompts. If there's power interruption, the clock must be reset for accurate timing. Ensure all settings are confirmed before cooking.
