### Preheating and Cooking Guidelines

When baking breads, cakes, or roasting, ensure the oven is preheated. The temperature should not exceed the recommended level by more than 25°F (12°C) to prevent overcrowding and uneven cooking. Preheating should be completed before placing food in the oven to ensure optimal results.

#### Convection Baking

Convection cooking utilizes a fan to circulate heated air around food, promoting even cooking and browning. This method is efficient for baking and roasting. Adjust cooking times and temperatures according to the food type, generally allowing for a reduction in temperature when using convection settings. Ensure food is not overcrowded in the oven, as this can hinder air circulation.

#### Timed Bake and Timed Convection Bake

To use the timed bake feature, set your desired cooking time and temperature (e.g., 350°F). The oven will automatically turn off once the cooking time is completed. Similarly, for timed convection bake, configure the settings to suit your specific needs.

#### Delayed Timed Bake and Delayed Timed Convection Bake

To set a delayed cooking time, program the oven to begin cooking at a later time while ensuring it will reach the desired temperature, such as 350°F. 

#### Broiling

Preheat the broiler according to the instructions. Broiling involves high direct heat usually at temperatures around 550°F. Do not cover food with grease that can catch fire. Always monitor the cooking process closely to avoid flare-ups.

#### Self-Cleaning Feature

Utilize the self-clean feature to maintain the oven’s cleanliness. Do not use cleaners or protective coatings on self-cleaning ovens. Allow the oven to cool before starting the cleaning cycle, which typically lasts several hours based on the level of cleaning required. Once the cycle is complete, ensure the oven is cool before accessing it.

#### Starting and Delaying the Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate a self-cleaning cycle, set the desired duration, which varies from light to heavy soil settings. The oven will lock during this process for safety. For delayed self-cleaning, program the oven in advance as needed. Always ensure the oven door is securely closed during these operations.

By following these guidelines, your cooking and cleaning processes will be effective and safe.

### General Cleaning Instructions

When cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and cool. Address spills and heavy stains immediately to minimize the need for extensive cleanings later on. Regular maintenance is recommended.

For painted, decorative, or chrome racks, use a soft cloth to clean. Directly apply a suitable cleaner to the cloth and avoid abrasive cleaners that could scratch the surface. Always turn the appliance off before cleaning and use a light touch with the cleaner. Avoid scouring pads or harsh chemicals, as these can cause permanent damage. If needed, cover stubborn spots with a cleaner, let it sit, and then wipe off with a cloth.

For stainless steel surfaces, refer to the cleaning instructions specific to this material. If you need to remove and replace the oven door, consult the proper section for guidance.

### Oven Light Maintenance

For light cleaning, refer to the provided instructions. If you encounter issues with error codes (F1 through F10), use the CANCEL function or contact an authorized service technician. In cases where the oven does not operate, check the power supply connections and ensure the circuit breaker hasn’t tripped.

### Common Issues

- **Oven Light Malfunctions:** Check for burned-out bulbs and replace them as necessary.
- **Self-Cleaning Cycle Problems:** Ensure the oven door is securely closed. If the self-cleaning process is interrupted, follow the instructions for restarting it.
- **Excessive Smoking During Broiling:** Ensure proper clearance for cooking meat and allow grease to properly drain to prevent flare-ups.
