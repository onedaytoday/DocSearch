The refrigeration system comprises coolers operating in the temperature range of -2 to +8°C, designed with precise thickness and equipped with either built-in or supplementary components. This setup requires specialized knowledge for assembly and installation. A new injection method enhances both the performance and quality of the pre-painted Polyurethane insulation, ensuring it's free of CFCs and HCFCs. The design features rounded internal corners for improved airflow, while the fast-fit assembly enables secure mounting with airtight PVC elements. The unit is capable of functioning in high ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) and is compatible with refrigerants R404A and others.

Defrosting efficiency is achieved through a heated system that minimizes downtime and maintains internal lighting (IP54) for visibility. The unit includes an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting switch, operational controls, and a thermostat. Right-hinged doors are designed with smooth cam-lift action hinges to ensure an airtight seal and high insulation, which optimizes energy efficiency. Compliance with HACCP standards is incorporated, along with available accessories.
