**Chilling Process Overview**

The 20GN2/1 unit efficiently cools cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly minimizing bacterial growth during the chilling process. This model is designed to transition food from +90°C to +3°C and subsequently maintain it at temperatures down to -18°C for optimal shelf life. 

**Operating Modes**

The appliance features various chilling modes including Soft Chilling (+2°C) and Shock Chilling (+3°C or -18°C). Each mode is activated individually, allowing for continuous cooling in compliance with UK and NF regulations. Built-in UV lights (available as an accessory) facilitate the preservation of meats, while the user interface provides countdowns and service information. 

**Performance Metrics**

Chilling from +90°C to +3°C must occur within a limit of four hours to meet HACCP standards. The performance and parameters can be tracked, and all information is logged, especially in cases of abnormal terminations.
