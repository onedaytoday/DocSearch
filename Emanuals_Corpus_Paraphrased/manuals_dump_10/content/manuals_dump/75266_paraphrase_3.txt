### INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREHEATING

Set the oven to preheat as needed. The preheating range is between 170°F and 550°F. The oven will notify you when it has reached the desired temperature. 

**Note:** Follow the visual prompts on the display for guidance during preheating and while cooking.

By ensuring the safety and operation guidelines are followed, you can effectively utilize this appliance and ensure its longevity.

**Baking Instructions:** 

To begin, preheat the oven according to the required temperature—generally set to 350°F (175°C). If you need to adjust the temperature to 425°F (220°C), ensure it reaches 350°F first before making any changes. Avoid overcrowding the oven, as this can lead to improper heat distribution and cooking. Ensure ample space between food items for optimal circulation and efficient cooking.

When baking cookies, bread, or cakes, it's critical to follow the preheating instructions carefully. For best results, maintain a temperature no higher than prescribed and be mindful of the cooking chart provided. Monitor the oven frequently to prevent overheating or warping of trays.

**Convection Baking:**

Convection baking involves heating the food using a fan that circulates hot air from the rear of the oven, promoting even cooking. Utilize this method for batch cooking and defrosting. The airflow enhances cooking efficiency by reducing cooking times compared to traditional methods. Adjust cooking times based on the food type and size. Foods should not be overcrowded to allow for proper air movement.

**Timed Bake or Timed Convection Bake Setting:**

You can set the oven to cook for a specific period, either for standard baking or convection baking, by adjusting the timer and temperature accordingly. The oven will automatically shut off when the timer completes its cycle. For best practices, use appropriate cooking racks and ensure food is evenly placed.

**Delayed Timed Bake:**

This function allows you to program your oven to start cooking at a later time. Set the desired cook time and temperature, and the oven will initiate the process as scheduled, automatically shutting off at completion.

**Broiling Instructions:**

Preheat the oven for broiling, ensuring high heat is maintained for effective searing. Position food under the broiler, seasoning as desired, and monitor to prevent burning. Keep grease and other flammable materials away from heating elements to reduce fire risks. In case of flame, utilize a fire extinguisher or cover the flames with a lid.

**Convection Roasting:**

For roasting, ensure proper placement within the oven to allow air circulation around the meat. Adjust the temperature as needed, with options ranging from 300°F (149°C) to 550°F (288°C). Avoid covering food to enable effective roasting and crisping.

**Starting Self-Clean Cycle:**

When initiating the self-cleaning process, let the oven cool down first. The cleaning cycle can take about one to three hours, depending on the level of cleaning required (light or heavy). Ensure that children are kept away and the door lock engages during cleaning. Once the cycle is complete and the oven cools down, the door will unlock, allowing you to resume normal usage. 

Follow these steps for effectively operating and maintaining your oven.

### Cleaning Instructions for the Delayed Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate the delayed self-clean cycle, ensure the oven door is closed. You can start the cycle by pressing the appropriate buttons, and it will automatically turn off after a set number of hours. Should you wish to begin self-cleaning, be aware that it can be set for light or heavy soiling. During the cycle, the "DOOR LOCKED" indicator will flash, and you’ll need to wait until the cycle completes. 

### General Cleaning

For regular maintenance, promptly clean up spills and heavy stains. Performing routine cleanings will minimize the need for extensive future cleanings. When addressing painted, decorative, or chrome parts, use a gentle cleaner and a soft cloth to avoid scratching. For built-up grease, use a suitable cleaner but refrain from abrasive materials. Always turn the oven off before cleaning.

The oven light, located at the front of the appliance, should be covered with a shield. The shield must be in place whenever the oven is operational. Cleaning the shield requires caution; ensure the oven is cool and use protective gear.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

If the control panel beeps and displays error codes ranging from F1 to F10, press CANCEL to clear the alert. For F8 errors, it may indicate a malfunction in the self-cleaning system. If the oven doesn’t operate, check the power supply and ensure all connections are secure. If an issue persists, contact an authorized servicer.

Further, if the self-cleaning mode fails or if the oven produces excessive smoke during broiling, assess whether the meat is too close to the heating element and adjust accordingly.
