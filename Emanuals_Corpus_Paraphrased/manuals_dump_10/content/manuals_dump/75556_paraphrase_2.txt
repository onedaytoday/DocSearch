**Cleaning Burner Grates, Caps, and Heads**  
To clean the burner heads and grates, avoid using abrasive materials. Regularly wash these parts—dishwasher cleaning is acceptable for grates. Ensure that spills, food, cleaning products, or any other materials do not enter the gas orifice holder opening. Always check that the head and grate are correctly positioned when using the cooktop, as it is not removable.

**Porcelain Enamel Cooktop Cleaning Instructions**  
**Warning:** Ensure proper health measures when cleaning. Turn off and cool the cooktop before using any cleaners. Avoid heavy-duty cleaners that may damage the surface. Allow grease and food to cool before attempting to remove them. Use a soft cloth for wiping, and clean gently, covering heavily burned areas with appropriate cleaning solutions.

**Common Cooking Issues**  
When cooking, ensure proper preheating, particularly for items like breads and cakes. Avoid overcrowding and excessive heat to prevent uneven cooking. Follow specified temperature guidelines for optimal results, allowing items to reach the desired cooking temperature without warping. 

**Service Concerns**  
For any operational issues, including an error code being displayed or the oven not functioning after installation, refer to the installation instructions and contact an authorized servicer.

**Self-Cleaning Cycle Issues**  
Ensure that the oven door is properly closed to activate the self-cleaning feature. Excessive smoke during broiling may indicate that the meat needs repositioning to ensure proper clearance. Additionally, grease buildup requires regular cleaning.

**Common Problem Solutions**  
For flames inside the oven or if surface burners do not light completely, ensure the burners are clean and free from blockages. Address any uneven heating issues by checking cookware compatibility.

**Conclusion**  
Regular and proper maintenance of each component is crucial for optimal performance and longevity of the appliance. Always follow safety precautions and manufacturer guidelines while cleaning and operating the oven.
