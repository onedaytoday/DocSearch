When positioning the appliance, ensure it is appropriately spaced from heat sources, and avoid direct sunlight to prevent overheating. The appliance should be left upright for several hours upon installation or after being moved to allow for proper coolant circulation.

**Safety Precautions:** 

- Do not allow children to play near the appliance, as this may pose a suffocation risk.
- Switch off the appliance immediately during cleaning or in the event of a fire, and disconnect it from power. 
- Do not attempt repairs unless you are a qualified technician, as unauthorized handling may lead to severe malfunction.

**Material Information:**
The exterior is made from untreated wood, while the plastics are categorized as follows:  
- **PE** (Polyethylene) for the outer covering  
- **PS** (Polystyrene) for internal components

Ensure that all parts of the appliance are securely assembled. The front and back sections should be positioned correctly and ensure there is adequate airflow.

**Electrical Instructions:** 
This appliance must be earthed. Make connections according to the ratings specified in the instructions. The wiring color code is as follows:

**Appliance Controls:**
To operate, press the ON/OFF button and select the FAST CHILL feature. An indicator light will signal when cooling is active. Use the (WARMER) and (COLDER) buttons to adjust the temperature settings, which will be displayed as numerical values. The system will revert to its default settings if left unattended.

**Operational Guidelines:**
Operate the appliance at the recommended temperature to prevent food spoilage. Be mindful of shelf placements for optimal cooling, as items should be stored properly to avoid obstruction of airflow. For perishable goods, utilize a thermometer to ensure temperatures do not exceed safe limits.

For additional guidance or operational tips, consult the sections on cleaning and maintenance provided in this manual. If any issues arise, refer to troubleshooting protocols before contacting customer service.

**Normal Operational Sounds:**

You may hear various sounds from the front or rear areas related to cooling, such as a whirring noise from the thermostat. This can occur when the thermostat activates. It's important to ensure that food is properly arranged inside to allow for even heat circulation—obstructions, such as improperly covered items, can hinder cooling performance. If food is not stored correctly, it may cool down more slowly than intended.

**Automatic Defrosting:**

The automatic defrosting feature collects condensation in a trough at the back of the appliance. For cleaning, ensure that the unit is disconnected from the electrical supply. Use appropriate cleaning products that do not contain bleach or harsh chemicals, as these may damage the appliance. Always follow safety precautions when cleaning.
