### LAVAMAT Washer-Dryer Manual: Optimal Performance and Functionality

Dear Customer, please familiarize yourself with these operating instructions. They serve as a reference for both the initial setup and ongoing ownership. Take note of the warnings and informational sections regarding operation and maintenance to ensure optimal functionality.

This manual includes important details about the features of your washer-dryer, including various option buttons: PREWASH, STAIN, SENSITIVE, TIME SAVER, START/PAUSE, SPIN SPEED, RINSE HOLD, ELECTRONIC DRYING, DRYING TIME, and DELAY TIMER. Before using the machine, sort and weigh the laundry appropriately, and select suitable additives.

The drying duration can be adjusted based on the weight and items being washed. You can choose between different spin speeds and rinse options to enhance cleaning effectiveness and minimize wrinkling. The DELAY TIMER allows for scheduling wash cycles at a later time.

In case of problems, refer to the troubleshooting section for solutions, and consult the Technical Service for any servicing needs. Avoid attempting repairs if you are inexperienced, as this could lead to further complications. For safety, follow the provided instructions to prevent accidents and ensure proper operation.

**Child Safety**: Ensure that children are kept at a safe distance from the appliance when in operation. The machine must be powered off when not in use.

**Washing Guidelines**: 
- Only wash items as recommended based on their care labels. Use the appropriate options for different fabric types (e.g., COTTON, SENSITIVE).
- Heavy stains may require a prewash phase before the main wash. Use stain removers as specified.
- For synthetic fabrics and delicates, adhere to specific settings designed to prevent damage.

**Operational Modes**: 
- The START/PAUSE feature allows you to interrupt cycles when necessary. If the DELAY TIMER is selected, it initiates a countdown for the wash.
- Use the SPIN SPEED options to adjust the drying approach based on fabric type.

Take care when loading items: sort laundry by color and fabric type to ensure optimal washing results. Wash whites separately from colored items to maintain brightness. New colored items may bleed; wash them with similar colors until they are colorfast.

For best performance, follow the washing instructions outlined in this manual regarding temperature settings and detergent use. Specific detergents should be used as applicable, including non-biological powders for sensitive skin, and avoid excessive use of bleach or harsh detergents, which may damage items.

This manual aims to enhance your understanding of the washer-dryerâ€™s functions for better care of your laundry. Thank you for choosing LAVAMAT.

The text discusses various washing machine settings and instructions for optimal use. 

For laundry detergents, users can choose between conventional powders and liquids. Traditional powders are applied directly to clothes, while liquids can be added through specific compartments designated for various washing cycles. It's important to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for loading fabric conditioners, which enhance washing results, particularly for easy-care fabrics.

Warnings include the risk of excessive washing times leading to issues with synthetic items, and precautions against fire hazards from improperly used materials. Proper drying settings should be selected based on the item type, as indicated in a reference chart.

The START/PAUSE button controls the cycle, allowing users to pause during operations. Additionally, options like RINSE HOLD can be utilized to prevent wrinkles. Other features include EXTRA RINSE for sensitive skin and the ability to delay the wash cycle, which is indicated by related lights on the control panel.

For troubleshooting, error codes such as E10, E20, and E40 help identify issues related to water supply and drainage. It's crucial to ensure hoses are properly connected and not clogged. Cleaning instructions involve removing blockages from hoses and ensuring all components are free from residue to maintain efficiency.

Correctly following these guidelines ensures optimal performance of the washing machine while prolonging its lifespan.

Certainly! Here's the paraphrased version of the text:

The instructions indicate that the EF function should be checked. Ensure that the hose is properly attached and secured to avoid cleaning issues. Be aware of the emptying hose segment as it may impact functionality. The appliance's heating phase should operate correctly to facilitate cloth drying. If the DOOR light is off, it may indicate an issue requiring attention from the AEG Service Force.

If the load distribution is uneven, it may necessitate manual adjustment to balance the contents better. Problems such as clogged drains (E10) should be addressed by cleaning the relevant components. Select the appropriate settings based on fabric types or washing conditions.

In case of persistent laundry problems, ensure that the correct wash cycle has been chosen to manage stubborn stains effectively. If items are treated with ointments, grease, or excessive detergents, they may not rinse thoroughly, leading to unsatisfactory results.
