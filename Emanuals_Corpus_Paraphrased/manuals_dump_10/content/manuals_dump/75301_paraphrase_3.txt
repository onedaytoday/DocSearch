### Instructions for the Built-In EOB GB IE

**General Information:**
This appliance is designed for use in British households and is safe when operated correctly, but care must be taken to avoid potential hazards, especially for children. Ensure the appliance is cooled before use and during cooking to prevent burns. Use heatproof cookware and allow steam to escape properly. Ensure that dishcloths, towels, or clothing do not come into contact with hot surfaces. Turn the appliance off when not in use and follow the cleaning instructions carefully.

**Installation and Handling:**
For installation and maintenance, refer to the appropriate service personnel. If you experience malfunctions or overheating issues, disconnect the power supply. Cleaning products should be suitable for household use and should not contain bleach, as this may damage the appliance's finish.

**Thermostat and Functions:**
The appliance features a thermostat with a temperature range from 50°C to 230°C (MAX). The thermostat light indicates when the desired temperature has been reached and will turn off upon completion of cooking, accompanied by an audible signal. Follow the recommended cooking chart for optimal results.

**Cooking Guidelines:**
Before cooking, preheat the appliance as needed. The cooking function allows for even heat distribution, while proper ventilation is crucial. Avoid placing cookware that exceeds the recommended temperature limits directly on the base. 

**Cooking Charts:**
Refer to the specific cooking chart for various dishes, such as cakes, meats, and bread, adjusting temperatures as necessary to avoid excessive browning. Use a meat thermometer to ensure meats are cooked thoroughly.

**Defrosting:**
The defrosting function operates without heat to gradually thaw food. Ensure that all food is cooked immediately after defrosting, following proper food safety protocols.

**Cleaning Procedures:**
Clean the appliance only after it has cooled down, avoiding harsh chemicals and abrasives that could damage its surface. For heavy buildup, use designated cleaning products. If the unit becomes scratched or chipped, consult service personnel for guidance. 

By following these instructions, users can effectively and safely operate the EOB GB IE appliance.

**Cavity Maintenance and Light Replacement Instructions**

To maintain cleanliness, ensure the cavity is thoroughly wiped down with a cloth. For the shelf supports, clean them in a similar manner using a cloth to facilitate easy handling and cleaning. When removing the shelf, please be cautious. If you're replacing the light, adhere to the following specifications: 25W max, 300°C, E14 type. 

Before servicing, disconnect the appliance from the power supply. To remove the cover, turn it counterclockwise. Once you’ve replaced the light, reattach the cover and reconnect the power supply.

**Troubleshooting**  
If you encounter issues such as inadequate light or uneven cooking, verify the cooking function is correctly selected and that the wiring is intact. Ensure that the switch is operating and that the thermostat is set appropriately.
