### Food Storage Recommendations

#### Fresh Food
To maintain freshness, store food at a temperature of 32°F to 40°F and avoid overcrowding shelves. This allows for optimal air circulation, enhancing cooling efficiency. Wrap meats securely to prevent cross-contamination and ensure proper sealing with airtight options. Loading food too tightly can lead to freezer burn and compromise quality. Arrange food so that items have space to circulate, especially harder-to-freeze options like certain fruits and vegetables.

#### Energy Saving Tips
Maximize energy efficiency by positioning the refrigerator away from heat sources like sunlight, ovens, and dishwashers. Ensure that cabinetry is well-insulated and that the appliance door closes tightly. Regularly clean the appliance and its surroundings to maintain optimal performance. 

### Understanding Common Sounds
Be aware of the typical sounds your high-efficiency refrigerator may produce, including:
- **A.** The flow of refrigerant.
- **B.** Air being forced through vents.
- **C.** Hissing from the defrost heater.
- **D.** Clicking noises when the compressor cycles.
- **E.** Sounds from the defrost heater operating.
- **F.** Air circulation noises.
- **G.** High-pitched sounds indicating proper function.
- **H.** Water sounds associated with the water drip pan.
- **I.** Fan operation noises.

Ensure cleanliness around the coils to prevent buildup and maintain efficiency.
