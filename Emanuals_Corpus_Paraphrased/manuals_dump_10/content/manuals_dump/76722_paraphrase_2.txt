### Installation Manual for ELK-M1XEP Ethernet Interface

#### Overview
The ELK-M1XEP Ethernet interface enables connectivity to the M1 control panel via Ethernet TCP/IP. It features an integrated RS-232 interface and supports FIPS-compliant algorithms. This manual includes important installation notes and specifications.

#### Important Notice
The M1XEP is pre-configured to obtain an IP address via DHCP. For optimal functionality, it is highly recommended to connect M1XEP directly to the router. Refer to the respective sections for detailed connection methods and specifications.

#### Application
The ELK-M1XEP interfaces with the M1 product family to provide Ethernet TCP/IP connectivity. It is powered by a DC power supply (included) and operates in conjunction with a router or Ethernet switch, which must support UPS backup to ensure reliability.

#### Features
- DHCP support for automatic IP configuration
- Supports protocols: TCP, UDP, DHCP, SSL 3.0/TLS, HTTP, and SMTP
- RS-232 connection using a DB9M connector
- Diagnostic LEDs to indicate normal operation and connection status

#### Specifications
- Power Supply: 12V DC (from ELK-P1216, included)
- Ethernet Connection: RJ45 connector for LAN/WAN
- LED Indicators: Normal operation indicated by LED states

#### Network Setup
1. Connect the M1XEP to the network via an RJ45 cable to the router or switch.
2. Ensure the power supply to the M1XEP is connected to a UPS for backup.
3. If using a DSL ISP, configure the router to facilitate IP addressing for the M1XEP.

#### Connecting Devices
The M1XEP must connect to a compatible DB9F interface. Ensure to mount within the designated area provided by ELK products and power correctly using the included supplies.

#### DHCP Configuration
The M1XEP comes with factory settings configured for DHCP. If using static IPs, the configuration must align with network requirements. For DHCP settings, access the router to confirm the assigned IP matching the M1XEP's MAC address.

#### Useful Links and Updates
For firmware updates or troubleshooting, visit the ELK Products website. The M1XEP may need periodic checks to ensure it's receiving the correct IP configuration.

#### Security Measures
While accessing the M1XEP through a web browser, ensure to implement strong firewall measures to prevent unauthorized access. Secure connections using SSL are recommended for sensitive data transactions.

#### Recommendations
For enhanced security, consider using DDNS services provided by your router. Follow your router's specific documentation to enable and configure this feature. 

For installations in environments lacking stable router support, the M1XEP is compatible with various DDNS services ensuring future-proof connectivity.

### Conclusion
Following these guidelines ensures a smooth and secure installation of the ELK-M1XEP Ethernet Interface. Please consult with technical support for any specialized assistance.

To initiate a firmware release for the M1XEP, follow these steps:

1. Download the necessary firmware from the M1 website (www.elkproducts.com). Make sure you know the exact location to download and select the firmware.
  
2. Access the M1 account and navigate to the "Network" section. Click on "Firmware," then select "New Firmware" and "Ethernet." The available firmware options will be displayed.

3. Once the firmware is selected, the system will begin the updating process. **Do not interrupt or power down the unit during this process.** A light will flash during the update; if it turns off briefly, let it resume flashing. The updating process is complete once the light stabilizes.

4. The M1XEP's bootloader must be updated first, followed by the firmware. Ensure you follow the outlined procedures carefully to avoid any issues.

5. If your device is already connected to the M1, it will automatically establish a connection. To configure your network settings, input the M1XEP's IP address into your PC.

6. Use the ELK-M1XEP application to configure the settings. Click 'OK' on the following prompts, which indicate an SSL-encrypted connection is being established. 

7. You will see options regarding physical operation. Select which options to activate or restrict based on authorized users. 

8. The interface will allow you to set different functions and identify zones by their current statuses (Normal, Bypassed, Violated). It also includes sections for managing lighting (e.g., HVAC systems), where you can choose lights to control.

9. For thermostat management, select the 'Thermostat' option to view heat and cool settings for connected devices (e.g., M1ZTS or M1ZTSR).

10. Ensure that your router is set up efficiently, recognizing the assigned MAC addresses for each interface. These typically distinguish LAN and WAN connections, affecting overall network performance.

11. Understand that IP addresses can be either static or assigned via DHCP. DHCP assigns IP addresses dynamically, while static IPs will always remain the same. This distinction is important for routing and connectivity.

12. DNS and DDNS services assist in associating URLs with IP addresses, providing reliable access to resources on the network.

By adhering to these guidelines, you'll ensure a smooth firmware update and maintain the integrity of your network connections and devices.
