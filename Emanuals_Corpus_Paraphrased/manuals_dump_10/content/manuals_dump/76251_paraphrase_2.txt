To complete or remove the RINSE HOLD function, if selected, the START/PAUSE button will blink. You can either press START/PAUSE to finish the current cycle or select PUMP OUT to drain the water. Alternatively, you may choose SPIN or SHORT SPIN to proceed. At the end of the cycle, the DOOR indicator lights up, signaling when it is safe to open the door. Turn the machine off before opening. If there's an overload, the process may not complete as expected. 

Refer to the instructions for various settings, including COTTONS/LINEN and ENERGY SAVING options. Recommended settings also include PRE WASH, SOAKING, QUICK WASH, EASY IRON, STAIN, DELICATES, and WOOL. 

For maintenance, ensure the machine is clean, especially around the casing. Use a damp cloth for cleaning and avoid abrasive materials that could scratch surfaces. Regularly remove and clean the emptying hose as indicated. To troubleshoot issues such as flashing indicators, ensure the DOOR is securely closed and that the washing machine is receiving power. If problems persist, check for blockages in the hose.

If you've encountered excessive foaming or incorrect wash results, it might indicate suboptimal settings or detergent use. Follow the specific troubleshooting steps based on your machine's instructions for best practices.

For child safety, ensure the lock functions correctly and the machine is turned off when not in use. 

In terms of installation, ensure proper grounding and adhere to safety standards to prevent electrical hazards. This appliance must be connected per the manufacturer's specifications. 

For transport, handle with care to avoid damaging components or causing operational issues. 

In summary, follow all outlined instructions carefully, maintain equipment regularly, use appropriate settings, and ensure safety measures are in place for electrical connections and child access.

### Water Supply and Drainage Instructions

For proper connection and functionality, ensure that the water supply is properly plumbed and that sufficient pressure is maintained for operation.

To connect appliances, access the designated hose. If the hose needs to be removed, unscrew it from the appliance and make sure the water flow is adequately redirected. Refer to the provided guidelines for detailed steps, using the appropriate tools as indicated.

Ensure that the hose is free of kinks or obstructions to maintain optimal water flow. 

**Drainage Hose:**
The drainage hose should be installed as per the specifications. It is essential that the internal structure of the hose is maintained, allowing proper drainage without obstruction. Position the hose upright, ensuring that it remains elevated to prevent backflow.
