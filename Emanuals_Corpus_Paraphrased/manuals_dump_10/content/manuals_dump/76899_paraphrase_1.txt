For a successful and accurate installation, please follow these brief guidelines before commencing. Ensure that your setup meets all relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes. The installation instructions for the fountain should be referenced carefully.

It’s standard practice to ground electrical devices, such as telephones and computers, to water lines, either within or outside the building. This grounding may inadvertently introduce electrical feedback into the fountain, leading to electrolytic reactions that can create a metallic taste or elevate metal levels in the water. This issue can be prevented by using the specified materials. Any drain fittings provided by the installer should be plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the building's plumbing infrastructure.

**Important Notice:** All service tasks must be carried out by an authorized service technician. Note for installers regarding the EDFPVR217RC and 98409C models: To prevent breakage, a washer should be used with all mounting bolts (mounting bolts and washers are not included). 

Please ensure that your installation is compliant with ADA requirements, including proper support through blocking in the wall for mounting. The water supply should utilize unplated copper tubing, and the location for waste outlet drainage is also recommended.

To begin setup, ensure the wall is prepared for the fountain’s positioning as indicated in the rough-in guidelines. Attach the water supply and ensure it is securely connected before turning it on. Be cautious not to solder any tubes inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings.

Products must comply with specified pressure limits. Note that if water pressure exceeds the specified range, coverage under warranty may be voided. The stream height should be adjusted according to the manufacturer’s specifications. 

Routine maintenance can be performed with a soft cloth or a suitable cleaner that does not harm the fountain’s finish. Avoid abrasive cleaners or materials that could cause scratches. For cleaning and maintenance details, refer to the installation instructions for the Composite Back Panel and the ELKAY Fountains EDFPVR217RC.

**Parts List and Additional Information:** If you require parts, please reach out to your local distributor or contact Elkay Manufacturing Company. For installation guidelines concerning quick-connect fittings, simply insert the tube and ensure it is seated correctly; release it by pushing in the collet before pulling the tube out.
