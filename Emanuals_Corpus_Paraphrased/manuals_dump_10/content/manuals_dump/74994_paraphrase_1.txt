### GETTING TO KNOW YOUR OVEN
The C Selector controls the cooling process. Neon lights indicate whether the oven is on or off. Familiarize yourself with these functions for optimal use.

### GRILL AND OVEN ACCESSORIES
The supplied accessories are compatible with the cooker. Consult Service Force for replacements or troubleshooting.

### FIRST-TIME USE
Before first use, run the oven at maximum temperature (220°C) without food to clear any manufacturing residues. 

### ELECTRONIC TIMER FUNCTIONS
- **Setting the Time:** Following power-on, press the necessary buttons to set the clock.
- **Minute Minder:** To utilize the timer, hold the appropriate buttons until the desired time displays.
- **Automatic Programming:** To set the oven to turn on and off automatically, follow the prompts on the control panel.

### USING THE GRILL
Caution: Accessible parts may become hot. Keep children away during use. The grill door must remain open; failure to do so will trigger safety mechanisms causing intermittent operation.

### TELESCOPIC RUNNERS
If installed, ensure the runners are positioned correctly for smooth operation. 

---

For further information, maintenance, or repair services, please consult your user manual or contact customer service directly.

### Grill Pan and Handle

Ensure that the grill pan and handle are properly positioned, with the handle securely attached to the top of the grill pan. The food should be placed centrally beneath the heating element for optimal cooking. Adjust the pan position to the right if necessary to facilitate even cooking of the food, especially when grilling meats, which should be placed away from the direct heat source to prevent splattering.

To achieve the best cooking results, arrange foods like meats or thick items carefully on the grill. Preheat the grill appropriately before cooking; this will enhance the browning process. Foods should be turned as needed during cooking.

### Second Oven

Utilize the second oven for even cooking. It’s ideal for baking cakes and dishes at around 100°C. Please ensure the oven is switched off ('O') when not in use.

#### Important Notes for the Second Oven
Monitor the internal light for cooking status. Place dishes directly on the oven shelf, ensuring proper spacing between them to promote even heat distribution.

To allocate the oven shelves, the bottom of the shelf should fit straight into the back of the cavity. Use the telescopic runners, if available, to ensure easy access.

#### Cooking Recommendations
Avoid overcrowding the oven; allow space between dishes for proper air circulation. Avoid using rough cookware that could impede even browning.  

---

### Main Fan Oven

The fan oven provides a consistent cooking temperature. Preheat the oven to the desired temperature for efficient cooking, which typically ranges from 20°C to 25°C lower than conventional cooking methods.

#### Batch Baking Tips
Use multiple shelves for batch baking; ensure they are properly spaced to allow heat circulation. Follow the cooking chart closely, particularly for different types of baked goods.

---

### Conventional Oven

This oven setting allows you to cook without the fan function and is suitable for dishes like gratins. 

#### Important Notes for Conventional Oven Use
The light will indicate whether the oven is on or off. This oven is great for dishes needing top browning; use the right cookware to enhance this effect.

---

### Roasting Chart

Roasting times and temperatures should be adhered to ensure meat is cooked properly. 

#### Internal Temperature Guide
- 50-60°C
- 60-70°C
- 70-80°C

Choose settings between 160-180°C depending on the type of meat being cooked.

---

### Pizza Function

The pizza function is designed for cooking dishes that require a crisp, browned top. 

#### Notes for Pizza Function Use
Ensure pizzas are placed directly on the shelf for optimal results. Avoid using cookware with rough surfaces, as this can negatively impact browning.

---

### SpeedCook

This function allows for quick cooking without preheating, though some food items may require slight adjustment in cooking times.

#### Operational Notes
Monitor the status light during cooking. Allow cooling after use, as the function operates until the oven is switched off.

---

### Thermal Grilling

Thermal grilling combines top and bottom heat for effective cooking. Use this function with the oven door closed for optimal results.

#### Notes for Thermal Grilling Use
Ensure that foods are evenly spaced and check the internal light for operational status. This function is ideal for foods that require thorough cooking and browning.

By following these guidelines, you'll ensure efficient cooking across all settings of your oven.

### Hints and Tips for Cooking and Food Preparation

When cooking, ensure that food is placed around the designated "high" area and lightly covers the items. Foods should be positioned on the appropriate shelves—those directly under or below heating elements. Adjust cooking times and temperatures as necessary, typically ranging from 140-220°C, depending on the selected cooking method. 

For thermal grilling, refer to the chart indicating temperature and time for various items like rashers and whole fish. These guidelines will help achieve optimal results.

#### Defrosting
Utilize the defrost function to thaw foods without generating heat. This is particularly effective for items like cakes topped with icing. Keep an eye on the internal light during defrosting, as it indicates the status of the process. The duration required for defrosting varies based on food thickness; generally, thin or minced items take a few hours. Do not leave defrosted food unrefrigerated; cook it immediately to prevent bacterial growth.

#### Helpful Tips for Food Safety
When purchasing food, select the freshest items available and transport them directly to a refrigerated environment to avoid bacterial contamination. Adhere to cooking instructions to ensure that all food is thoroughly cooked throughout. A meat thermometer can verify that internal temperatures reach safe levels (60°C, 70°C, 80°C).

#### Care and Cleaning

**Before Cleaning:** 
Always let the cooling fan operate to cool down the oven before disconnecting the power supply. 

**Cleaning Materials:** 
Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach as they may damage the oven's finishes. Clean the exterior using non-abrasive cloths.

**Removing Wire Runners and Shelves:** 
To clean the interior, unhook runners from the top and remove them for easier access.

**Cleaning Inside the Oven:** 
Use appropriate cleaners as indicated in the instructions to maintain the oven's coating.

**Cleaning the Door Glass:** 
For maintenance, use approved non-stick cleaners. If the glass is chipped, consult customer service for replacement options.

**Replacing Inner Glass Panels:** 
Handle with care to avoid breakage. 

**Cleaning Grill and Oven Furniture:** 
These items are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.

**Replacing an Oven Light Bulb:** 
Ensure the oven is cool and powered off before replacing the bulb. Follow specific steps for safety.

### Troubleshooting
If issues arise, ensure that the cooling system is functioning, the power supply is connected, and the cooking functions are properly selected. Familiarize yourself with your oven’s manual for additional troubleshooting assistance.
