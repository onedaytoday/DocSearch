### ELSA ECOMO Technical Information

The ELSA ECOMO factory settings include various parameters determined during manufacturing, including input selection and brightness levels. Activating the RESET function restores all settings to their original state. 

For optimal performance, monitor configurations using the ELSA ECOMO should comply with EU standards, while adjusting brightness and refresh rates to improve graphical quality. Additionally, ensure proper lighting conditions to minimize glare and reflections. Utilize anti-reflective coatings on the monitor to mitigate such issues.

Seating adjustments are critical; maintain an upright posture with back support, positioned correctly relative to the screen. The recommended viewing height should be aligned with the top of the monitor. 

For maintenance, use a soft cloth for cleaning the screen and avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the device. The ECOMO monitor supports various synchronization modes, including RGB and has a specified range for brightness and color temperature settings.
