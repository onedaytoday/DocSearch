Cooking requires achieving a balanced temperature for optimal outcomes. The heat conduction of cookware should correspond with the quantity of food being prepared. It’s essential to follow the manufacturer’s guidelines to ensure that cooking is performed at the most effective temperatures. The appropriate cooking time and temperature can be influenced by food type and quantity; using a thermometer will help monitor and adjust accordingly. 

If the cooking temperature is too low, food can become undercooked and greasy, while excessive heat may overcook it, compromising texture and flavor. Optimal cooking involves using the right cookware, such as specialty items designed for specific tasks.

When operating the warmer, ensure food items remain covered for consistent heating, and avoid leaving them unattended as they may catch fire. Use heat-resistant materials and pot holders to prevent burns during food handling. Maintain proper ventilation and allow heat to dissipate safely, particularly on surfaces that can tolerate high temperatures.

When utilizing the oven, make sure to preheat appropriately, adjusting racks as necessary for even cooking. For meats and thicker items, cooking at elevated temperatures (ranging from 300°F to 550°F) will enhance browning and overall finish. Always monitor for grease accumulation, as this can lead to flare-ups.

In convection cooking, airflow is crucial for even heat distribution, and adjustments may be necessary to food quantity and type. Follow guidelines specific for convection settings to obtain desired results.

In roasting, ensure the food is properly secured, allowing for effective heat circulation while preventing grease splatter. The cooking process should adhere to recommended times and temperatures for various food types, utilizing the specified functions of the oven controls.

Finally, after cooking, food should maintain a minimum internal temperature to ensure safety; a warmer can help keep food at a safe serving temperature, reducing the risk of contamination. Always keep safety in mind when operating kitchen appliances, ensuring that children are kept at a safe distance from hot surfaces.

**Cooking Instructions**

To cook food at a low temperature, use a slow cooker or Crock-Pot. When roasting poultry, be cautious to avoid burning. The settings can be adjusted to either High (HI) or Low (LO). Cooking time varies based on the temperature, typically ranging from hours to continuous operation, depending on the selected mode. Ensure that frozen foods are fully thawed before cooking, and consider covering items to maintain moisture. Use a food thermometer to confirm doneness, especially for poultry.

Preheating may be necessary for certain cooking methods. To set the desired function on the upper cooking unit, select the appropriate setting, such as Slow Cook, HI/LO, or START. If you need to stop operation, you can press CANCEL.

**Dehydration Process**

This unit offers a dehydrating feature to remove moisture from food. The temperature range for dehydration is typically between 100°F to 225°F. To use this feature, press DEHYDRATE, followed by START. If you wish to cancel, press CANCEL.

**Bread Proofing**

For activating yeast in dough, proofing temperatures between 85°F and 100°F are ideal. Preheat the proofing area and place the dough inside a shallow pan for efficient air circulation. To start the proofing process, select the Bread Proof option on the upper unit and press START. To cancel, follow the same procedure.

**User Preferences**

The preferences menu allows configuration of various options, including Continuous or Hourly operation. To access and adjust your preferences, press USER PREF, and select the desired settings. You can turn the clock on or off and adjust the hour setup. To revert to factory settings, follow the guidelines in the preferences section.

**Cooking Functionality**

This appliance allows for cooking at various temperatures up to 450°F. Choose the Bake option on the upper unit, set the cooking time, and initiate the process by pressing START. Cooking times can be overwritten by using the MY option.

Note that the HI and LO settings are meant for the BAKE function. Functions must be activated properly to avoid errors.

**Self-Cleaning Instructions**

Before initiating self-cleaning, allow the oven to cool. Use appropriate cleaning materials and ensure safety during manual cleaning. Do not use strong cleaners or abrasives on the self-cleaning surfaces. Food residues may burn during the cleaning cycle; therefore, cleaning requires caution.

When commencing the self-cleaning process, it usually takes several hours. Press the appropriate cleaning button and follow safety instructions for completing the cycle. After cleaning, allow the oven to cool before attempting to open the door to prevent burns. If the cycle is interrupted or the door must be opened, ensure that the oven has cooled sufficiently.

### Cleaning Instructions for Appliances

#### General Cleaning
Always ensure the appliance is turned off and completely cooled before cleaning. Immediately address spills and stains to minimize the need for more extensive cleaning later.

#### Maintenance of Painted, Decorative, and Chrome Racks
Use a soft cloth for cleaning; avoid abrasive cleaners to prevent scratching. For built-up grease, apply cleaner directly to the cloth, not the surface. When cleaning, avoid using scouring pads or harsh chemicals.

#### Light Shield Maintenance
Ensure the oven is cool before cleaning the light shield. Always wear protective gloves. The shield should be in place during use to prevent damage and should only be cleaned manually. Avoid covering the light bulb with any objects while cleaning.

#### Cooktop, Burner Grates, and Heads
Clean burner grates and heads immediately after use while they are cool. Use a damp cloth and a non-scratching cleaner to remove food residues. If necessary, grates can be cleaned in the dishwasher, ensuring proper assembly afterward.

#### Safety Precautions
Before any cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and cooled to avoid burns. If any issues arise, such as the appliance not functioning properly, contact an authorized service provider.

#### Meat Cooking Instructions
For optimal results, preheat the appliance before searing meat to avoid curling. Do not overcrowd the cooking surface, and use proper cookware for even heat distribution.

#### Common Issues
If the appliance displays error codes or malfunctions, check power connections or consult the user manual for troubleshooting steps. Ensure house circuits are functioning correctly to avoid interruptions.

Follow the above guidelines for proper cleaning and maintenance to ensure the longevity of your appliance.
