**Starting the Machine:**

Press the START/PAUSE button. If the DOOR indicator flashes when START/PAUSE is pressed, it indicates the door is not properly closed. The E40 code will also flash followed by MAIN WASH notifications. To ensure proper operation, double-check that the door is securely closed before pressing START/PAUSE again. The timer counts down the hours remaining until completion. If you need to alter settings, press the START/PAUSE button again or use the DELAY TIMER, which will be displayed repeatedly.

**Selecting Wash Options:**

Different wash options will appear on the display based on your selections. The operation settings and expected time will also be visible. Adjust the settings according to fabric types—like COTTONS/LINEN, EASY-CARES, QUICK WASH at 50°C, and STAIN treatments for effective cleaning.

**Ending the Wash Cycle:**

Once the wash cycle is complete, if RINSE HOLD was selected, the START/PAUSE button will flash. To finalize the process, either turn OFF the machine or select the desired operation (DRAIN, SPIN, or SHORT SPIN) and press START/PAUSE again. If the DOOR indicator lights up, the cycle has concluded.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Regular maintenance of the machine is crucial. Cleaning the filter and drainage systems is advised, ideally performed at least once a month to ensure optimal performance. Begin by switching off the power supply before servicing. 

**Error Codes and Troubleshooting:**

If error codes E10, E20, or E40 appear, refer to the troubleshooting section to identify and resolve issues such as incorrect installation or issues with the water supply. 

**Water Supply Issues:**

Check hoses for any kinks or blockages, as well as ensure they are securely connected. Faulty hoses may require cleaning or replacement.

**Child Safety:**

Ensure that the child lock feature is activated when the machine is in use. This prevents unintended operation.

**Installation Considerations:**

The appliance should be placed on a stable surface, free of heat sources and moisture. Ensure that electrical connections meet the specified ratings to avoid potential hazards.

**Transporting the Machine:**

When transporting the appliance, use a trolley designed for this purpose to prevent damage.
