**Cleaning Instructions**

To ensure proper maintenance and longevity, allow the surface to cool before cleaning. It is essential to avoid using bleach-based cleaners, as they can damage finishes. Use non-abrasive cleaners like Brite or Brillo pads, along with a soft cloth, to clean painted or finished surfaces. Any excess cleaning product should be wiped off immediately. Note that using inappropriate cleaning materials may dull the surface finish.

**Hotplate Maintenance**

When cleaning the hotplate, ensure it is cool. If the ignition light is active, clean the crowns and other components as per your instructions. For optimal cleaning, gently scour the crowns; if they are reasonably clean, reattach them to the hotplate. Avoid forcing the crowns into place; they should fit freely. Correct placement involves positioning the crowns centrally from front to back for proper function.
