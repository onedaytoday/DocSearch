### Operating Instructions

#### General Information

The oven operates at a maximum temperature of 842°F (450°C). 

#### Igniting the Pilot Burner
To ignite the pilot burner, turn the switch (VB or HB) counterclockwise to the "High" position. Hold the switch for several seconds until the pilot light ignites. If the flame extinguishes, repeat the process.

#### Igniting the Main Burner
Press the switch (VB or HB) lightly and turn it counterclockwise to the "High" setting. This regulates the gas flow for the main burner.

#### Temperature Selection
Adjust the temperature by turning the selection dial counterclockwise from the "High" to the "Low" setting, with the lowest temperature being approximately 62°F. To increase the temperature again, turn the dial clockwise.

#### Initial Operation
Before using, preheat the oven, ensuring it reaches a steady temperature between 410°F (210°C) and 446°F (230°C). 

#### Switching Off
To turn off the main burner, rotate the switch (VB or HB) clockwise back to the "Off" position. Ensure the pilot light is also extinguished by turning the switch lightly in the same direction.

#### Cleaning Instructions
Always let the oven cool before cleaning. Use a damp cloth to remove residue from the cooking surfaces, and clean the burners with a suitable cleaner. Do not use high-pressure cleaners.

#### Troubleshooting and Maintenance
If any issues arise, such as yellow flames or inconsistent burner performance, inspect the burner for cleanliness and function. Notify technical service if malfunctions persist. 

#### Safety Precautions
Ensure the operating area is clear of any flammable materials. Follow all manufacturer guidelines for safe operation.
