### AM Black Device Overview

#### Retention of Instructions
It is essential to keep these instructions for future reference. If the appliance is transferred to another owner, ensure that all documentation is provided, along with adherence to operating guidelines to maintain functionality.

#### Safety Precautions
- **Child Safety**: Ensure children are kept away from the appliance during operation. Disconnect the power supply if it's not in use and keep the area clear.
- **Washing Instructions**: Follow the care instructions carefully. Items like clothes with buttons or zippers should not be washed if damaged, and heavy or sharp objects should be removed before washing.

#### Operating Guidelines
- **Temperature Settings**: For optimal performance, use a temperature of 60°C or 95°C depending on the washing needs. This helps minimize thermal shock to fabrics.
- **Load Distribution**: To ensure even washing, manually adjust the load if necessary, especially if items are not properly distributed within the drum.

#### Troubleshooting
If the device is not functioning correctly, consult the troubleshooting section of the manual. It may also be advisable to contact local services for recycling or scrapping the unit if needed.

#### Appliance Indicators
- **Power Indicators**: The power-on light indicates when the appliance is operating. If it’s lit after use, ensure the power is turned off.

#### Loading the Appliance
- **Fabric Types**: Sort fabrics properly before washing. Do not mix heavy and light items. White fabrics should generally be washed separately from colored items to prevent any discoloration.

#### Recommended Cleaning Agents
Choose washing detergents suitable for the fabric types. Use non-bio detergents for delicates and consider fabric conditioners to maintain softness.

Please refer to the specific notes on washing symbols and fabric compatibility in the appliance manual for detailed guidelines.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

When integrating the AM Black unit, it is essential to properly mount it at the correct height and secure it using four countersunk screws. These screws (H) should allow the front of the unit to align with the plinth. Additionally, the top must have sufficient clearance to ensure optimal functionality. If necessary, the unit can be directly secured to the front, maintaining stability and security. Proper attention to these details will ensure effective installation.
