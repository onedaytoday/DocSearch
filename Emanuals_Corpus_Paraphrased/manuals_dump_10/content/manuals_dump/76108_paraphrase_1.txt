**Technical Instructions for Appliance Operation and Maintenance**

**Appliance Setup and Electrical Connection**  
Ensure the appliance is connected to the specified electricity supply as indicated by its ratings. For appliances with a molded-on plug, use components that comply with BS1362 and meet ASTA requirements. If an extension lead is necessary, ensure it is properly rated and securely fitted to avoid disconnection. The installation should ideally be done using a fused double pole switch, either switched or unswitched, complying with NICEIC and IEE standards. 

**Electrical Wiring Notes**  
The term "double pole" indicates that both live and neutral connections are switched off, with designated terminations for supply and load. The following color codes apply: Brown for live, Blue for neutral, and Red as an alternative. Ensure the wires are connected correctly to avoid performance issues.

**Compliance with Regulations**  
It is crucial that all installations conform to national and local building regulations, especially when incorporating combustion devices such as room heaters and fires. Ensure outlets for combustion appliances are correctly managed to maintain operational efficiency.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Regularly clean the charcoal filter and ensure it is functioning correctly. The AEG charcoal filter should be cleaned every few months following the manufacturer's instructions. To clean, turn the filter counterclockwise and follow the guidelines provided. 

**Safety Precautions**  
Be cautious of overheating during operation. Switch off the appliance when not in use to prevent grease buildup, which poses a fire risk. Use appropriate cleaning agents, ensuring that any cleaning is done safely and thoroughly.
