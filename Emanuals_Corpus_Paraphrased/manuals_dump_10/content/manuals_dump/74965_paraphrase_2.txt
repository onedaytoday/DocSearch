**Paraphrased Text:**

The AOS101GAP1 model, known as the Air-O-Steam, features a cooking chamber capable of steam cooking at three different temperature settings: F-266°F, convected heat at F-572°F, and F-482°F. Each cooking method operates independently, supporting both a cooking cycle (LTC) and factory memory functions. The cooking chamber is designed with rounded corners and equipped with an IPX-5 (NEMA) rated protection, which includes a specialized hose for easy cleaning. It also incorporates built-in self-cleaning capabilities, HACCP software, and the Air-O-Clean system.

The unit comes with a two-year service warranty and one year of performance coverage from the date of installation. More information can be found on the Electrolux Professional website.

Key features include high efficiency, an easy-to-clean cooking chamber, some models offering options for additional racks or trolleys, and compatibility with both gas and LPG (ISO standards recommended). The steam generator has a rated thermal output measured in BTUs and is designed for high-capacity GN containers, simplifying access and maintenance. Specifications such as height, depth, and clearance must be adhered to ensure optimal service access and product performance. The manufacturer reserves the right to modify product specifications without prior notice.
