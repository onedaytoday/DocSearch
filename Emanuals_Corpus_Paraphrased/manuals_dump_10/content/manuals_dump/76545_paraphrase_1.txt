- **Personal Protection**: It is essential to wear appropriate safety gear, including hearing protection and fitted clothing, to avoid entanglement.
- **Environment Considerations**: Dispose of or recycle materials in an environmentally friendly manner.

#### Component Assembly Instructions

- **Tabletop Installation**: Use the specified screws (M8) to securely attach the tabletop to its stanchion.
- **Mounting the Switch**: Secure the switch plate at the front using the provided hardware, ensuring it is properly positioned for operation.
- **Suction Hose Connection**: Attach the suction hose firmly to both the machine and the waste container.

#### Final Operations Check

- Ensure all screws and components are tightened before use.
- Confirm the functionality of the ON/OFF switch and that the equipment operates according to specifications.

Following these guidelines will guarantee safe and efficient use of the TKHS E/P. Always ensure compliance with local regulations and safety standards.

The hex screw on the right side of the front is the only one that should be tightened to the right. Please consult the "Technical Specifications" for proper grounding and testing requirements. This is a three-phase system that utilizes wiring. Ensure that the shock protection (RCD) rating meets standards when connecting to the electrical supply. It is important to prevent overheating and comply with the specified wire cross-section in the "Technical Specifications."

A phase rotation check is essential; improper rotation may lead to connection issues with the outlet. Ensure the power supply is correctly assembled and switched off as needed. If the unit spins counter-clockwise instead of clockwise, reassemble it with the correct orientation. This device should only operate under the specified conditions for feeding and protection.

Do ensure that all connections are secure, as loose wires may lead to a malfunction or hazards. The device's assembly height and orientation should facilitate safe operation. 

Monthly maintenance checks should involve switching off and inspecting each component. Address any issues promptly to avoid performance degradation. Replace worn components, and always conduct operations following the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure safety.

Repair or service should only be performed by qualified personnel, and it's crucial to disconnect power before any maintenance work. Always refer to the technical instructions for specifics on operations, including sound safety measures according to DIN standards.

If hearing protection is required, follow the relevant safety protocols. For further troubleshooting, document all issues, particularly those related to overheating or performance decline, and consult the operational chapters for guidance on enhancing suction capacity or addressing chip build-up.

Lastly, ensure that all aspects, including electrical connections and dimensions, comply with safety ratings (IP) and electrical input capacities specified.
