### Paraphrased Text: SBB800T Condensing Tankless Gas Water Heater

**Product Overview**  
The SBB800T is a condensing tankless gas water heater designed for optimal performance. Adherence to safety standards is critical, as failure to follow these guidelines could lead to fire hazards, property damage, or even loss of life. It is essential to strictly follow the instructions included in order to maintain warranty coverage and ensure safe operation.

**Installation Precautions**  
It is vital to minimize risks associated with scalding and ensure you're using the heater in an environment free from the specified risks. Only use water of the required quality to maintain warranty coverage. The unit complies with ANSI Z21.10.3-2011/CSA standards, and care should be taken when selecting the installation location. Ensure proper clearance around the heater for ventilation, avoiding obstructions that could hinder combustion airflow.

**Clearance Specifications**  
A detailed clearance guideline from combustibles and termination points must be followed to avoid accidents. Ensure adequate space for installation and maintenance access, adhering to local building codes. Confirm distances from all combustibles and terminations as specified.

**Ventilation Guidelines**  
When installing venting components, use approved materials (PVC or CPVC) and adhere to height and distance requirements to prevent combustion gas buildup. Follow all dimensions related to vent terminations and ensure they are appropriately positioned to facilitate the effluent discharge.

**Dipswitch Configurations**  
The system includes adjustable dipswitches for customizing performance. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s guidelines for configuration adjustments based on the specific installation requirements, ensuring correct operation and safety.

**Final Note**  
Proper termination and connection of venting systems are essential. Regularly inspect and maintain the heater to uphold functionality and safety standards. Always refer back to the manufacturer's instructions if any questions arise regarding installation or operation.

### Water Heater Capacity and Installation Guidelines

The water heater's capacity is indicated in thousands of gallons per hour based on gravity, and this measurement is for reference only. It's crucial to ensure the water supply is fully connected for proper operation, as partial connections can lead to combustion issues exacerbated by other chemicals present in the system.

### Water Treatment Recommendations

Water treatment processes should permit periodic flushing, especially for slightly or moderately soft water. A shutoff valve for the water heater is essential to facilitate this flushing. It's recommended to have an optional treatment system in place for cold water, especially if connected to city water supply.

### Installation Precautions

When installing the water heater, ensure that the heat insulation is appropriately pitched to avoid potential issues. **CAUTION:** Do not add any additional valves to the connections at the water heater. Maintain a minimum clearance as specified in the manufacturer's instructions.

### Application Notes for Water Flow

For optimal function, the water heater should accommodate a flow switch that monitors water flow through the system, maintaining a flow rate above 85 GPM. Relay configurations should include integrated shut-off features for safety, preventing potential scalding situations. Always ensure proper plumbing, as the system must only handle potable water.

### Remote Connections and Operation Safety

When connecting a remote control unit, safety protocols must be followed to prevent system malfunction. Technicians should regularly check wiring connections for any signs of wear or issues. Ensure that all connections are secure and meet the specified electrical standards.

### Installation Components

The following components should be installed as detailed:

- **Condensate Drain**
- **Hot Water Outlet**
- **Cold Water Inlet**
- **Gas Inlet and Wiring Thoroughway**

### Product Handling

Use wall anchors correctly based on the specified location to avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ensure the longevity of components. 

Always adhere to manufacturer guidelines for installation and maintenance to ensure optimal performance and safety of the water heater system.
