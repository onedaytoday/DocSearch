Refer to the specifics regarding HBA (Host Bus Adapter) or PowerPath in both new and existing setups. Note that having no HBA connected can lead to significantly increased I/O times. It's crucial to utilize the latest patches for PowerPath from the EMC software, Navisphere, or Navisphere CLI for optimal performance. 

**Connectivity Status:** 
Ensure that the HBA is connected correctly to the switches associated with the storage systems, such as the CX500i. The functionality of SAN Copy should be verified, especially for any secondary hosts using LAN connectivity. Confirm the connection status by checking the switch LEDs for each HBA, to ensure proper linkage to every storage processor (SP). 

**Switch and NIC Configurations:** 
When configuring SANs with systems like CX200, CX300, CX400, CX500, CX600, or CX700, it's essential to monitor switch indicators for indications of connectivity issues, such as LEDs being off on both left and right indicators. Each HBA should be connected properly to the designated switches, and if required, check the configuration through the Navisphere utility.

**Setup and Initiations:**
For environments with optional CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol) security implemented, ensure that CHAP settings are consistent across all NICs and HBAs. This can be configured through Navisphere for each initiator.

**Utilizing PowerPath and VSS:**
To enhance functionality with PowerPath, attempts to use options like the Virtual Storage Stack (VSS) should be conducted carefully, ensuring compliance with the pre-defined commands. Always focus on correct LUN (Logical Unit Number) selections and I/O operations, establishing paths correctly.

**Final Checks and Command Execution:**
Conduct thorough checks using PowerPath commands to ensure paths to LUNs are established correctly and that the setup is functioning as intended. Disconnection issues should be addressed promptly, following the correct protocols to restore connections.

**Conclusion:**
Regularly monitor and maintain connectivity within your EMC environments, and leverage tools like Navisphere and PowerPath for optimal performance. Ensure firmware/software is updated and configurations are thoroughly validated for all components involved.

### Access Reference Overview for CX Series and HBA/NIC Configuration

To manage your CX300, CX500, or CX700 storage systems, you can connect to a switch or use the CX500i HBA. Utilize Navisphere for managing security settings and user access, ensuring proper connections from the HBA or NIC to the switch or Checkpoint SAN.

Check the switch's LED indicators to monitor HBA connections. If the left and right LEDs are both off, they indicate that the Storage Processor (SP) is disconnected from the switch. Proper connections must be maintained between each HBA and the switch.

Using the Navisphere CLI, you can issue commands to verify the connectivity from each HBA initiator to the SAN. Confirm the state of the Checkpoint software on the switch for proper operation. 

For enhanced security, you could implement optional CHAP settings in Navisphere, which can be applied to both existing and new HBAs. When configuring RAID settings, ensure these settings are applied consistently across your arrays.

Should you utilize PowerPath software, always ensure compatibility by following the relevant instructions. For any service interruptions or adjustments, it is advisable to engage EMC Professional Services for assistance with ATF or CDE software integration.

Connectivity checks and software revisions should be kept up-to-date to avoid performance bottlenecks in I/O operations. When performing configurations, utilize caution and refer to the appropriate commands based on your specific setup, ensuring that non-disruptive practices are followed.

Always consult the Navisphere CLI documentation for detailed commands and their implications on the configuration of your connected HBAs. The commands can be used to manage HBA types, connectivity, and overall system performance effectively.

Sure! Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a more concise and technical manner:

**Access with and without Reference**

**HBAs Connected to Switches:** The system setup includes HBAs either linked directly to switches or through CX500i switches, and connectivity to a router or switch. Each HBA connects to an individual NIC, allowing each to communicate with the SAN switches and checkpoint software for necessary utilities. The checkpoints interface with Navisphere to manage connectivity for each HBA, ensuring proper access to existing SAN switches.

**Security Configurations with CX500i:** For added security, the CX500i supports optional CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol). If a Service Processor (SP) is connected through a NIC or HBA initiator, CHAP authentication is implemented. If preconfigured, Navisphere facilitates CHAP setup for each NIC or HBA, ensuring secure communication.

**PowerPath Commands and Configuration:** Using PowerPath with Navisphere, a disconnect command may be issued to the FC4500. To restrict commands, utilize the following syntax: `class=clariion Choose LUN to Choose LUN to I/O the I/O`. The system manages I/O to LUNs effectively, maintaining command integrity.

**DMP Software Revisions:** The DMP software for systems connected to CX300, CX500, or CX700 requires specific revisions and HotFixes for optimal operation. Ensure the DMP software is compatible with necessary switches and optional software such as SAN MirrorView/A.

**Using NAVISPHERE CLI Commands:** To assign resources, utilize specified CLI commands for storage group configuration via the `arraycommpath` and ensure effective communication pathways between service processors.

**Switch Configuration and Monitoring:** Regularly check the WWPN (World Wide Port Name) and connectivity through the checkpoint switch software. Ensure that all HBAs maintain proper configurations, and revisit the VERITAS documentation for any required updates.

**Reporting Issues and Customer Support:** For troubleshooting, EMC Customer Support provides extensive documentation on detecting and resolving software issues. Collect pertinent information, including tracking ID and functional details of the software, when reaching out for assistance.
