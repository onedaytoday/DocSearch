### Technical Overview of 20GN1/1 Chilling Unit

The 20GN1/1 unit efficiently cools cooked food from +90°C down to +3°C, which aids in minimizing bacterial growth. This chilling process is crucial as it ensures food safety by allowing for storage at temperatures up to -18°C. The device operates under various modes including Soft Chilling, which can achieve cooling at +2°C, and standard chilling at +3°C or -18°C. 

Complying with NF and UK regulations, the unit includes built-in UV features (available as an accessory), defrosting capabilities, and user-friendly countdown displays that provide service information. Each operating mode (P1, P2) allows for monitoring and recording operational data, essential for HACCP compliance, especially in cases of abnormal terminations.

### Performance and Construction

The cooling process from +90°C to +3°C is executed in less than four hours, adhering to strict NF regulations regarding food handling. The construction features high-density polyurethane insulation that is CFC, HFC, and HCFC-free (using cyclopenthane). 

The unit has rounded corners for enhanced safety and ease of cleaning, and it meets ISO standards for quality manufacturing.
