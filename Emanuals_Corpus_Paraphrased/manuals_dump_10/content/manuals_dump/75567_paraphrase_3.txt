### Cooking Guidelines

**Cooking Preparation:**
Ensure food is thoroughly cooked and adjust cooking times according to the thickness and type of food being prepared. For optimal results, preheat the oven or grill as needed. Remember to turn the food as required during cooking.

**Top Oven Use:**
The top oven is primarily for baking and cooking smaller dishes like cakes and pastries, typically at temperatures around 100°C to 150°C. Make sure the top oven is operational; it will indicate when it reaches the desired temperature. Ensure that oven shelves are positioned correctly, straight, and at the back of the oven for even cooking.

**Cooking Tips for the Top Oven:**
- Roasts and dishes generally need to be cooked on a high shelf to promote even browning and reduce cleaning.
- Avoid placing dishes directly on the lower shelf to prevent over-browning.

### Main Fan Oven Operations

**Main Oven Use:**
The main fan oven heats air evenly around the food, making it suitable for larger dishes and batch cooking. Always preheat the oven for best results; this helps in reaching the desired cooking temperature effectively.

**Cooking Instructions:**
Follow the cooking temperatures outlined in the chart, typically lowering settings by about 25°C for fan-assisted cooking. When batch baking, ensure shelves allow heat to circulate freely.

### Oven Cooking Chart

Refer to the oven cooking chart for specific temperature and time recommendations based on food types. Follow spacing guidelines for optimal roasting.

### Roasting Guidelines

Follow the roasting chart carefully to achieve the desired internal temperatures, adjusting cooking times based on your preferences.

### Defrosting Feature

The defrost function is designed primarily for unwrapped items like cakes or meat. Ensure that all meat and poultry are completely thawed before cooking, and cook items immediately after thawing to avoid bacterial growth.

### Cleaning Instructions

**General Care:**
Always allow the cooling fan to operate before disconnecting the appliance from power. Use appropriate cleaners that are safe for painted finishes. Avoid abrasive materials or bleach.

**Specific Cleaning Guidelines:**
- Clean the hotplate gently, removing burnt food without scouring too hard.
- Do not remove control knobs as this may cause damage.
- Recommended cleaning methods for trays and shelves include hand washing and dishwashing where appropriate.

**Stayclean Surfaces:**
These surfaces require specific care, avoiding build-up by maintaining a temperature of around 220°C to enhance performance. 

**Cleaning Glass Panels:**
Use appropriate cleaning materials to avoid damage to glass surfaces and handles. If access is needed between the glass panels, follow the instructions to remove the outer layer carefully without damaging the appliance.

### Instructions for Glass Replacement and Maintenance

**Replacing the Outer Glass:**
To replace the outer glass, use one hand to hold the top while positioning the screws with the other hand. Ensure the screws are tightened securely with a screwdriver without risking damage to the outer glass. If the glass chips or scratches, it may lead to shattering. For further assistance, please contact Service Force.

**Cleaning the Inner Glass Door Panels:**
For cleaning, use a soft cloth and an appropriate cleaner. If heavily soiled, a suitable product like Brite can be used for thorough cleaning.

**Replacing the Oven Light Bulb:**
Ensure the oven is disconnected from the power supply before replacing the bulb. Accessing the light assembly may require the removal of shelves. Use a screwdriver to carefully detach the cover and unscrew the bulb counterclockwise. Install a new bulb by turning it clockwise to secure it tightly. Restore power to the oven and reset the clock if needed.
