### Operating Instructions for the Appliance

To initiate the hourly countdown, select the desired option. If the selected cycle expires, the display will indicate this, allowing you to PAUSE the program. To modify the settings, you need to turn the appliance OFF and then back ON. 

If the DOOR is already in use or the temperature is too high, ensure you close the DOOR carefully. If needed, switch the appliance OFF and close the door to let it cool down.
