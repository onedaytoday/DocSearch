### Defrosting Function:

The heating element should be equipped with either a twist-off or screw-on lid. Ensure that jars are placed on the shelf without touching each other. You can turn off or reduce the heat to 100Â°C for preserving soft pears, cucumbers, and beans, which should be cooked at the same temperature.
