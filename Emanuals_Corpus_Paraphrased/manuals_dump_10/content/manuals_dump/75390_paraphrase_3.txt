**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS** 
Follow safety regulations closely during installation and operation.

**PRACTICAL COOKING ADVICE** 
Utilize cooking vessels suited for efficient heating—avoid those that can easily overheat or cause spills. The electric stove features sealed hotplates designed to heat evenly and maintain temperature. Heavy-duty cookware is recommended for optimal performance.

**TRADITIONAL ELECTRIC OVEN** 
To operate the oven, adjust the settings using the thermostat and cooking functions as needed. Familiarize yourself with the operation of meat and baking settings to avoid overheating or burning.

**OVEN FUNCTIONS** 
Selector switches enable various cooking modes; refer to the manual for specific settings. The oven will automatically shut off when the desired temperature is reached, with an audible alert confirming the setting.

**ELECTRONIC TIMERS** 
Use the minute minder functions for precise cooking times. To set the time, ensure the power is on, then press the relevant buttons. Follow prompts to adjust settings as needed.

**COOKING TIPS** 
For traditional cooking, employ heat from the top or bottom as appropriate. In convection cooking, heated air circulates to promote even cooking. Optimize your cooking processes by taking advantage of multiple dishes simultaneously, ensuring efficient use of your oven's capabilities. 

Always prioritize safety and cleanliness to maximize the performance of your electric oven.

### Guidelines for Using Your Traditional Oven

**Preheating:** Make sure to preheat the oven as indicated, since this is essential for efficient cooking. For cakes, you can check doneness by inserting a toothpick; if it comes out clean, the cake is ready. 

**Cooking Meat:** When cooking meat, it should reach adequate temperatures to avoid toughness. For roasts, ensure the top is well-cooked. Meat should always be cooked at the appropriate temperature, using high heat initially to seal in moisture and then lowering it to finish cooking thoroughly. Follow specific instructions for various cuts, ensuring even cooking.

**Cooking Times:** Refer to the cooking times table for guidelines on cooking cakes, pastries, and meats based on thickness.

### Maintenance

**Cleaning the Oven:** Wipe away any splashes promptly with a soft cloth to avoid permanent stains. Use gentle cleaning products for light scratches and avoid abrasive materials. Clean plates once they cool to prevent damage.

**Care for Catalytic Sides:** To maintain catalytic surfaces, preheat empty at 220°C for a cleaning cycle of a couple of hours. This prevents buildup that could lead to more stubborn messes.

### Installation Instructions

**Compliance with Regulations:** Ensure the installation adheres to safety regulations. The manufacturer is not liable for damages resulting from improper installations.

**Initial Setup:** Upon first installation, set the oven to maximum heat while empty to ensure proper functioning and reset any initial warnings. 

### Electrical Connection

**Wiring:** Ensure correct grounding and compliance with local standards. Use specified cable types for electrical connections to prevent issues.

### Troubleshooting

If the appliance fails to operate properly, verify that it’s connected and turned on. Check fuses and wiring. If issues persist, consult technical support or authorized service centers for repairs.

By following these guidelines, you can enhance the efficiency and longevity of your traditional oven.
