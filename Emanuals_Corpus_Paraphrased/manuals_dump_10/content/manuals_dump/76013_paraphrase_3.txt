The washer’s rotating locking screw engages the sawtooth head. The sawtooth must be properly secured and released without interruption, as indicated by F1. Ensure the stop switch is set to “I” for operation, and turn it to the closed position at F3. The flow through the backpack should be even, preventing any obstruction during operation and should only be handled by authorized service personnel to maintain optimal performance with minimal wear. 

To secure the screw, turn it clockwise as shown; when turned counterclockwise, it will rotate without the desired motion. The initial operation steps should include activating the system and ensuring that the throttle remains released. Move switch F5 to the “O” (STOP) position for safety during operation, ensuring all settings are correctly configured to prevent overheating and maintain performance. 

Cleaning the equipment should take place every few hours to prevent grease buildup and facilitate thorough maintenance. Regular servicing every three months is recommended, especially for components in frequent contact, to prevent excessive wear. Ensure that the shoulder straps are adjusted to hip height for a comfortable fit.

To operate effectively, the cutting head must be maintained above ground level appropriately, adjusting the throttle for smoother operation. If wear is detected, replace the components as needed to sustain the equipment’s operational capacity. 

During usage, avoid excessive contact with the ground which can increase wear and reduce efficiency. Proper technique should be employed for each cutting operation. Follow all assembly instructions carefully to ensure safety and reliability, and refer to authorized personnel as needed for troubleshooting.
