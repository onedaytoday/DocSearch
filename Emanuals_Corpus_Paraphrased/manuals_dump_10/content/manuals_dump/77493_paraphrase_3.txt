The device has been tested and complies with FCC Class B standards. Proper installation is crucial for minimizing interference. If interference occurs, try altering the position of the clock or checking the connections.

**Setup Instructions:**
- **Unpacking:** Unpack the clock and ensure all parts are accounted for. Plug the AC cord into a 120V outlet.
- **Battery Backup System:** The clock includes a battery backup for temporary use during power interruptions. Use AA batteries as specified. 

**Control Location:**
- Key functions include settings for date/month, time, alarm, and various controls like tuning and volume.
- The upper section consists of indicators for AM, low battery, and WWVB signals, among others.

**Operating Instructions:**
The CKA1100 utilizes the atomic time signal from WWVB, provided by NIST. This signal can be received throughout the United States, but reception quality may vary based on location and environmental factors. 

**Setting the Clock for the First Time:**
Select a suitable location for optimal WWVB signal reception, avoiding interference from appliances or structures. Ensure proper connections and confirm that the battery low indicator is off before finalizing the setup.

To properly configure your clock and maximize reception, carefully follow the provided instructions. For any reception issues, you may need to relocate the device or troubleshoot further as detailed in the manual.

**Signal Reception and Clock Configuration:**

When the WWVB signal is active, the clock synchronizes with the current time and date, including seconds and month. If the signal is lost, the clock will not sync with the U.S. time. The time zone settings are as follows: Central Time Zone, Mountain Time Zone, and Pacific Time Zone. The clock will automatically adjust when the signal is restored. If the power is lost, the clock will revert to the correct time zone upon restoration.

The internal mechanism of the clock switches between AM/PM based on signal reception. The display will indicate AM or PM as appropriate. The clock can also be set manually using the DATE/MONTH and TIME buttons. Adjust these buttons to match the current month and date.

**Synchronization Method:**

The clock can synchronize with the WWVB signal automatically or manually by turning the signal switch on. This should reduce interference and enhance reception in various areas. The seconds can be counted using the TIME/SECONDS button, adjusting the month/date accordingly.

**Alarm Settings:**

The alarm feature allows you to set wake-up times for either the buzzer, radio, or both. You can toggle between these options using the ALM buttons. To activate the alarm, choose your desired setting and specify AM or PM correctly. To deactivate, switch back to OFF.

**Radio Functionality:**

To listen to the radio, press the RADIO ON/OFF button. Use the tuning knob to select your desired station and adjust the volume accordingly. Ensure that the AC cord is connected for optimal FM reception. 

**Snooze Feature:**

The Snooze function can be temporarily activated by pressing the SNOOZE/SLEEP button, allowing for additional sleep before the alarm resumes.

**Sleep Timer:**

The sleep timer feature lets you set a duration for the radio or device to play before shutting off automatically. Adjust the desired time using the SLEEP button until it displays the selected duration.

**Display Control and Maintenance:**

Adjust the brightness of the display with the DIMMER switch. To clean the device, use a soft cloth and avoid harsh chemicals or cleaners.
