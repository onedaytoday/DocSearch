**Recommendations for Cooking:**

- Position food centrally on the shelf to ensure even cooking, considering the thickness of the items being prepared. Preheat the oven to the appropriate settings for optimal results, especially for meats or while toasting.
- For even cooking, ensure food is turned as necessary during grilling. Refer to the grilling chart for specific cook times based on food thickness.

**Using the Ventitherm Fan-Assisted Second Oven:**

- This oven is designed to maintain heat evenly while cooking. It's ideal for baking cakes and cooking other dishes efficiently.
- When operating, make sure the shelves are correctly positioned to allow for unobstructed airflow. Ensure easy access by keeping the front clear.

**Second Oven Conventional Cooking:**

- Use this option for traditional cooking without fan assistance, suitable for dishes like gratins.
- Adjust the selector and preheat as required, and remember to maintain cleanliness.

**Cooking Tips:**

- Ensure food is centrally positioned to promote even cooking, particularly for items requiring rising (e.g., Yorkshire pudding). Adjust the shelf height to facilitate heat circulation.
- Choose cookware wisely; heavy or enamel dishes enhance browning. For best results, follow the cooking chart carefully.

**Rotitherm Roasting in the Second Oven:**

- This function allows for efficient cooking of various foods using closed cooking methods, maintaining moisture while achieving the desired browning on top.
- Timing is crucial; monitor the progress of food items closely.

**Fan-Controlled Defrosting:**

- This feature enables defrosting of foods without applying heat, suitable for delicate items like cheesecakes or goods with frostings.
- Monitor the defrosting process, ensuring food is cooked immediately after thawing.

**Full Width Dual Grill in the Main Oven:**

- Exercise caution as the grilling section can become very hot. Use it solely for intended purposes to avoid hazards.
- Ensure food is spread evenly to optimize cooking efficiency.

**General Oven Use:**

- Preheating is essential for achieving desired cooking temperatures; adjust settings based on the food type and follow the provided temperature guidelines.
- Utilize batch baking strategies sensibly, leaving enough space between items for proper heat circulation.

**Positioning Main Oven Shelves:**

- Shelves should be installed straight and securely to ensure stability and airflow. Always ensure the front remains unobstructed for easy access.

By applying these guidelines, you can maximize your cooking efficiency and achieve the best results in both conventional and fan-assisted ovens.

### Cooking Hints and Tips

**General Cooking Guidelines:**
- For optimal results, ensure there is sufficient space between the food and the heating element. This promotes even cooking and browning. 
- Using enamelware or heavy-duty pans can enhance browning and heat retention.
  
**Main Oven Cooking Chart:**
- Adjust temperature settings as needed, generally increasing by 10°C for different dishes. The cooking chart outlines specific temperature and shelf positions for various items, such as custards, choux pastries, and meats.

**Roasting and Internal Temperatures:**
- The roasting chart specifies recommended cooking times and internal temperatures for different meats at 160-180°C. Ensure meat is fully cooked according to the temperature guidelines provided.

**Pizza Cooking:**
- Utilize the designated pizza function for optimal cooking results. It’s important to position the pizza centrally on the cooking shelf to promote even cooking.

**Fan-Controlled Defrosting:**
- This feature allows for gentle defrosting without applying heat. Ensure that food is spaced adequately for proper airflow during defrosting. Avoid re-freezing defrosted items, and cook immediately after thawing.

**Speedcook Function:**
- This option allows for cooking without prior preheating. Adjust cooking times to reflect this change and ensure even cooking is achieved.

**Rotitherm Roasting:**
- Utilize the Rotitherm function for effective cooking of larger food items. Adjust shelf positioning based on cooking requirements and ensure proper temperature settings for desired results.
