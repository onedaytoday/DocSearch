### Paraphrased Text

**Cooking and Steaming Instructions**

Utilize the Vigorous Steam and standard heat-resistant roasting pans. Ensure that food is appropriately coated and positioned in the pans for optimal cooking. The following guidelines outline the use of steam for preparing various dishes, focusing on maintaining the integrity and type of food being cooked. If no specific instructions are provided, begin with cold ingredients.

### Vigorous Steam Use
Employ Vigorous Steam for cooking techniques such as poaching or blanching for ingredients like meat and corn, regardless of the initial state of the food (fresh or frozen). 

### Cooking Table
Refer to the Vigorous Steam Table for detailed instructions on cooking whole and chopped tomatoes, defrosting, and blanching various vegetables and meats.

### Combined Cooking
When preparing combined dishes, ensure that all components—main and side dishes—are cooked together under the Vigorous Steam function. This maintains the required temperatures, generally around 85°C for cooking and 60-63°C for meats.

### Roasting Techniques
Roasting can be effectively performed with heat-resistant pans. Always refer to the associated instructions for meat weight and cooking time. To prevent burning and sticking, periodically turn the meat and monitor the heat.

### Meat Roasting Instructions
The specific temperatures from 230°C and the appropriate closed environment should be maintained. Different cuts of meat will have unique cooking requirements, and you should rotate the food for even cooking.

### Defrosting Guidelines
For defrosting, use the Defrost/Dry function, set at 40°C. Unpack the food and place it on a plate, covering it to expedite the process. Follow the outlined methods for various types of meat.

### Drying Process
For drying food, the Defrost/Dry function will also suffice. Distribute the items evenly for optimal drying.

### Low-Temperature Cooking
When using low-temperature cooking, preheat to 120°C and follow the indicated steps until the desired cooking state is reached.

### Yogurt and Yeast Dough Preparation
Utilize specific functions for making yogurt or rising yeast dough, ensuring they are covered and maintained at 40°C to achieve desired results.

### Preserving Techniques
Employ steam for preserving food in jars, ensuring they do not touch to avoid uneven cooking. Follow the guidelines provided for various fruits and vegetables.

### Cleaning Instructions
For cleaning, use a soft cloth and avoid high-pressure cleaners. For stubborn buildups, the Vigorous Steam clean function may also be employed. Ensure the appliance is turned off and cool before cleaning.

### Light Maintenance
To replace the light bulb, ensure the appliance is disconnected. Use a screwdriver to unscrew and replace as necessary.

By following these instructions, you can achieve optimal results for cooking, roasting, steaming, and preserving food.
