If recirculating, follow the instructions below for handling the charcoal. Ensure you manage the charcoal correctly, using the designated locations for each component. The charcoal should be positioned within the housing, ensuring optimal placement for extraction. Proper installation of ducting is critical; avoid tight turns that could hinder airflow, as this can impact performance. It is advisable to reduce bends in the ducting to maintain efficiency.
