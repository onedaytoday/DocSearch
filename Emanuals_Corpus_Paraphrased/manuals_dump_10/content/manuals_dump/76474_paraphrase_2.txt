### Removal of Stock Exhaust:
1. Cut your stock exhaust just in front of the muffler after the weld, leaving all rubber grommets attached to the hangers.
2. Use WD-40 to facilitate the removal of the exhaust and hangers.

### Installation Steps:
1. **Headpipe Installation:** Attach the headpipe to your existing stock front pipe and secure it using Clamp F. **Note:** Do not tighten yet.
  
2. **Muffler Installation:** Install the muffler onto the headpipe with the louvers facing the converter. Support the muffler with a jack stand. Secure the muffler to the headpipe using Clamp G. **Note:** Do not tighten yet.

3. **Band Clamp:** Place Band Clamp H onto the muffler and insert the welded hanger into the rubber grommet, then tighten the band clamp using Hardware Kit I.

4. **Overaxle Tailpipe Installation:** Insert the overaxle tailpipe into the muffler and secure it with Clamp G. **Note:** Do not tighten yet.

5. **Turnout Pipe Installation:** Attach the turnout pipe to the tailpipe and secure them together with Clamp G. **Note:** Do not tighten yet.

6. **Adjust Exit Pipe:** Position the exit pipe at the correct angle for your truck and insert the welded hanger into the corresponding grommet. Install the stainless steel tip and secure it with a clamp.

### Final Steps:
Once all components are in place, thoroughly tighten all bolts and clamps to ensure a secure fit. To clean the stainless steel tips, use any stainless steel cleaner and a Scotch Brite pad.
