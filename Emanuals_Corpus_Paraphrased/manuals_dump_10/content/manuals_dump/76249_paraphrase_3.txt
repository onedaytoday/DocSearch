### Instructions Overview

To start the washing machine, press the **START/PAUSE** button. If the **DOOR** indicator flashes, it means the door is not securely closed. The **E40** error will also flash if this is the case. Ensure the door is closed properly and press the **START/PAUSE** button again. 

If the **DELAY TIMER** option is repeatedly displayed, it indicates that the timer is set. You can adjust this without interrupting the selected program.

While the program is running, the elapsed time will be displayed, and the machine may correct the cycle based on the load type. To pause the cycle, press the **START/PAUSE** button, and you may select options like **PUMP OUT**, **SPIN**, or **SHORT SPIN** by turning the dial accordingly.

When the cycle is complete, if you selected **RINSE HOLD**, the **START/PAUSE** button will flash. To unlock and open the door, either complete the cycle or choose **PUMP OUT**. Always turn off the machine after use.

### Program Options

Different wash settings are available based on fabric types. For **COTTONS/LINEN**, a temperature of 40°C is generally effective for removing stains. **EASY-CARES** settings help with minimizing creasing in shirts.

### Maintenance Instructions

Regular cleaning of the machine is necessary. Wipe down surfaces and ensure that cleaning materials do not contain abrasives or scouring agents. Always check the manual for proper cleaning procedures when maintaining any components of the machine.

### Troubleshooting

If an error appears (E10, E20, or E40), refer to the troubleshooting section. Common issues include door closure problems or a blocked hose. If **RINSE** or other wash indicators are flashing, check the hose connections for any issues.

Ensure that the washer is turned off and unplugged while performing maintenance. Instructions for emergency emptying and removal of the entrance cover can be found in the manual.
