Here's a technical paraphrase of the provided text while maintaining its meaning:

---

The absorption mechanism may inadvertently close if the appliance is left unattended, leading to mold build-up and inadequate cooling. To maintain proper function, it is essential to adjust the temperature settings to the optimal warmer or cooler tone as required. The appliance will indicate when the desired temperature (C) is reached. In the event of a closure during operation, the system will equalize temperature automatically.

Warnings and notifications are in place for temperature fluctuations. An acoustic warning will activate if temperatures exceed a certain threshold, and it may sound for several seconds if food needs rearranging or if the door is ajar. This warning can be silenced by switching off the system. The system will also automatically deactivate warnings when the closure is registered. The acoustic alert will reactivate if the internal temperature rises above a specific point, indicating food spoilage risks.

To optimize internal conditions, food items should be properly stored according to type and height. The shelves are adjustable, and the trays are designed to accommodate specific bottle sizes to maintain stability and prevent spillage. The lowest shelf is ideal for meat and poultry items, aiming for a temperature below C. A thermometer can be used to monitor conditions effectively.

Proper food storage practices are essential. All items should be appropriately covered to prevent cross-contamination. Fresh food must meet specific guidelines, and exceeding storage limits may require the FROSTMATIC feature to be activated, ensuring items are frozen adequately within specified hours. Should temperatures rise excessively, the FROSTMATIC function can be deactivated manually.

Defrosting should occur periodically as frost accumulates, typically at least once a year or as necessary. Turning off the appliance during this process is recommended, as is the careful removal of frost to avoid damaging internal components. Regular maintenance will improve performance and energy efficiency.

Additionally, ensure proper cleaning protocols are followed when servicing the appliance. This includes disconnecting it from the electrical supply, using suitable cleaning agents, and ensuring all components are thoroughly cleaned and dried. Caution is advised when handling cleaning chemicals.

In case of operational issues, potential causes could include frost build-up, malfunctioning components, or improper food placement. For persistent problems, contacting customer support or referring to the troubleshooting section is advised.

The unit is designed in compliance with relevant household regulations and directives, ensuring safe and effective operation. Consumers are encouraged to follow the user manual for optimal use and maintenance, including warranty details. Compliance with EU safety standards guarantees appliance reliability.

For any issues related to service or repair, contacting authorized service personnel is necessary to avoid invalidating warranties or service agreements.
