Chilling cooked food from +90°C to +3°C effectively reduces bacterial growth, while bringing the temperature down to -18°C allows for extended storage. This process enables food to be held at these temperatures for several months. The system operates in various modes, including soft chilling (to +2°C) and rapid chilling (to +3°C or -18°C). Each mode is managed by the ARTE system, which continuously monitors cooling progress in compliance with NF and UK regulations. The unit is equipped with UV light (optional), a defrosting feature, and displays to provide countdowns and service information, with an operating range up to +32°C.

The chilling performance efficiently cools food from +90°C to +3°C within a four-hour timeframe. Construction includes AISI stainless steel and high-density polyurethane insulation with HCFC-free materials. Additional standard features include HACCP compliance, optional printer connectivity, temperature sensors, and customized configurations for various GN sizes.

Other specifications encompass hygienic design elements, rounded corners, IP20 protection, and a user-friendly cleaning process. It includes a thermostatic heating defrosting option and can be installed either as plumbed or using a collected drainage system. Compliance certifications from AFAQ AFNOR ensure consistent hygiene and thermal performance.
