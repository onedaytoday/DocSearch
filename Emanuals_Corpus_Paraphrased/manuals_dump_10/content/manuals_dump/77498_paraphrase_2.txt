**Repeat Playback**
To enable continuous tracking of a selected track, press the REPEAT button on the front panel once. The REPEAT indicator will blink. If necessary, use the PLAY/PAUSE button to initiate playback. The chosen track will then play in a continuous loop. For repeated playback of multiple tracks, press REPEAT on the front panel again to activate it. If needed, use the PLAY/PAUSE button to start playback. To exit this mode, you can either stop playback by switching functions or turn the power off.

#### Programmed Playback
To utilize programmed playback, begin by pressing the STOP button and following the steps outlined below. Press the PROGRAM button on the front panel; the PROG indicator will flash, and the track number will also blink. Use the SKIP FWD or SKIP REV buttons to select the first track to be programmed. The program memory will store each selected track. After programming, press the PLAY/PAUSE button to start playback of the programmed tracks. When the playback ends, the system will display the next track in the memory. To clear the program, use the STOP button while in PROGRAM mode, or turn the power off.

#### Alarm Function
To set the alarm function, press the ALARM button on the front panel as needed. This can be used to wake you with either a buzzer or music. The ALM indicator will appear when activated.

To hear music in the morning, ensure the alarm is set to MUSIC and the ALM indicator is visible.

#### Important CD Note
Ensure that the chosen CD is compatible, as the Table of Contents (TOC) must be read within seconds. If the TOC is not read correctly, playback issues may occur.

For more options, toggle the ALARM feature by pressing the STOP or ALARM buttons.
