Black garments and additives should be selected based on the recommendations for laundering and the intended appearance of clothes and household items. This includes both whites and colored fabrics, with specific guidance for non-biological detergents such as Fairy for cleaning. For delicate items, specialized laundry bleaches should be used, and heavy-duty stain removers like Vanish In-Wash or GloWhite are suitable for tough stains.

Traditional laundry powders and liquids can be applied directly to clothes, while compact formulas come with precise measurement guidelines on their packaging. Fabric conditioners are designed to enhance the ease of care for various textiles. Users must follow the instructions on these products, particularly when using items like MAX Bounce sheets.

When drying, loads should not exceed recommended limits, especially for synthetic materials that can be flammable. Certain items can lead to issues if not treated carefully. 

The drying cycle will adjust based on the type of laundry and its condition, typically indicated via a control chart. For example, normal drying can be adjusted, and towels should be dried thoroughly. Additionally, to avoid creasing, it's recommended to distribute items evenly within the drum.

When operating the washing machine, pressing the appropriate buttons will activate specific features like STAIN-Action or PREWASH options, which can be monitored through indicator lights. The DELAY START function will clarify the countdown until the cycle begins.

During operation, if the RINSE HOLD feature is selected, relevant lights will indicate the current phase. Users should ensure that all options are properly set before starting the machine. 

To drain water, follow the instructions carefully to avoid clogging the hose. In case of any issues, such as unusual noises or error codes (E10, E20, etc.), follow the troubleshooting guide, which includes checking water supply and ensuring hoses are clean and unobstructed.

Always ensure the machine is reset and powered off as needed, especially when performing maintenance tasks or troubleshooting issues.
