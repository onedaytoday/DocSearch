### Instructions

**Using the Function:**
After selecting a cooking function, ensure the food is preheated and only engage the function when necessary. For **CONVENTIONAL** cooking, press the button to activate. Once the pre-set temperature is reached, an acoustic signal will sound, indicating the function is active. The function automatically turns off once the cooking time is complete, or can be switched off manually at any time.

**Setting Cooking Time:**
The cooking duration can be programmed using the **COOK TIME** feature. If required, adjust the clock settings as often as needed. The displayed time will blink for confirmation. After setting, the clock will automatically switch off when the designated time elapses, accompanied by an acoustic tone.

**Countdown Functionality:**
The **COUNTDOWN** feature can be adjusted by pressing the clock button repeatedly to initiate or alter countdown settings. Once the countdown time reaches zero, it will alert you with an acoustic sound and then automatically extinguish.

**Lighting Control:**
The lighting turns on and off manually using the lighting switch. If the clock is inactive, it displays the last used function setting, turning off automatically after a short duration of inactivity.

**Child Safety Lock:**
Activate the child lock function to prevent unauthorized adjustments. When engaged, any attempt to override will trigger a confirmation alert and display "SAFE." Deactivating the lock is accomplished by pressing the designated buttons for a few seconds.

**Cooking Instructions for Various Functions:**
- **Baking Cakes and Pizzas:** Use the appropriate shelf levels when baking. Preheating is recommended for optimal results.
- **Roasting:** Utilize heat-resistant dishes and choose the right function for the type of meat being roasted. This helps avoid cross-flavors if roasting multiple items simultaneously.

**General Cooking Tips:**
Refer to the manual for detailed cooking times and adjustments per dish type, ensuring the proper placement of items in the oven for best results. 

Should you need additional guidance, consult the tips provided for each specific cooking function along with the standard operational settings.

### Poultry and Meat Cooking Guidelines

**Cooking Poultry and Meat:**
For cooking poultry or certain meats, refer to the preheating guide and position the shelf according to the specified chart. Utilize the **ROTITHERM FAN COOKING** function, selecting the appropriate temperature (e.g., 300째C for grilling). Ensure you monitor quantities and place food accordingly to achieve optimal results. 

**Grilling Instructions:**
1. Preheat the grill to 300째C.
2. Arrange the meat on the designated shelf.
3. Use higher settings if required.
4. Pay attention to the cooking times based on food type and quantity.

**Bio-Function Roasting:**
Applying the ROTITHERM function while roasting is more efficient than conventional roasting. This method optimizes heat distribution, especially for thicker cuts of meat. Adjust heat settings as necessary and follow the accompanying notes for accurate temperature and cooking times.

**Yoghurt and Dough Preparation:**
For yoghurt or dough, utilize the **CONVENTIONAL function**. Bring temperatures down for cooling to the appropriate degrees. Ensure proper covering of items on the shelf and follow the outlined instructions carefully.

**Drying and Defrosting:**
To dry items like fruit, employ the **FAN COOKING function**. Adjust temperatures appropriately; for instance, set to 60째C for effective results. For defrosting, utilize the **DEFROST function** and avoid covering food to ensure even thawing.
