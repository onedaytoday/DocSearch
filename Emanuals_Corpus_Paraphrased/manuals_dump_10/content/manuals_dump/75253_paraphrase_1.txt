### THE SECOND OVEN

The second oven is designed to heat the top and bottom for efficient cooking. It is particularly useful for baking cakes and other items at around 100°C.

**Using the Second Oven:**
- Switch it on by turning the dial to 'O'.
- The oven will indicate when it has reached the desired temperature and will cycle on and off during cooking to maintain this temperature.

**Key Notes:**
- The internal light will illuminate when the oven is operational.
- Ensure dishes or food are placed directly on the shelf for optimal heat distribution.

**Adjusting the Second Oven Shelf:**
- The cranked shelf needs to align straight with the back of the oven. 
- Make sure the front of the shelf is clear to avoid any obstruction.

**Hints and Tips:**
- Position food centrally on the shelf to promote even cooking; for cakes and Yorkshires, it's best to leave space around them for heat circulation.
- Avoid overcrowding, especially with meat, as this can lead to uneven browning.
- Use appropriate cookware: enamelware, heavy, or non-stick options enhance browning, while polished surfaces help distribute heat evenly.

### DEFROSTING

**Overview**  
The defrost function is designed to thaw foods using ambient temperatures, ensuring that items like cheesecakes or foods with icing are not compromised. 

**Using the Defrost Feature**  
When utilizing the defrost feature, note that the appliance will turn on and off automatically. The internal light will assist you during the defrosting process. Factors such as the food's temperature can influence the efficiency of defrosting. For optimal results, consider using this function for meats, especially thinner cuts, which typically require only a few hours to thaw fully.

**Important Considerations**  
Food should be cooked thoroughly immediately after defrosting. Do not refreeze items that have been defrosted without cooking or those that have cooled down.

### Helpful Tips for Buying and Preparing Food  
To minimize bacterial growth, ensure that proper food handling guidelines are followed when purchasing, reheating, and defrosting food items. Choose the freshest products from reputable sources and transport them insulated. Follow cooking instructions meticulously to ensure thorough heating throughout, especially for food cooked from a frozen state. Meat should be checked with a thermometer to ensure it reaches the appropriate internal temperature upon cooking.
