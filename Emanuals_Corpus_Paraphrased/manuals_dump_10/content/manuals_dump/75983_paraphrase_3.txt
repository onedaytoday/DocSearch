### Model Codes: ZKR1516, ZKR1506, ZKR1526 Technical Guidelines

#### Important Information 
This document provides essential instructions and warnings for the safe operation and features of the units. It is crucial that anyone using these appliances understands how to operate them properly, as misuse can lead to severe hazards, especially for children and individuals with limited physical or cognitive abilities. 

#### Safety Warnings
- **Risk of Suffocation:** Ensure that children are kept away from the appliance to prevent accidental suffocation.
- **Electrical Shock or Fire:** Avoid using the appliance in conditions that could lead to short-circuits or overheating. Ensure the unit is not placed near heat sources and that cords are in good condition to prevent electrical hazards.
- **Cleaning Precautions:** Always disconnect from the power supply when cleaning and regularly remove frost buildup to maintain efficiency. 

#### Installation Guidance
- Upon unpacking, let the appliance stabilize for at least four hours before connecting it to the power supply to avoid overheating.
- Position the unit such that it does not obstruct airflow, and avoid using it in excessively damp or sunlight-exposed areas.

#### Operational Setting
- Adjust the thermostat according to the food types stored. For freshness, warmer settings are suitable for certain items while colder settings are required for others.
- When loading fresh food, allow space for air circulation. 

#### Maintenance 
- Regularly clean internal components, focusing on the cooling mechanisms and surfaces. Only use authorized cleaning agents to preserve the appliance's integrity.
- Defrosting should be done when frost thickness reaches approximately 1/4 inch to ensure optimal functionality.

#### Troubleshooting
If abnormal sounds or operational issues arise:
- Verify power connections and appliance settings.
- Investigate possible overheating or airflow blockages and rectify accordingly.

#### Technical Specifications
Refer to the internal rating plate for specific operational limits, optimal temperature settings, and performance instructions, specifically within the ranges:
- **SN:** +10°C to 32°C
- **ST:** +16°C to 38°C
- **N:** +16°C to 43°C 

Ensure adherence to all operational and maintenance protocols to ensure the longevity and efficiency of the appliances.

To achieve optimal performance, the heat source—such as boilers or sunlight—should be positioned at the back of the location. Ideally, it should be below or behind the unit to facilitate airflow and ensure sufficient space for the shelves. 

For operations involving adjustments, it is important to follow the guidelines carefully. 

**Warning:** Disconnect the unit from the power supply before proceeding to avoid hazards. This allows for safe handling of components.

To adjust the setup:
1. Unscrew the screws located at the back and top of the unit, observing the direction indicated by the arrows.
2. Ensure all screws are properly tightened to secure the components.
3. If misaligned, remove both screws from the back and top, then re-insert as indicated.

For further service adjustments, allow at least four hours for repositioning and to maintain reversibility.

Ensure that the electrical supply is grounded for safety. If grounding is not available, consult guidelines for proper handling as per E.E.C. directives related to health and safety. 

For information on recycling or return procedures, contact your local service provider or the retailer where the unit was purchased.
