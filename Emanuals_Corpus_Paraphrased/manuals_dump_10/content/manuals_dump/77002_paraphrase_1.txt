**Connection Overview:**
Connect the DC OUT to the ELMO (HD-80XG) and the LCD (LM-5011N). The unit features AC IN, INPUT RS-232C, UNSWITCHED OUTLET (MAX. 3.2A), DC IN, and DC OUT at 12V. Use the supplied DC for HD-80XG/LM-5011N; for other devices, connect to the DC OUT to INPUT RGB1 or INPUT RGB2. The HD-80XG supports RGB OUT along with OUTPUT S-VIDEO (12V, 0.9A).

**Operating Procedures:**
To start, turn ON the switch. The LED on the front panel indicates the operational status of each function. If the switch is turned ON and then immediately OFF, restart it after a few seconds. Use the [TELE] and [WIDE] buttons or wireless remote for adjustments. Press the [AF] button on the front or remote to focus. Wireless operation is enabled, allowing for overhead projections.

To deactivate the baselight, press the [BASE] button on the front panel or via the remote. For shooting purposes, adjust accordingly based on the subject. For wireless setups with optional LCD attached, ensure to turn OFF the switch before detaching or pressing the release button.

**Lighting Functions:**
Various lighting capabilities, including 3-D options, can be activated using the [UPPER] or [BASE] buttons. After a few seconds, the lights can be switched OFF using the corresponding buttons. The lighting is designed to operate when power is ON. Ensure that lighting requirements are adequate for presenting high-quality visuals or 3-D effects. When connected to devices like the ELMO [HD-80XG], select the appropriate AV input via [INPUT] [RGB1] or [INPUT] [RGB2] without pressing the input selection buttons directly. The built-in [MAIN] button also resumes previously selected settings.

The output is selectable between NTSC and PAL formats. Pressing the [RGB1/RGB2] button will switch between corresponding inputs, while the built-in [MAIN] button allows for adjustments based on NTSC/PAL requirements.

**RS-232C Specifications:**
Connect a PC using the RS-232C [RS-232C] port. Ensure that the connection is secure and follow the command structure for proper operation. Various commands are available for controlling functions such as Iris, Lighting, and input selections.

**Troubleshooting:**
If there are issues, check these common symptoms:  
- Ensure the TV is properly connected.  
- The AC power must be supplied and the unit turned ON.  
- If the switch turns OFF immediately, try waiting a few seconds before retrying.  
- Check focus settings if the image quality is poor, particularly between TELE and WIDE modes.  
- Ensure that NTSC/PAL settings align with the device requirements; refer to the relevant section for switching instructions.  
- For persistent issues, consult authorized ELMO service.
