### Child Safety Device
**Activating the Child Safety Device:** To activate the child safety lock, ensure the main oven is off. Turn the selector dial until the "SAFE" indicator is visible, confirming activation.

**Deactivating the Child Safety Device:** To deactivate, turn the selector dial until "SAFE" is no longer displayed, allowing the oven to function normally.

### Oven Safety Cut-Out
The oven will automatically shut off if it is left on for an extended period at certain temperatures (120°C after 3 hours, 200°C after 2 hours, and 250°C after 1 hour), and the safety light will flash.

### Full Width Dual Grill
**Warning:** Accessible parts may get hot during grill use, so keep children at a distance. Preheating may not be necessary, depending on the cooking method. 

**Using the Full Width Dual Grill:** Select the grill function and set the dial accordingly. Turn the dial right to adjust the temperature between 110°C and 150°C.

### Grill Pan and Handles
Ensure the grill pan is securely positioned on the shelf. Place food centrally on the shelf to ensure even cooking and prevent splattering.

### Hints and Tips
When grilling, allow for varying food thicknesses to achieve proper cooking results. Take care to reduce splatter, and try to cook foods with similar sizes together for optimal results.

### Second Oven
The second oven can be used independently for various baking tasks, such as cakes and pastries, by turning it on and setting the appropriate function. 

### Tips for Oven Shelves
Shelves should be inserted ensuring they are level and securely in place. When using telescopic runners, ensure they are properly aligned.

### Conventional Cooking
This method allows for manual cooking techniques without automated functions. Adjust the cooking temperature and ensure even distribution of heat. 

### Main Oven Cooking Guidelines
Refer to the specific cooking chart for optimal settings and times for different foods, ensuring that adequate spacing is maintained between dishes for proper airflow and browning.

### Roasting Chart
Follow the recommended internal temperatures and cooking times for various meats, ensuring they are spaced correctly within the oven.

### Full Width Grill Usage
Use the grill carefully, monitoring time and temperature as indicated. Adjust cooking durations based on the desired outcome for different types of food.

### PIZZA

**Overview**: Pizza is essential for various culinary applications. The top layer requires the pizza to be set at 150°C, with a specific cooking duration confirmed in seconds. Ensure that the temperature is reached before proceeding.

**Important Notes**: When setting the cooking function, make sure to select the appropriate option to achieve the desired temperature. You will hear a sound indicating that the set temperature has been reached. Once the cooking is complete, the oven will switch off automatically, allowing the food to cool.

**Tips**: For optimal cooking, position the food centrally on the shelf, avoiding direct placement on the bottom tray to ensure even cooking and browning. Relying on enamelware, heavy, or non-stick trays can improve browning results.

### ROTITHERM ROASTING

**Functionality**: Rotitherm Roasting is designed for cooking foods typically associated with conventional roasting techniques, while maintaining a closed environment. This feature helps achieve even cooking.

**Guidelines**: Set the temperature to 180°C and confirm the selection. Similar to pizza, monitor the sound cues to know when the set temperature has been reached.

**Tips**: Make sure to place food on the specified shelves to ensure thorough cooking. Adjust cooking times as necessary for different dishes, like shepherd’s pie, ensuring even heating.

### SPEEDCOOK

**Operation**: The Speedcook function allows rapid preheating. Ensure the set temperature is reached before beginning cooking.

**Selecting Speedcook**: Choose the desired cooking function, and confirm to initiate the process. Keep track of the indicator lights to monitor when the set temperature is achieved.

### FAN CONTROLLED DEFROSTING

**Purpose**: This function defrosts food without applying heat, ensuring more delicate items (like cakes or cheesecakes) aren't damaged.

**Usage**: Confirm the choice for defrosting and set to 30°C. This feature allows for a gradual and thorough thawing process.

**Tips**: To maintain food safety, cook defrosted items immediately after thawing to prevent bacterial growth. Regularly check the progress of foods to ensure they thaw evenly.

### CARE AND CLEANING

**Pre-cleaning Protocol**: Allow the cooling fan to operate until the appliance cools down before disconnecting from the power supply.

**Cleaning Guidelines**: Use appropriate cleaners that won't harm finishes—avoid bleach or abrasive materials. For exterior cleaning, utilize soft cloths to prevent damage.

**Maintaining Wirework Runners**: Remove shelves by unhooking them from their supports and clean accordingly.

### CLEANING THE OVEN INTERIOR

**Surface Maintenance**: The back and interior surfaces are coated with a self-cleaning finish and should be cleaned manually. Follow cleaning instructions carefully and avoid harsh chemicals.

**Door Glass Care**: Regularly clean the inner and outer panels with suitable materials. If damaged, consider professional service for glass replacement.

### REPLACING LIGHT BULBS

**Procedure**: Disconnect the appliance from the power supply before replacing light bulbs. Use the correct type rated for high temperatures and follow proper disassembly guidelines.
