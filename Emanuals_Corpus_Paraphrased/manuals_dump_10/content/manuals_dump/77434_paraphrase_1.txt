**Remote Mounting and Configuration Instructions for MAN-0076 II Inc.**

For remote installation, ensure that JP1 and JP2 are properly mounted on the designated board. The terminals associated with these jumpers should be disconnected prior to modification. When connecting the wires, refer to the following terminal configuration: White wire for +Vdc, Black wire for Earth, and the corresponding terminals for RST and COM for channels CH1 and CH2, which will enable isolated 4-20mA signal output.

If relays are designed to latch, a normally open push-button switch connected to RST and COM can be used for operation. For separation and mounting instructions, adhere to the guidelines in Section MAN-0081 for remote installations. Ensure all connections conform to the specified standards to maintain safety and functionality.

Refer to Table C for termination and supply specifications, and the operational guidelines in Instruction MAN-0109, especially when using protective measures like splash guards. Proper grounding and shielding are crucial for reliable operation.

The device's LED indicators will assist in determining operational status, such as %LEL or PPM readings. If disabled, the LED will indicate this status through specific ON/OFF patterns. The operational mode requires careful selection via the provided switches to navigate through functional options.

The configuration processes outlined involve navigational switching to assign functions effectively. Using the interface, users can select between self-test options and assign specific settings thoroughly described in the accompanying tables. 

Proceeding with functionality selection necessitates pressing the respective buttons, with timely enforcement of commands enabling the chosen settings. Any unselected options will automatically exit the operational mode after a brief period of inactivity.

To monitor and calibrate readings for CH1 and CH2, users will engage specific sequences as highlighted in the operational charts. If adjustments are required, ensure prompts are followed as described, with a specific focus on maintaining the integrity of the setup.

Managing relay configurations will involve similar navigational prompts to assign High and Low settings as needed. The relays (RL1, RL2, RL3) can be toggled between different states, such as latching or non-latching, according to the specified functional requirements.

For further assistance, consult the tables and sections provided throughout the MAN-0076 II documentation to confirm relay assignments and their corresponding operational statuses. Follow these protocols strictly to ensure optimum performance and safety of the system.

### II Assignment Overview

The system includes multiple alarm relays: RL1, RL2, and RL3, each with specific configuration points (CH1 and CH2). The user can set up conditions for these relays, such as "Below-Below," "Below-Above," depending on the application's operational requirements. The interface allows users to select parameters, including alarm thresholds and language preferences (available in English, Spanish, and French).

#### Relay Configuration and Operation

Users can activate various options by pressing designated switches. The configuration allows setting up of alarm relay addresses and communication formats (MODBUS Addressing includes EVEN, ODD, and NO Parity). The system supports self-testing of relays to ensure they operate as intended. If a relay malfunctions, testing will generate warning signals to indicate service is required.

#### Functional Alerts

The system continuously monitors the operational status of the relays, with feedback provided through LED indicators. Different configurations can trigger alerts for conditions such as high voltage or memory faults. The relays are rated for both AC and DC operations, and users can reference specific assignments to link functionalities accurately.

#### HART Communication

HART connectivity enhances the II for users who require additional functionality. Connections to HART devices are made through designated terminals, ensuring comprehensive integration with existing systems. 

#### Installation and Maintenance Recommendations

Installation should ensure environments are free from contaminants and any required separation. It’s advisable to maintain proper documentation of installations and maintain a clear line of communication for troubleshooting and service needs. Any issues that arise should be addressed promptly following operational guidelines to ensure system reliability.

#### Service and Support

For assistance, users are encouraged to contact authorized service channels, providing necessary details for efficient processing. Collect shipments are not accepted, and the return of items must be pre-approved.

### Conclusion

This document encapsulates the operational guidelines and specifications for configuring and maintaining the II system. It is critical to follow these standards to ensure functionality and longevity of the equipment.

A: **Electrostatic Sensitive Device (ESD) Definition**: An ESD refers to the electrical charge that can be generated or induced by a field. Physical contact with an ESD can lead to instantaneous malfunctions due to this charge. To mitigate ESD risks, it is essential to follow proper procedures, which include utilizing grounded wrist or foot straps and ensuring that all personnel are educated and trained in ESD protocols, as outlined in MAN-0076 by II Inc.

B: This should be indicated when closed according to MAN-0076 specifications by II Inc.
