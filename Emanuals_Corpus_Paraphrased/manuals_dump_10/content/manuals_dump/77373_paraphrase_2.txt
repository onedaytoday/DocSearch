**Specifications and Preparation for Troubleshooting the Water Fixing System**

Please adhere to these specifications when preparing the Water Fixing system. Ensure that earthing connections are consistently performed, as they are crucial for user safety. Compliance with these standards is necessary; neglecting them may result in operational failures.

For connection, use a reliable single-phase three-prong receptacle. Proper earthing is essential for safe operation. Preferably, utilize a surge protector. Technicians should ensure the system is clean and that the bathroom environment is maintained for ease of access.

Take care to avoid placing heavy items on or around the system, as well as preventing children or handicapped individuals from mishandling controls. Avoid using small objects like hairpins near the device. Protect it from solvents and direct sunlight, as exposure can damage components.

When dealing with the hoses, visually confirm that their condition meets the required specifications. Ensure hoses are not obstructed and maintain appropriate height for optimal performance. If issues arise, inspect the installation location and cabinet alignment.

**Preparation Steps**

1. Remove hairpins and other foreign objects before operating the hose.
2. Confirm that grounding is secure.
3. Perform functional checks, especially on buttons.

When using cleaning agents like bleach, ensure they are appropriate for the material being treated. The thickness of the fabric will influence the system's capacity, so avoid overloading. When introducing bleach, do so in moderation and avoid direct contact with components.

Follow the specified program for various fabric types, and avoid twisting cloth that may become excessively soiled. 

**Troubleshooting Guidelines**

If you experience irregular sounds or issues with the cord, power down the system and conduct inspections as needed. If problems persist, refer to the user manual for guidance on resolution.
