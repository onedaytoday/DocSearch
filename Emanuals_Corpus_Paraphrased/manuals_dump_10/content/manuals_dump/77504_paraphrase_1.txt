To manually adjust the clock settings, users can navigate through the time and alarm settings using the designated buttons. Users can hold these buttons down to modify the time or alarm settings, and any changes will be saved into memory. If the adjustment process is interrupted, it can be resumed upon restoration of power. The clock operates independently, allowing users to set both alarms and timers. 

To enter the clock's settings or modes, press and hold the ALM or ALARM MODE buttons. The display will indicate the successful selection of either AM or PM when adjusted. 

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
The clock features three operational modes, accessible exclusively through these buttons. If the ALM is activated, it can be managed through these settings. Adjustments are retained until confirmed by pressing the ALM button again as needed. 

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
To operate the FM/AM radio, use the POWER ON/OFF button located at the top. The initial step involves selecting FM or AM using the appropriate toggle buttons. Tuning in to a station can be done by either repeating the station selection or using the search function. The FM ST indicator will appear once a station is successfully tuned. Volume adjustments can be made prior to shutting off the device with the POWER ON/OFF button.

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
For storing radio stations, users can save up to 10 FM and 10 AM stations in memory. To save a station, press the MEMORY button while the station is playing. It is crucial to watch for a flashing indicator that signifies a successful memory operation. To recall stored stations, use the AM/FM button followed by the PRESET button to navigate through the presets. 

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
Important to note is that FM stations are stored as F1 through F10, while AM stations are A1 through A10. Memory operations take place within a few seconds, confirmed by a flashing indicator. 

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
The FM reception relies on a built-in AC cord, which should be properly connected for optimal signal quality. Similarly, ensure the AM reception is optimized by adjusting the position of the device as needed.

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
Regarding CD playback, the player is compatible with standard CDs (CD-R) and CD Rewritable disks (CD-RW). Note that playback performance can vary based on the software used to burn the CDs. To activate the player, press the POWER ON/OFF button. If it was previously turned off, the CD tray status will be indicated, prompting insertion of a disc with the label facing upwards. 

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
Pressing the PLAY/PAUSE button will display the current track information. If a CD is damaged or scratched, playback may be hindered. Adjust the volume to suit the playback quality. 

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
To open the CD tray, use the OPEN/CLOSE button, and remember to switch off the device with the POWER ON/OFF button when it is not in use. The TIME display will indicate the current track, which can be temporarily paused by pressing the PLAY/PAUSE button.

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
Utilizing the SNOOZE function allows users to briefly delay the alarm wake-up time. Activate this feature with the provided button, temporarily silencing the alarm while it is already active. 

**CKD5811_080306.p65**  
The SLEEP function permits the radio or CD to play for a predetermined time before automatically shutting off. Adjust the volume to desired levels, then select the SLEEP setting and determine the time duration. The countdown will initiate, and the system will turn off after the specified time elapses.

CKD5811_080306.p65 NAP Functionality (NAP Only) To activate or deactivate, press the NAP button located at the top. The NAP display will show up accordingly. You can adjust the duration of the NAP by using the designated buttons to increase or decrease the time from the set duration. To reset the SNOOZE DIMMER, it should be set to HI (High) by default. If the brightness is excessive, adjust the DIMMER switch to LO. Headphones (PHONES) should be connected on the right side; the unit will mute its built-in speakers when headphones are in use. Adjust the volume as needed when connecting headphones. It is often recommended to set the volume high for optimal listening. 

The Lithium Battery in the unit will eventually need replacement. Factors, such as usage patterns and frequency of AC power interruptions, influence the lifespan of the battery. Once installed, its supply lasts for several years if continuously connected to an AC source. If used within a few months of manufacturing, a fresh lithium battery should provide power for at least five years, even with occasional interruptions. For replacement, procure a 3V lithium battery (type CR2430) from a retailer. 

IMPORTANT: Ensure the device is connected to AC power when replacing the battery to preserve memory. Use a screwdriver to remove the screws carefully, being cautious not to misplace them.

CKD5811_080306.p65 Clock Memory: If the internal lithium battery runs low, a flashing warning will signal this. The clock may halt if disconnected from AC power or when the battery is depleted, and it will need a fresh lithium battery or connection to AC to restore functionality. If both the lithium battery and AC supply fail, the clock will stop entirely. 

To reset the clock memory, follow these steps using a CR2430 lithium battery: reconnect to an AC outlet and reset the MONTH/DATE and TIME settings simultaneously. Hold down the MONTH/DATE and TIME buttons, adjust the necessary settings, then release the buttons. 

While holding the MONTH/DATE button, navigate through the Month and Date settings. The month should display correctly once adjusted.

Verify that the AM/PM indicator displays accurately along with the Month/Date. If adjustments are necessary, repeat the process. The clock's memory relies on the lithium battery over the years and depends on proper care and maintenance.

CKD5811_080306.p65 Care and Maintenance: For cleaning, use a lint-free cloth to wipe the compact unit and avoid using harsh cleaners. Ensure that cleaning actions are straightforward and avoid direct application of cleaning products on the unit. 

Lithium Battery Precautions: Handle the battery appropriately. Keep it out of reach of children. If ingested or improperly handled, seek medical advice immediately. The battery should not be charged or subjected to fire.
