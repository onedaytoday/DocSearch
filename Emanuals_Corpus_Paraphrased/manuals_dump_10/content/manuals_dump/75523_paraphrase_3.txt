**CLEANING GUIDELINES FOR THE CERAMIC GLASS COOKTOP (CONTINUED)**

**CAUTION:** For foods with high sugar content, immediately turn off the cooktop to prevent damage. Allow the surface to cool down, then clean off any heavy residue. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or tools that can scratch the ceramic surface. Do not use bleach or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the surface or cleaning cloths.

**FOR COMMON ISSUES:** Ensure you preheat the oven appropriately for baking items like cookies, bread, and cakes. Incorrect preheating can lead to undesirable cooking results. Avoid overcrowding the oven or cooking at excessively high temperatures, as this may warp the cookware or reduce clearance, leading to uneven cooking. If temperatures exceed the recommended range (more than 25°F/12°C), recalibrate as necessary.

**IMPORTANT SERVICE NOTES:** This warranty covers parts and workmanship. If the oven control beeps or displays an error code, cancel and reset as needed. Should the oven malfunction or not operate when the power supply is interrupted, check connections and ensure the cord is secure. If the oven light is out, replace it according to the instructions.

**SELF-CLEANING CYCLE ISSUES:** Ensure the oven door is closed properly for the self-cleaning cycle to function. If the oven smokes excessively during broiling, check the position of the meat and preheat correctly to avoid curling or residual grease buildup. Grease should be cleaned regularly to avoid consistent smoking.

**UNRELEASED SOIL AFTER CLEANING:** If residue remains after a self-cleaning cycle, ensure the cycle was properly executed and follow the instructions for optimal cleaning.

**COOKING PERFORMANCE CONSISTENCIES:** Common issues leading to poor cooking results may include the use of lightweight cookware or warped surfaces, leading to uneven heat distribution. 

**SURFACE ELEMENT ISSUES:** If a surface element does not heat properly, check and reset any connections or switches. Adjust heat settings if necessary, and ensure you use weight-appropriate cookware to achieve even heating.

**SURFACE IMPERFECTIONS:** Brown streaks, specks, or metal marks may appear on the ceramic surface. Use recommended cleaners for removal as outlined in the cleaning section.
