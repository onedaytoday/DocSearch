Warnings may sound when certain selections are made. The software version and operational status are also displayed.

Current operating modes, such as Child, Meatprobe, and Steam cooking, should be monitored for countdown purposes.

To access specific functions, users must press the relevant buttons repeatedly until the desired function appears. For any selected cooking duration—whether in hours or seconds—users must confirm their choice. Acoustic signals may indicate the end of a cooking cycle, and functions can be switched off at any time.
