### SANTO Upright Operating Instructions

**Customer Operation Guidance**

Please refer to these operating instructions for important information. They are essential for the proper use and understanding of your appliance, especially notable warnings regarding functionality.

**Technical Terminology**

Definitions of technical terms can be found in the "Technical Terminology" section of the operating instructions. Users should consult these guidelines for troubleshooting malfunctioning appliances; if issues persist, contact AEG Service Force.

**Appliance Information**

### Appliance Location
Ensure the appliance is positioned in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Placement must comply with temperature ratings indicated on the appliance. The appliance dimensions may vary by model, which are detailed further in this document.

**Electrical Requirements**

WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED. Always ensure the electricity supply matches the ratings stated on the rating plate. The appliance must be connected using the correct color-coded wiring as follows: yellow/green to E (earth), blue to N (neutral), and brown to L (live). Ensure the cord is free from damage to prevent electrical hazards.

**Operational Indicators**

The appliance includes an ON/OFF indicator light and a FAST CHILL light (yellow) that indicates the cooling mode's activation. Each button (WARMER and COLDER) toggles the desired temperature setting. The actual temperature will display until changes are made. If a malfunction occurs, both indicators will signal the need for attention.

**Switching Off the Appliance**

To switch off, press the ON/OFF button until the indicator light goes out. Ensure thorough cleaning after use. If the appliance is closed during operation, allow adequate time for equalization between internal and external temperatures.

**Storage Recommendations**

Place food items in appropriate sections based on temperature requirements; items at or near the front may be warmer than those at the rear or on lower shelves. Monitor food placement, especially for items requiring consistent refrigeration.

**Food Safety Tips**

For optimal food preservation, maintain recommended temperatures—below 4°C for perishables. Use a thermometer to verify temperatures regularly, and ensure food stays covered to prevent spoilage.

For further information concerning food safety practices, consult local food safety authorities.

### Normal Sounds
You may notice typical sounds from your appliance, such as a whirring noise from the cooling system, or sounds related to the thermostat when it activates. Ensure food is properly covered and arranged to allow heat to circulate evenly, especially near cooling elements or dishwashers, to prevent obstruction. Also, verify that the door seals correctly to avoid excess heat escaping.

### Defrosting
Frost may accumulate in the appliance when defrosting. Thaw ice collected in the base by turning off the appliance and disconnecting it from the electrical supply before cleaning. Use approved cleaning products, avoiding bleach or abrasive substances, especially near electrical outlets. Ensure the exterior is kept clean to maintain cooling efficiency.

### Light
**Warning: Risk of Electric Shock!** Before performing any maintenance, turn off the light switch. Specifications for the replacement light include voltage and wattage ratings. For purchases or service, contact AEG Service Force.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter a problem—such as excessive frost build-up or operational issues—check that the appliance is not overloaded and that the door seals are intact. If there is any moisture or water leakage, disconnect the unit immediately and consult AEG Service Force for potential mechanical breakdowns.
