**Shelf Management:**

To maintain the shelf properly, ensure that both the front and rear areas are accessible. When placing items like bottles on the shelf, caution is necessary to prevent clutter. Regular maintenance enhances performance and extends lifespan. 

**Cleaning Guidelines:**

Use only approved cleaners for stainless steel. Avoid chemicals containing bleach, and do not clean with steel wool pads or non-stainless steel specific products (including general surface cleaners). If surface discoloration occurs, address it with Bon-Ami or a suitable cleanser and a soft cloth. High-quality all-in-one cleaners can be used, but abrasive pads like Scotch-Brite will damage the surface finish. Always disconnect power before cleaning.
