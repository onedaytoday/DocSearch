Here's a paraphrased version of the provided text:

To effectively use the convection settings in your oven, it's important to understand how heat is distributed. In the Convection/Broil mode, heat is primarily concentrated at the top, while in the Convection/Bake mode, heat rises from the bottom to the top. Combining convection with roasting significantly enhances cooking efficiency, particularly for larger cuts of meat or whole roasts, reducing cooking times considerably. To ensure meats are properly cooked without drying out, a meat thermometer is recommended to check the internal temperature at the thickest part, avoiding overcooking.

For poultry, it’s best to preheat the oven according to the Convection Poultry Roasting Chart, which suggests an internal temperature of 185°F (85°C) for fully cooked poultry. This ensures the meat separates easily from the bone. 

When preparing seafood using the Convection/Broil method, it is essential to use appropriate cooking times to ensure thorough cooking without overdoing it. Convection cooking promotes even heat distribution, enhancing the texture and flavor of dishes by facilitating moisture retention. 

For various baked goods, such as yeast breads and desserts, following preheating guidelines and accurate cooking times will yield the best results. Each chart provides specific oven temperatures and cooking times based on the food type and size. 

Cleaning your oven requires using non-abrasive methods to maintain its finish. Regular maintenance and servicing should be carried out by qualified personnel to ensure safety and functionality.
