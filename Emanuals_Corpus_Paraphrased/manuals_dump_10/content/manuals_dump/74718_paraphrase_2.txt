## Important Safety Instructions
These instructions are crucial for safe use. Before operating the appliance, customers are urged to read the guidelines carefully. Due to its weight, proper handling is vital when moving or installing the unit. The appliance must not be exposed to direct heat sources or positioned near boiling elements. Ensure that the back of the appliance has adequate clearance as per the manufacturer's instructions. Allow the appliance to stabilize for a specified period before initial use.

The unit may become unsafe if modifications are attempted or if it is not serviced by qualified personnel. Keep children away from the appliance to avoid potential hazards, including suffocation risks. Only authorized technicians should conduct repairs or servicing. Avoid placing the unit in direct sunlight or near heat sources, and refrain from using any flammable materials near the appliance.

When introducing food into the appliance, consider the capacity limits to prevent spoilage or burns caused by frost. Follow the specified procedures for food storage and use, including proper segregation of items to minimize frost buildup and ensure safety.

## Appliance Description
- Fresh Food Compartment
- Cold Food Compartment

## Operation Guidelines
To start the appliance, turn the thermostat (indicated by a yellow warning light). Initially set to -16°C. The yellow light indicates the unit is activated, while the red warning light alerts you if the internal temperature exceeds -12°C. For optimal fresh food preservation, maintain the temperature at -18°C. If the red light remains illuminated, check the thermostat settings and food placement.

Once food items are completely frozen (this may take several hours), manually switch off the fast-freeze function. Load items correctly to ensure even freezing and airflow, keeping the item limit in mind for maximum efficiency. Recommended initial storage involves appropriate preparation and placement techniques to enhance preservation.

## Food Storage Recommendations
Food should be well-prepared before freezing to prevent deterioration. For best results, consume thawed items quickly or re-cook them when refreezing is not advisable. Defrosting should be done at recommended temperatures to avoid health risks.

## Maintenance and Cleaning
Always disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply before cleaning. Avoid using harsh detergents, abrasive materials, or strong-smelling cleaning products inside the unit, as these can damage surfaces and create unwanted odors. A thorough cleaning schedule, ideally once a year, will maintain efficient operation.

## Troubleshooting 
In case of issues, ensure proper installation and check the thermostat settings. Continuous frost buildup or mechanical failures should be addressed by professional services. For further assistance, contact customer service with details of any observed malfunctions.
