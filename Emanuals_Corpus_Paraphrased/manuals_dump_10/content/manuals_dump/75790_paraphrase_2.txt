**GB Technical Overview**

The device continually operates under a thermostatic system. Proper use requires that products are stored correctly—neither too closely together nor too loosely. All items should be adequately wrapped to maintain temperature efficiency. 

To ensure optimal performance, it’s critical to regularly clean the thermostat and set it to higher temperatures, which promotes effective cooling. The thermostat should also be checked to ensure it is functioning correctly. High temperatures can degrade food quality, so it's important to monitor settings and maintain cleanliness.

**Installation and Setup**

In terms of installation, the unit must be positioned in alignment with designated height specifications (EU Rated A). Ensure the unit is unpacked and cleaned according to the provided guidelines immediately after purchase.

**Class Ratings and Defrosting Information**

The cooling performance may vary based on changing external temperatures. Should the defrost function kick in, it generally indicates the need for an adjustment in the cooling settings. Additionally, angled spacers and screws must be appropriately secured to facilitate optimal function and avoid obstruction.

**Electrical Specifications**

The unit must be earthed and connected to a power supply that meets specified ratings. The wiring should comply with color-coded standards: brown for live (L), blue for neutral (N), and green/yellow for earth (E). If repairs are needed, contact service technicians to avoid safety risks.

**Food Storage Guidelines**

For optimal freshness, store various food items in airtight packaging:
- Meats, including roasted and minced varieties, have specific storage durations depending on type and preparation.
- Ready-cooked meals and soups should be utilized within set months.
- Ensure food temperatures are maintained within the recommended range, and consult the accompanying chart for safe storage practices.
