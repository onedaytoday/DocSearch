### Appliance Operating Modes

The appliance offers various operating modes, each designed for specific functions:

- **SHOPPING Mode**: This mode operates for a specified duration (C hours) to cool the section.
- **FROSTMATIC Mode**: This mode also works for a specified duration (C hours) to cool the section.
- **COOLMATIC Mode**: Operates for C hours to maintain optimal cooling.
- **HOLIDAY Mode**: Designed for C hours, suitable for extended periods of inactivity.
- **FROSTMATIC and COOLMATIC Mode**: Combines the functionalities for C hours.

To initiate normal operation, press the MODE button once. The SHOPPING indicator will flash for a few seconds. If you wish to switch modes, press the MODE button repeatedly to cycle through options, such as SHOPPING, FROSTMATIC, COOLMATIC, or HOLIDAY.

Warnings will appear if the door is left open for too long or if the temperature rises significantly, accompanied by a POWER SERVICE indicator.

Upon initial setup, it's important to allow the appliance to stabilize for a specific duration. Please ensure proper installation as per the instructions and allow sufficient time for cooling.

#### Operation and Settings

The system includes an ON/OFF switch and an adjustable temperature setting where pressing WARMER or COLDER will toggle the desired temperature. Each setting will display the selected temperature until adjustments stabilize.

To switch off individual modes, repeatedly press the MODE button until the desired mode is deactivated. For instance, the SHOPPING mode helps cool the section more rapidly when loaded with fresh food, while FROSTMATIC protects pre-frozen items.

#### Holiday and Off Modes

The HOLIDAY mode is specifically for when the appliance will not be in use for an extended period, minimizing energy usage while preventing spoilage. To activate this mode, repeatedly press the MODE button until it is selected; a light will indicate it's been engaged.

To turn the appliance off entirely, hold the ON/OFF button until a countdown displays, indicating the shutdown process. If interrupted during this process, reconnecting the supply will leverage safety features, including alarm signals for any anomalies.

#### Alerts and Troubleshooting

Warnings regarding door status or high temperatures will trigger alerts. The Appliance will indicate service requirements if malfunctions are detected. If the internal temperature falls below recommended levels, the system will switch off.

For any operational irregularities, consult Customer Service and report any persistent issues or malfunction warnings. Regular cleaning and maintenance are crucial for optimal performance, including regular defrosting where necessary.

The LONGFRESH C shelving system is designed to optimize storage conditions for food by maintaining low temperatures and ensuring freshness. It effectively preserves food quality compared to traditional fresh food storage while minimizing spoilage. The system includes features to facilitate rapid defrosting of food items, enabling the removal of defrosted products for further use.

The accessories included with the LONGFRESH C are adjustable to accommodate different heights, enhancing organization and accessibility. Specifically, the Dry food section benefits from optimal airflow and cooling performance, supporting the quick chilling of bottles and cans. The COOLMATIC function offers rapid cooling for newly added items, and it is automated to switch off once the desired temperature is reached.

To ensure the longevity and quality of stored food items, it is essential to monitor temperature consistently, ideally using a thermometer. Foods like shellfish and meat should be stored properly in the designated sections to prevent spoilage. Items should be well-wrapped and separated to avoid cross-contamination and maintain freshness.

For optimal defrosting, it is important to clear frost buildup in designated compartments, and any defrosting should adhere to safe operating guidelines to avoid health hazards from improper handling. Regular cleaning is necessary to sustain performance; disconnect the appliance from power during this process. 

Normal operational sounds, such as whirring and airflow, are typical and should not cause concern unless accompanied by warning signals like flashing lights or temperature alarms. Should any issues arise, consulting the service manual or contacting support is recommended to ensure prompt resolution. Adjusting storage methods, maintaining cleanliness, and regularly monitoring functionality will enhance the performance and reliability of the LONGFRESH C system.

This text adheres to the EU directives 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG (including 92/31/EWG) regarding EMV technical terminology related to cooling systems. These systems are specifically designed to manage heat generated from food products. The heat removal processes are built-in and located at the rear of the units to ensure efficient cooling.
