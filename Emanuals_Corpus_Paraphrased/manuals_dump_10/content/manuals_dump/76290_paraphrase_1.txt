To clean the unit, use appropriate cleaning products and cloths on the dishes. For areas that are difficult to reach, such as corners or recesses, utilize a toothbrush for effective cleaning. Inspect the components regularly and act accordingly.

If the system requires cooling before maintenance, ensure it is completely powered down. Release and empty the contents through the designated back hose and its attachment point. Disconnect the water supply and unscrew the hose from its connector. After cleaning, reattach the hose securely.

If temperatures fall below 0Â°C, follow the specified procedures for dealing with the emptying hose to prevent freezing and potential damage. Continuously monitor the emptying hose to ensure proper functionality.

In case of a blockage or malfunction, verify that the hose is adequately sealed and that the system is operating correctly. If user intervention is required, refer to the user manual for guidance on troubleshooting and maintenance.
