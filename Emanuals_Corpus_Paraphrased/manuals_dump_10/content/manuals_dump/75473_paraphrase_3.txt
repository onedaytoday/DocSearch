### Cleaning Instructions for Cookware

When cleaning your cookware, avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch the surface. Always use a soft cloth for cleaning. For thorough cleaning, first, utilize a suitable cleaner like Stahl-Fix, then follow up with a cloth for a spotless finish. 

If you encounter stubborn food residues, start with a cloth, then apply the recommended cleaners. Immediate action is advised for burnt food to prevent damage. Do not use polishing agents on cookware that is stained or discolored.

When cleaning, ensure that you only use approved products to avoid scratching the surface. If the appearance of the cookware changes due to improper cleaning, consult AEG Service Force for assistance, as this could indicate a need for repairs.

### Operating Instructions

For safe operation, follow the provided instructions. If there’s any malfunction, do not attempt repairs on your own—contact AEG Service Force for professional service. Ensure the cookware is intact and properly connected before use. Check that it is switched on and that all heating sections are functioning as intended.

If the heat display is activated, make sure to power it off safely. To confirm activation, you should hear a tone after pressing the selection buttons. Any overheating will be displayed; if this occurs, determine if it’s due to incorrect installation.
