**Safety Guidelines for Microwave Use**

To minimize fire risks, ensure proper microwave operation to prevent overheating of foods. Always monitor the heating process; if food begins to overheat or ignite, do not open the door. Instead, turn off the microwave and let the situation settle.

Popcorn and similar items should follow specific instructions to prevent potential issues.

**Food Preparation Considerations**

Different food types require varying cooking times; lighter items cook faster than denser foods. Ensure uniform cooking by rearranging items as needed during the process. For best results, avoid overcrowding the turntable.

**Thermometer Guidance for Proper Cooking**

After cooking, use a food thermometer to verify internal temperatures. Adhere to recommended cooking temperatures for various food types to ensure safety and quality.
