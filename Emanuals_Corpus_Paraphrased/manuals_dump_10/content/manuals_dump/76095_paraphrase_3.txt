Thank you for choosing our rechargeable household cleaner. This device is designed for dry cleaning and provides efficient performance.

**Features and Accessories:**
- The unit has an on/off switch and a charging indicator. It is crucial to ensure that children are supervised while using the cleaner, as it operates at a specific power rating indicated on the charger. Avoid exposing the charger or the cleaner to extreme temperatures or direct sunlight, and do not dismantle or short-circuit the unit, as this may void the warranty.

**Charging Station:**
- The charging station must be turned off when not in use. The cleaner requires approximately several hours for an initial full charge to achieve optimal performance. It is equipped with a hollow space for neatly storing the charging cable. 

**Emptying and Cleaning:**
- When the indicator shows that the waste compartment is full, empty the contents promptly. To do this, release the compartment and dispose of the waste properly. Regular cleaning is recommended to maintain high suction power. After thorough cleaning, reassemble the parts carefully, ensuring all components are secured.
