**Earth Continuity and Insulation Checks**

**A: Earth Continuity**
- Perform tests: NO, YES, NO, YES—address any faults.
- Rectify as necessary.

**B: Insulation**
- Conduct an insulation check, rectifying as needed.

**Ignitor Components**
- A: Ignitor Switch
- B: Ignitor Unit Socket Plug (with cover—Earth Green/Yellow)

**C: Polarity**
- A. **Earth Continuity Check:** Ensure the appliance is electrically disconnected. Verify continuity from earth to earth; connections should be clean and secure.
- B. **Insulation Check:** Ensure the appliance is electrically disconnected, with switches turned ON. If the resistance reads zero, there’s an issue.

**E: Insulation Readings**
- If readings indicate less than infinity, there is a problem.

**Important Note:**
- Inspect for signs of burning or arcing, particularly around the fuse supply, to ensure it is functioning properly.

**D: Earth**
- Confirm necessary polarity and earth continuity from 'N' to 'O' and from 'L' through the switches to each terminal.
- Test insulation of the high-tension (HT) leads as well.
