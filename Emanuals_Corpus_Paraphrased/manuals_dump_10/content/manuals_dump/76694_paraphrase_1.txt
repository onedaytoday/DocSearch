For installation guidance, please refer to the information provided below. To proceed with your setup, ensure you have the following items: Top Tension Assembly, Top Elbow, Wall Screws, and Plates (use Black Cloth only for AcousticPro). 

Connect the components using the provided screws. Ensure correct assembly of both the Elbow and the Tension plates. Align the screws in the designated corners, as shown, using the included fasteners to secure everything properly.

To maximize performance, apply the Tension through the specified slots on the back of the plates. The AcousticPro1080 features a black cloth that reduces light reflection, enhancing the viewing experience. When installing the Black plates, position them against the white surface of the AcousticPro1080, ensuring they create the needed friction and tension for optimal performance.

Clean the plates as needed, ensuring they maintain their stretch and fit. Follow these instructions carefully to attach the plates securely without excessive stretching, ensuring they are placed at the top rear of the frame.

When installing, make sure to avoid obstructions like switches and outlets. Use the included screws to securely mount the Frame to the wall, ensuring the structure is stable. The installation allows flexibility for proper centering.

For cleaning, use a high-quality cloth, avoiding direct contact with chemicals or cleaners that may damage the surface. Keep the screen out of reach from household items that may affect its functionality.
