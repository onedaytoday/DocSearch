### RANGE COMPOSITION

The equipment features components that enhance performance and efficiency. Constructed from AISI-grade stainless steel, the units include functional and structural elements designed for high adaptability. The adjustable top and back provide ease of maintenance and facilitate internal cleaning. The rounded corners enhance hygiene by enabling thorough cleaning.

The devices incorporate forced cooling at +43Â°C to ensure even temperature distribution. They employ high-density expanded polyurethane insulation, injected with cyclopentane, for long-lasting thermal retention. The interior design is optimized for GN standards with self-closing doors that simplify operation. Recessed handles improve accessibility while the integrated microswitch automatically powers off the unit when the door is ajar. The materials used are CFC and HCFC free, aligning with international regulations.
