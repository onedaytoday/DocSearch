#### Warning  
Forcing disconnections or improper handling may lead to memory issues or data loss. Always ensure safe removal practices are followed.

Please follow these technical guidelines for connecting your device to a PC using USB and UVC software. Ensure that the UVC software is properly installed on the PC, as it will facilitate the operation of the USB connection. 

When connecting to the PC, if the software fails to refresh, check the USB to Application settings. Be cautious while using the USB interface; any interruptions during operation may cause malfunction. If the UVC application displays messages, ensure the USB connection is stable, and restart your device if necessary.

For wireless functionality, such as with the ELMO Wireless (CRA-1), you can directly perform operations such as in/out adjustments. It’s essential to maintain proper orientation while operating the touch function on the interactive whiteboard (IWB). Lightly touch the screen at the designated areas for accurate responsiveness.

Review specific functions related to the IWB, including the ability to show/hide on-screen data and adjust settings like brightness and thickness of markings. Ensure that the background settings align with user preferences for optimal display.

Maintain a steady connection when using thumbnails to navigate options, and remember to protect or unlock the selected files as needed. Pay close attention to the operation status indicators; if any issues arise, refer back to the guidelines or restart as necessary.
