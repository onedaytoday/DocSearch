**General Advice**

For glass cooktops, avoid using abrasive cleaners or materials that could scratch the surface. Additionally, ensure that vents are unobstructed while operating the oven. 

**Controls and Features**

Refer to your model's specific controls for effective cooking. Use the temperature recommendations to cook various food types appropriately, adjusting settings based on cookware type and food requirements.

Please be cautious of heat distribution and avoid contact with hot surfaces to prevent burns. Familiarize yourself with your cooktop features for optimal performance. 

Keep these instructions for future reference and consult them when needed to ensure safe and effective operation.

**Continued Instructions for the ESEC Cooktop:**

The ESEC cooktop features indicator lights that signify when the surface is hot. The HOT light will illuminate while the cooktop is active and will turn off once it has adequately cooled down. If the ESEC is in self-cleaning mode, follow the provided safety protocols. Ensure the correct cookware is used to facilitate optimal cooking performance. 

For efficient heat distribution during cooking, it's critical to recognize the heating characteristics of various cookware materials. Aluminum heats quickly but can scratch easily, while copper provides good conductivity. Stainless steel offers easy cooking without burning, and cast iron retains heat well. Porcelain-enamel and glass cookware are not recommended, as they can scratch the cooktop's surface.

The ESEC's vent system is designed to release steam and cooking odors. Always arrange oven racks when the unit is cool before using. The recommended rack positions for various cooking methods (broiling, baking, roasting) ensure optimal results.

**Warmer Function:**

The warmer is designed to maintain the temperature of food items. Ensure the warmer is preheated before placing food inside, and cover food to retain its quality. Handle with care to avoid burns, using potholders if necessary. 

Select the appropriate setting (HI, MED, LO) to maintain food temperature, ensuring that the warmer indicator light is illuminated. The warmer light will flash during operation until fully preheated. Follow safety precautions and avoid overcrowding within the warmer to ensure even heating.

**Broiling:**

When broiling meats, monitor closely to prevent overcooking. Keep the area clear of grease to reduce fire hazards. Should a fire occur, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; rather, use an appropriate fire extinguisher.

**Cleaning Guidelines:**

Cleaning should be performed regularly to prevent buildup and minimize heavy soiling. Remove spills promptly and use appropriate cleaners for different surfaces, avoiding abrasive materials that can damage finishes. Itâ€™s crucial to allow the cooktop to cool down completely before cleaning. 

Never immerse the heating elements in water; instead, follow specific cleaning protocols for different materials and surfaces. For stubborn stains or burnt food, gentle scrubbing with non-abrasive cleaners may be necessary. Always ensure safety and maintain the appliance's condition by adhering to all recommended cleaning practices.
