### COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Functions

**COOLMATIC**: The COOLMATIC function activates cooling for enhanced preservation of food products. Once selected, it maintains the chosen temperature for a specified duration. After this period, the system automatically reverts to the previously set temperature.

**FROSTMATIC**: The FROSTMATIC function ensures rapid freezing of fresh food items while also safeguarding previously stored items. This function can be manually activated and deactivated, indicated by a corresponding light. If switched off manually, the FROSTMATIC light will extinguish.

### Appliance Operation

To turn off the appliance, press the ON/OFF button. A countdown timer will be displayed, and once it reaches zero, the appliance will shut down, signified by the light going out. For a complete power disconnection, ensure the appliance is unplugged. If a power interruption occurs, the appliance will resume normal operation once power is restored. To turn it off quickly, hold the ON/OFF button or unplug.

**Defrosting and Cleaning**: Regular defrosting and cleaning are essential for optimal operation. The interior should be maintained at the proper temperature to prevent issues like mold growth during prolonged closures. To adjust the temperature, use the (WARMER) or (COLDER) buttons until the desired setting is reached.

### Alerts and Information

The appliance features an acoustic alert system to notify users of various conditions, such as temperature deviations that may affect food quality. For instance, an alarm will sound if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold for an extended period. Users can disable the alarm by pressing the ALARM OFF button.

### Proper Food Storage

To maximize freshness, store food items appropriately according to their required temperatures. Place meat and similar products on the lower shelves where it is coldest. Use a thermometer to verify temperatures and ensure they remain below specified limits.

**Important Storage Tips**:
- Cover food to prevent cross-contamination.
- Avoid overpacking to ensure proper airflow.
- Use airtight containers for sensitive items.

### Ice Cube Preparation

Ice cube trays should be filled efficiently, allowing time for freezing. Pay attention during defrosting; newly thawed food should not refreeze without proper handling. Avoid using mechanical means that could damage the appliance.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Perform regular maintenance to ensure peak performance:
- Unplug the appliance before cleaning or defrosting.
- Use non-abrasive cleaners suitable for food appliances.
