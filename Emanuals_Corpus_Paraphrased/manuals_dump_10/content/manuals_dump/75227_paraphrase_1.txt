### Defrosting Function
To defrost food, remove it from packaging and place it on a shelf. Cover the food, as this significantly enhances the defrosting process for items like meat and fish. For example, if defrosting a trout or whipped cream, additional time may be required.

### Drying Function
Utilize convection on heated shelves that are lined with greaseproof paper. Switch off the function and allow the food to cool overnight, which is essential for items like beans, mushrooms, apricots, apples, and pears, requiring several hours for proper drying.

### Cleaning and Warnings
Ensure the appliance is turned off and cooled before cleaning. Caution: High-pressure cleaners should not be used for safety reasons. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scrapers, as they can scratch the surfaces, potentially leading to cracks or shattering. For cleaning the front and interior, use a soft cloth and avoid scouring pads. The self-cleaning feature should be utilized with the appliance empty and preheated without food. After a self-cleaning cycle, everything should be cooled down before cleaning again with appropriate detergents.
