Here’s a paraphrased version of the text with a similar meaning:

When laundering items such as white clothing, towels, or tablecloths, it's crucial to separate whites from colors. New colored items should always be washed initially with whites to prevent color transfer, and treatment options should be followed as indicated in care charts. Avoid overloading the washing machine to ensure thorough cleaning.

For stubborn stains found on items like bathrobes and towels, pre-treatment with a suitable stain remover may be necessary. Use cold water for washing whites, and consider bleach for whites and colors when recommended. For specific stains, such as lipstick, treat the fabric as advised.

Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for washing temperatures, which typically should be around 60°C. Ensure to disconnect the appliance from the power supply before maintenance or cleaning tasks.

Regular cleaning of washing machine components, such as the hose and filters, is essential. If needing to empty water, ensure the appliance is off and follow the instructions carefully to prevent damage.

Ensure that hoses are correctly assembled and free from blockages. Always turn off the water supply when not in use. If experiencing issues, consult service guidelines or contact customer support for assistance. The appliance should be installed following local regulations, and any replacements should adhere to safety standards.

For optimal performance, refer to care instructions and follow guidelines for loading and washing items appropriately. When in doubt, consult the included technical documentation or the manufacturer's website for guidance.
