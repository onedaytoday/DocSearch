**AM Black KO-LAVAMAT LAVAMAT TURBO ELECTRONIC Washer-Dryer Instructions**

Dear Customer,

We recommend thoroughly reading these operating instructions prior to using your washer-dryer, as they contain important information for both new and existing users. Please pay attention to all warnings and guidelines, which are essential for the safe and effective usage of the machine. If you experience any issues, feel free to contact AEG Appliances at High Street, Slough SL1 1DZ.

**Safety Features and Controls**

The washer-dryer features various options including START/PAUSE, DELAY START, electronic drying, DRYING TIME, STAIN, QUICK SOAK, PREWASH, SPIN SPEED, and RINSE HOLD. Prior to starting, it is crucial to sort laundry by type and decide on the appropriate additives.

**Drying and Washing Options**

Choose the drying duration based on load requirements, and select from available washing options like SPIN SPEED, RINSE HOLD, and EXTRA RINSE. Use the DELAY START feature to schedule washing. Follow manuals for emergency draining and troubleshooting unsatisfactory washing outcomes.

**Installation and Maintenance**

Ensure proper unpacking and positioning, and be cautious when dealing with water supply and drainage. Due to potential hazards, repairs should only be conducted by a qualified technician to avoid serious malfunctions.

**Child Safety**

Children should not operate the washer-dryer. Ensure safe usage by keeping controls out of reach. If any issues arise with the machine’s operation that may impact safety, please refer to the guidelines provided.

**Recommended Usage**

For optimal results, separate laundry by fabric type. Generally, garments do not require pre-treatment and can be washed directly. Always follow the care labels and product instructions, especially regarding temperature settings and washing cycles.

**Cycle Information Display**

The control panel shows the duration of cycles, updating regularly as they progress. Lights indicate the different washing phases, including the completion of each cycle. Familiarize yourself with the START/PAUSE feature for managing ongoing cycles effectively.

**Using Additives**

Use the prewash compartment for detergents or stain removers, adhering to the recommended amounts. Always use appropriate cleaning products to maintain the condition of your clothes.

**Sorting Laundry**

Sort items by fabric type, such as heavy-duty blankets, delicate apparel, and towels. Wash whites separately to prevent color transfer, and ensure a balanced load for effective washing.

For detailed guidance on settings, types of fabrics, and recommended temperatures, refer to the instruction manual.

AM Black refers to a brand encompassing various laundry aids. Users can utilize either traditional powders directly on clothes or opt for liquids as measured according to specific instructions. For compact powders and liquids, these should be positioned on the top and back of the washer. Fabric conditioners are also available, which ease the care cycle for different textiles.

Warnings must be heeded regarding synthetic items, as improper handling can lead to damage or even fire hazards. 

For drying, various settings are available, and it’s essential to select the appropriate cycle based on fabric type as indicated in the provided chart. For normal drying processes, the duration varies based on the material's requirements. Before initiating the cycle, users can press the START/PAUSE to initiate the process or pause it as necessary. 

Additionally, for items needing special treatment, options like SOAK or STAIN-Action can be used without compromising the MAX setting. 

The machine allows for multiple selections, including EXTRA RINSE and DELAYED START, providing flexibility for users. Each button indicates its respective function through an array of lights. 

In case of overdosage, indicated by an alert light, users must adjust the quantity of detergent and adhere to the guidelines. Should the RINSE HOLD feature be activated, users can manually control the spin speed and drain function as needed.

During operation, acoustic signals affirm the completion of cycles. If any issues arise, such as during washing or drying, the selected options can be reviewed by pressing relevant buttons.

For effective cleaning, it’s advised to empty the washer exclusively when needed and to maintain cleanliness in fittings, hoses, and filters regularly to prevent blockages.

Should unforeseen issues persist (e.g., unusual noises), users are encouraged to consult troubleshooting guidelines. Error codes displayed will help identify specific problems for more efficient resolution.
