This document provides users with technical and installation information for the AEG-ELECTROLUX EFC60001X. It includes details about specifications and instructions for setting up the unit. 

To install, align screws X1 and X2 with washer C, then secure them through the outer brackets J1 and J2 as shown in the diagram. The unit can be configured for ducted or recirculating operation, depending on your setup preferences. If opting for recirculation, attach the supplied charcoal filter; regular replacement of this filter and cleaning of the housing is recommended to prevent fire hazards from grease buildup.

Ensure that the installation adheres to the specified electrical rating and that the unit is permanently connected to a secure power supply. 

For the chimney assembly, adjust the height using screws X1 and X2, applying force at the rear to facilitate proper positioning. For operation, toggle the slider switches located at the front to activate lighting and select speed settings. Speed 3 is recommended for high-heat cooking, while lower settings can be used for lighter tasks. 

Maintenance requires the grease filter to be cleaned every few months and can be done using a dishwasher or manually with a household cleaner. The charcoal filter should also be replaced regularly. 

For further information, please refer to the provided instructions and guidelines.
