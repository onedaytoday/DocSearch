# Electric Range Use and Care Guide

**October**

### Important Safety Instructions

When using your electric range, adhere to the following safety guidelines to prevent serious injury or property damage:

1. **Installation and Grounding**: Ensure the range is installed by a qualified technician and properly grounded according to national safety standards (ANSI/NFPA Standard or CSA C22.1). Follow all manufacturer instructions to avoid electrical shocks or fire hazards.

2. **Child Safety**: Keep children away from the range to prevent burns or injuries. Do not allow them to play near the cooking area, especially during operation.

3. **Heating Precautions**: Use caution with hot surfaces. Items like cookbooks or cloths should be kept away to avoid fires. If a fire occurs, smother it with a lid or use a foam extinguisher. Cooking utensils should be used appropriately to minimize burns.

4. **Food Safety**: Follow proper cooking instructions to ensure food is heated safely. Ensure cookware is compatible with the range and does not warp or scratch.

5. **Cleaning**: Regularly clean the cooktop to prevent grease buildup, which can catch fire. Use recommended cleaning agents and avoid harsh chemicals.

6. **Self-Cleaning Feature**: Utilize the self-cleaning function as per the manual. Ensure that the range is cool before starting this feature to avoid injury.

7. **Canning**: Use a straight-edge tool to secure canning jars in place. Start with high heat and then adjust down to maintain temperature. Follow guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for safe canning practices.

8. **Cookware Compatibility**: Use cookware that is well-balanced, heavy enough to conduct heat properly, and not warped. Ensure bottoms are smooth for effective heating.

9. **Emergency Preparedness**: Familiarize yourself with the location of a suitable fire extinguisher should a grease fire occur.

For further details and guidelines, please refer to the manufacturer's website or your product manual.

The four cooking zones feature displays for heat adjustment and operation statuses. Additional heating options are available to accommodate various types of cookware. Users can turn heating elements on and off, allowing for precise temperature control, while safety measures ensure that surfaces stay cool when not in use. Information regarding the operation can be found in the manual, including specific guidelines for Sabbath usage.

Food preparation is influenced by the type of cookware and the nature of the ingredients. Caution is advised, as improperly handled items can lead to burns or fires. High heat is designated for dense foods to promote proper cooking, while medium and low settings are recommended for lighter items. The "Warm" function is suitable for maintaining the temperature of pre-cooked dishes. 

When using any cooking aids, such as pot holders, operate with care as they can catch fire if left near heating elements. Position cookware with sufficient spacing around it to allow even heat distribution. 

For maintenance, follow the cleaning instructions provided in the manual to preserve the finish. To access components, use the designated release mechanism located on the front of the unit.

The convection settings allow for versatile cooking temperatures, ranging from 170°F (76°C) to 550°F (288°C). After a power interruption, the clock must be reset. The factory defaults may be adjusted between a 12-hour and a 24-hour format via the control panel.

Pressing specific buttons will adjust settings, including cooking time and temperature, and users are cautioned to avoid forcing any locked mechanisms. 

To preheat, select the desired temperature, and pressing "START" will activate the preheating process. A tone will indicate when the unit reaches the target temperature, at which point cooking may commence. 

Be aware of potential hazards; surfaces inside the unit can become extremely hot, leading to burns if disturbed during operation. If cooking extends beyond recommended times, the system is designed to alert users as a safety precaution. Always consult the manual for detailed operational guidance.

To preheat items such as cookies and breads, utilize the racks and cookware as indicated, ensuring at least a few inches of clearance between the cookware and the heating elements to prevent overheating or excessive browning of foods. It is advised to follow these guidelines for dough-based items like cakes and breads as they rely on specific cooking functions.

For cooking at a temperature of 350°F (176°C), activate the convection function by pressing the appropriate buttons, and then press START. When the cooking cycle initiates, the display will show "TIMED" and "BAKE," followed by an automatic shut-off after the cooking time elapses. To stop cooking at any time, the CANCEL button may be used. Be cautious about food safety; cooking items for more than an hour without supervision may pose a health risk.

To set the temperature to 375°F (191°C), follow the same pressing sequence to activate the convection cooking mode. Monitor the cooking process by listening for the tone indicating that the preheating phase is complete. Adjust cooking times based on the thickness and type of meat or poultry being prepared. 

For items requiring higher temperatures, such as 550°F (288°C), ensure that you follow the appropriate guidelines for cooking times, especially for thicker cuts of meat. In all cases, close attention should be paid to the specific instructions for cooking temperatures and techniques to optimize performance.

When roasting, keep the meat uncovered for accurate cooking, as covering can trap steam and affect browning. Ensure proper seating of cookware to avoid any hazards and note that cooking times can vary significantly based on the specific items being prepared.

For items that are being kept warm, use the KEEP WARM function and monitor the cooking progress to prevent overcooking. Adjust the heat settings as necessary and cover foods appropriately to promote even cooking.

It's essential to check instructions for your specific model, including any offset temperature adjustments needed for accurate cooking results. All guidelines should be carefully followed to guarantee optimal performance and food safety.

This document covers the operation details regarding cooking functions, including the Sabbath/Holidays mode, and maintenance instructions.

When utilizing the BAKE and heating features, the COOK TIME option should be set with the relevant displays visible. The default maximum cooking time is 12 hours. Ensure lights indicate when active. If any lights are on: once they are activated, the corresponding lights will turn off on completion.

For operations involving cooking, pressing the START button is crucial, and the clock settings can be adjusted as necessary. Functions like TIMED CHICKEN NUGGETS, CONVECT BAKE, PIZZA, DELAY TIMER, and others are included. Be cautious concerning food safety; food should not be left at room temperature for over an hour to prevent spoilage.

Restoring the appliance to factory settings involves modifying the clock settings to either 12-hour or 24-hour formats. Upon pressing START, the corresponding indicator lights will illuminate according to the status of the appliance. 

For self-cleaning, ensure to remove all items from the oven's interior and follow safety guidelines as the oven reaches high temperatures. Cleaning should include wiping surfaces post self-cleaning, avoiding abrasive materials that could scratch.

For painted finishes, use non-abrasive cleaners and cloths to maintain a scratch-free exterior. Avoid harsh chemicals, as they may damage surfaces.

Removing components requires complete cooling of the appliance. In the case of repairs or adjustments, follow specific guidelines carefully to prevent any hazards. Always prioritize safety instructions throughout.
