**IQ-Touch™ with Touch User Interface**

The IQ-Touch™ system features a Touch user interface that responds to physical interaction. It includes three Water Cubes that can be crushed and activated by the Touch controls. The options for activating and adjusting the food light are indicated below. To activate the food light, press and hold for three seconds; this limits operation hours and helps conserve energy. The function can also be manually activated by repeating the long press sequence. Additionally, sound tones can be customized to be turned off based on user preference, and sound notifications will be muted when a warning is active. The factory settings for sounds and notifications can be restored through a specific sequence of presses that includes a three-second hold to turn off cooling.

**CAUTION**: To utilize the shelves properly, you can easily adjust them to accommodate fresh food. Each shelf has a secure mounting system that entails tightening the spacers clockwise for stability. Shelf spacers facilitate easy removal and cleaning of food items. When humidity levels are high, some items like fresh meat should be stored accordingly to avoid spoilage.

The design permits storage for four bottles, ensuring that items can be arranged conveniently. It’s essential to manage item placement so that air circulation is not obstructed, enhancing overall efficiency. 

**Water Supply**: The system includes an advanced water supply capable of complete integration. To prevent malfunction, perform operational checks as needed, including flushing the initial water supply. It is recommended to turn the supply on/off regularly to control flow.

**IMPORTANT**: Always ensure the water supply is correctly connected and functioning to avoid issues during operation. Cleaning should involve turning off the switch and using appropriate cleaners to maintain efficacy. 

**Food Management**: Store fresh food properly without overcrowding the shelves to ensure optimal cooling. Items such as meats should be securely wrapped to prevent cross-contamination or spoilage. Organize foods to allow for proper airflow, which aids freezing efficiency. Take care to place food correctly to minimize build-up that can impede energy efficiency.

**Normal Operating Sounds**: Under standard operation, you will hear certain sounds that indicate the system is functioning correctly. These include the hissing of the defrost heater and various operational clicks, which signify that air is being efficiently circulated. If you hear unusual sounds, investigate potential issues with airflow or mechanical function.

This overall structure should assist in the effective operation and maintenance of the IQ-Touch™ system, ensuring a seamless experience for the user while preserving the integrity of stored items.
