This guide details the handling of washed items, outlining emptying procedures and available options. It provides instructions for using the Refresh function for items that are lightly soiled or for synthetics and delicates. It also discusses settings like ECO for whites and colors, emphasizing that white items should be laundered separately for optimal brightness. 

Sorting of laundry is essential — separate items by their categories, including whites, colors, synthetics, and towels. Dark colors should be washed in cold or lukewarm water. Stains should be treated prior to washing, and bleach can be used according to guidelines for whites and colors.

The choice of washing type is critical, including the temperature settings (preferably at 60°C) and whether prewash or additives are employed. The maximum capacity should be considered, as overloading can impair performance.

For maintenance and safety, ensure you disconnect the appliance before performing any cleaning or maintenance. Regularly check the cleaning systems and follow the safety warnings, including properly securing hoses to prevent leaks.

If service is required, troubleshooting information regarding error codes (e.g., E10, E20, E40) is included. Accurate positioning and securing of the water supply hose is crucial to avoid breakdowns. If issues persist, contact customer service for assistance.

Maintain the cleanliness of the hoses and the interior of the appliance, avoiding blockages that might arise from improper usage or maintenance. For optimized performance, ensure that all water supply connections are intact and procedures are correctly followed.
