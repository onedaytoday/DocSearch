- Perfect-Convection
- Preheat functions
- Temperature adjustments ranging from 100°F to 550°F 

**Timer and Control Features**

Use the timer to monitor cooking times. To set the timer, press the TIMER button as needed throughout the cooking process. The Wave-Touch interface will indicate active functions and assist in managing cooking durations.

**Cooking Equipment**

When using racks, ensure they are positioned correctly for optimal heating. Employ potholders to handle hot items and verify that all cookware is suitable for the cooktop.

For self-cleaning features, follow specific instructions to operate safely and effectively. The appliance should be maintained in a clean and grease-free condition.

**Lighting Options**

The appliance includes luxury lighting that activates during cooking and preheating phases, enhancing visibility and monitoring of food preparation.

For any installation and care queries, consult the specific sections in the manual for detailed guidance. 

**Cookware Guidelines**

The type and condition of cookware significantly impact cooking performance, especially regarding heat distribution. It is essential to use cookware that is flat and even to ensure optimal heat transfer. Cookware that is warped or has a diameter greater than one-half inch from the heating element may not heat food efficiently, leading to poor results. Any cookware with scratches should be addressed promptly, as these can affect heat retention and distribution.

When using the cooktop, ensure that all cookware is compatible with the heating system to prevent damage or poor cooking results. Proper alignment of the cookware is necessary for even heating; the cookware should not block any vents, and it should be placed securely over burners to avoid spills or burns.

**Heating Features**

The Wave-Touch controls feature LED displays that indicate the status of each burner. Users can adjust the heat levels (e.g., “HI” for maximum heat) using the appropriate buttons. If overheating occurs, the LED will flash as a warning. It is advisable to avoid using cookware that can catch fire easily, and to handle hot items with care using appropriate pot holders.

**Warmer Functionality**

The warmer feature is intended for keeping pre-cooked foods, such as stews and breads, at safe temperatures. However, it is not recommended to heat foods directly in the warmer or cover them tightly, as this could lead to burns. Always refer to the recommended food types for the warmer’s settings, avoiding foods outside the suggested temperature ranges.

**Preheating Options**

The preheat function is essential for achieving the desired cooking temperature before placing food in the oven. Specific temperatures (e.g., 350°F or 550°F) should be set through the control panel. Once activated, the oven will notify the user when it has reached the desired temperature but can be interrupted if necessary.

**Cooking with Convection**

When using the convection feature, ensure that air circulation is not obstructed and that cookware adheres to specific guidelines. Adjustments might be needed depending on the type of food being cooked, particularly ensuring that thicker items allow for proper heat distribution.

Always monitor cooking times and adjust according to the features in use. For best results, familiarize yourself with the provided charts and guidelines to maximize cooking efficiency. Remember that safety is crucial, particularly when handling grease or high temperatures.

The feature enables the use of the Convection Bake option for optimal cooking performance. It is important to prepare food items according to the recommended guidelines, ensuring even heating throughout. Note that you can cancel the cooking process at any time. To initiate, set the oven to 350°F (176°C) by pressing UPPER OVEN, followed by CONV BAKE, and then START. When the display indicates PRE-HEATING, allow the oven to reach the desired temperature before cooking. 

For Convection Roasting, follow specific instructions to ensure proper cooking of meats, including poultry. The oven is designed to reduce cooking time by circulating heat evenly around the food. Preheat according to the recommended procedures outlined, and always use the provided charts for guidance. 

To ensure meat is cooked accurately, use a food probe to check internal temperatures, remembering that different types of meat have varying required cooking temperatures. Specific guidelines include ensuring the probe is placed in the thickest part of the meat without touching bone. 

For defrosting, utilize the Defrost setting for effective thawing of foods. The Convection feature facilitates even heating, allowing for proper thawing without cooking the food. 

When proofing yeast-based products, maintain a warm setting around 100°F (38°C) to encourage rising. 

Remember to follow the provided instructions for selecting various cooking options and settings. You can save and retrieve favorite cooking configurations for consistency and efficiency.
