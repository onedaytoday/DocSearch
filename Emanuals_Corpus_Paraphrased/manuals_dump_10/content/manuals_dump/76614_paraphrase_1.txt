**Charge Ready Indicator**: When the flashes are activated, they will cycle through firing and recycling. To toggle the Charge Ready (ON/OFF) LED, press for more than two seconds. An active Charge Ready LED indicates readiness, while an inactive one means it is off. Pressing for over two seconds will display A.X (where X corresponds to Flash Power settings). The system will revert after a few seconds of being pressed.

**EL-Wireless Interface**: The system can be customized and turned off by pressing the buttons simultaneously, showing advanced options with the flash disabled. Access Group G.1 with the Prop/Free settings, allowing for channel selection using G.1 through G.4. After a few seconds, pressing buttons together again takes you back to advanced settings, moving to F.1 for interference options with other devices. Additional options can be selected from F.1 to F.8.

**Safety Instructions**: If the ON/OFF switch shows an indicator, power it down immediately if overheating is suspected or if there are visible damages like cracking. Turn off the power to cool the unit. Ensure safety measures are in place, as improper handling could lead to risk. Always use the correct protection and insulation for security. If issues arise during operation, like E1 or E2, consult Elinchrom service for troubleshooting. Overheating should prompt a switch-off; while the unit recharges, ensure you’re attentive to the cooling fan's operation.

**Technical Specifications**: This device adheres to EN and CE standards while functioning with BX specifications (ISO, J(Ws) supply). It features integrated cooling for optimal performance.

**Battery Installation**: Ensure correct placement of the Lithium battery in the hot-shoe connector. The battery life lasts up to six months or over 30,000 flashes, accommodating a maximum sync output of 3V. Always secure the battery compartment and avoid any potential for short circuits.

**RX Features**: The RX module allows for smooth operation with the EL-Skyport software. It features a power reduction channel selector, several modes including Group settings, and compatibility with digits for high sync speeds.

**SPEED Function**: This new wireless EL-SkyportTransmitter operates at a frequency of 2.4GHz with high security and performance for SLR cameras. To configure, hold the test button while switching on the transmitter to enter specific modes. Check the EL-Skyport software for additional settings, such as adjusting power-saving features.

**Troubleshooting**: If errors occur, verify connections, ensure frequency and group settings match, and check the power status. Reposition devices to mitigate distance-related issues and guarantee the transmitter is active.

**USB RX Module**: For RX flash units to work via computer, ensure the USB module is used alongside the EL-Skyport software. In cases of malfunction, follow the troubleshooting guide to resolve connectivity issues quickly.
