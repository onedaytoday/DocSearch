Sure! Here’s a paraphrased version of the text:

To cook thick meat, use high heat ranging from 300°F to 550°F. Preheating the broiler enhances browning, so season the food, turn it as needed, and be aware that the high temperatures can cause grease to ignite. Avoid covering the meat while broiling, as it could catch fire. If flames occur, use a fire extinguisher or throw a damp cloth to extinguish them.

For convection cooking, the temperature can also range from 170°F to 550°F, usually set at around 350°F. This method circulates hot air continuously, which helps cook food evenly while reducing cooking time. Preheat the convection oven as necessary, and adjust cooking times based on the type and amount of food being prepared.

When convection roasting, maintain heat within the same range. Ensure that food is securely placed in the oven to prevent drips that could lead to fires. Always follow the recommended temperatures for different types of meat and poultry to ensure safe cooking.

If using the keep warm feature, the oven should maintain a range of 150°F to 190°F. This setting is ideal for slowly warming food without drying it out. Use a food thermometer to check that the food remains at safe temperatures to avoid overcooking.

For proofing dough, the lowest heat setting (85°F to 100°F) should be used to activate yeast. Preheat your oven and allow sufficient time for the dough to rise adequately.

To access preferred cooking settings or the "My Favorites" function, press the relevant buttons. Alternatively, you can reset user preferences through the control panel. If using during the Sabbath, be aware of specific operational guidelines to conform to restrictions.

Always refer to the specific cooking instructions for various methods and settings to ensure optimal results.

### Preferences and Clock Operation

**Clock Settings:** Access the clock function in the hour of operation section. If the power supply is interrupted, the clock will flash. To adjust, press "USER PREF" to access the clock settings. Use the buttons to set the time until you press "START" to save your changes and return to the main menu.

**Temperature Settings:** To change temperature preferences, press "USER PREF" and select Fahrenheit (F) or Celsius (C). The factory default is 35°F. After adjusting, press "START" to confirm and return to preferences.

### Self-Cleaning Instructions

**Preparation for Self-Cleaning:** Ensure the oven is turned off and cooled. Wear protective gear during cleaning. Avoid using harsh chemicals or protective coatings around the self-clean feature. Remove racks before starting the process. Clean with a damp cloth or fire-resistant material. 

**During Self-Cleaning:** The self-cleaning cycle heats to high temperatures to eliminate food residues. Allow about one hour for the cycle to complete. Once finished, a flashing door light indicates that the oven is cooling down. Wait for the door lock to disengage before attempting to open it.

### General Cleaning Guidelines

**Regular Maintenance:** Clean spills and heavy soil as soon as possible to minimize future cleaning. Light cleaning is advised for decorative surfaces, using gentle wipes. Avoid abrasive cleaners to prevent surface damage.

**Safety Precautions:** Keep children away during the self-clean cycle. Ensure that the oven is completely cooled before handling. Use a screwdriver to unlock if necessary, and follow the manufacturer's recommendations for specific cleaning methods.

**Preheating and Cooking:** Always preheat the oven when cooking certain items like breads or cakes. Monitor cooking progress to avoid overcrowding, which can affect temperature and cooking times. Adjust as needed to prevent warping or overheating. For guidance, contact service support at 1-877-4ELECTR.
