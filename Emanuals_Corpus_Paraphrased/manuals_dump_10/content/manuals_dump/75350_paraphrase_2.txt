### EOG

**Introduction**

This document is aligned with Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It serves to provide comprehensive guidance for proper use, maintenance, and safety procedures related to cooking appliances. It is essential to adhere to the provided instructions for optimal functionality and safety when cooking food and other items. The instructions relate to specific features and components of the appliance that must be followed diligently.

If these guidelines are not followed, it may lead to improper use or safety hazards. The ratings and specifications include information to ensure that all components function correctly. The document includes detailed instructions for servicing, cooling, lighting, and cooking procedures.

**Operational Guidelines**

Follow these directives closely. Regular servicing and maintenance as indicated are crucial for optimal operation. Ensure that the supply of power is appropriately managed, including the height and location of cooking surfaces. Always monitor the appliance's output and mechanical settings to avoid overheating or operational inefficiencies.

Take care when handling food items, especially those prone to ignition. Maintaining cleanliness around the housing and ensuring proper functioning is vital for food safety. 

**Lighting and Heating**

When powered on, the lighting should function correctly. The high and low settings are indicated, and different foods may require adjustments in temperature. For example, thicker foods will generally require higher heat settings at first, followed by regular monitoring and stirring.

**Cooking Procedures**

Position food directly on the specified shelves, considering the required heating patterns. Preheating is crucial for certain items like Yorkshire puddings or baked goods. The positioning of shelves impacts cooking efficiency, and it is recommended to organize items according to size and heating requirements.

**Roasting Guidelines**

For optimal roasting results, items should be placed on the correct shelves while considering their need for covering to prevent uneven cooking. Thoroughly thaw meat and ensure proper placement within the oven for even heat distribution.

**Reheating Instructions**

Proper techniques for reheating food should be followed to avoid undercooked sections or overheating. Ensure that foods are reheated only once.

**Timing and Clock Functions**

This section elucidates the hourly settings on the clock, providing clear guidance on adjusting and using the timer features effectively for cooking operations. Ensure that settings are correctly engaged for accurate time management in cooking processes.

### Installation Instructions for Appliance and Cabinet

**Note:** Ensure that the appliance is properly earthed and that it is fitted correctly into the designated cabinet space. Carefully follow both the electrical and gas supply instructions outlined in the respective sections, paying special attention to the right-hand side of the assembly. Use the specified screws to secure the appliance, attaching them from the back.

The electrical supply must be connected according to the "B.S.P." standard, with the cable directed upwards through the supply section. Make sure the supply is isolated as necessary.

### Warning:
Take care when connecting to the supply to avoid becoming trapped or creating hazards as you work. Follow these guidelines to prevent any issues during installation. 

If there are any heating elements, ensure they are positioned at the front and securely fastened with the four designated screws. Tighten all fittings appropriately.

#### Connection to Electricity Supply
**Warning:** The electricity supply must be earthed and connected to a 220V-240V circuit. If using a different voltage, ensure the appropriate transformer or board is installed. Employ molded fittings and do not extend cables with plastic or ceramic connection blocks or insulation tape.

If the appliance is wired inside the house, connect the wires as follows:

- Brown (Live) → L terminal (Red)
- Blue (Neutral) → N terminal (Black)
- Green and Yellow (Earth) → E or Earth terminal

A suitable fuse must be fitted to the plug holder.

### Pressure Testing
Access the pressure testing point located on the appliance by turning the thermostat anti-clockwise. Activate the electricity supply and verify the operations before proceeding further. 

**Note:** Ensure the supply is secure during the pressure test.

### Appliance Reassembly Instructions
#### A. Removal of Fascia Panel
Detach the fascia panel by removing the four screws located at the top. Be cautious of any top mounts becoming detached during this process.

#### B. Removal of Oven Door
To remove the oven door, slightly adjust it while disengaging it from its mounts. 

#### Checking the Grill
Ensure the grill ignites properly. If it has a switch that cuts off the supply when the door is closed, verify that it operates correctly. 

### Setting the Time of Day
To set the clock, turn the thermostat to the off position and adjust the clock by rotating it to the right.

### Checking the Main Oven
Ensure the main oven operates correctly by checking if the lights illuminate once the thermostat is turned on. The flame safety device (F.S.D.) should activate, indicating proper gas flow.
