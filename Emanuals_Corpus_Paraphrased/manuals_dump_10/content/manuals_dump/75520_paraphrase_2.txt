**B: Insulation Check**  
Rectify the insulation as necessary.  
**TAPS, IGNITOR SWITCHES, IGNITOR UNIT PLUG** (with Earth Carry cover)

**C: Polarity Check**  
**A. EARTH CONTINUITY CHECK**  
Ensure the appliance is electrically disconnected. Verify that the leads from the earth are tight and correctly connected.   

**B. INSULATION CHECK**  
Ensure the appliance is electrically disconnected and switches are ON. Check the leads; if the readings show less than acceptable values (indicating continuity), further inspection is required until the issue is resolved. Should any signs of burning or arcing be identified, check visually for burn marks around the socket and fuse. The electricity supply is to be verified as satisfactory.

**Carry D: Earth Polarity**  
Confirm earth polarity from 'N' (Neutral) and 'O' (Operational) to 'L' (Live) across each switch terminal. Check the insulation integrity of the HT leads from the switches to the supply. Manually check the light operation.

**Commissioning Procedure**  
To commence, follow the steps below:  
- Set the control to MAX and the other to MIN.  
- Shift from MIN to MAX.  
- If the light is extinguished, follow the procedures outlined below.  
- Use a thin screwdriver to adjust the appropriate screws, ensuring that steady operation resumes when transitioning from MIN to MAX.  
- The calibration screw is located on the injector or within its housing.  
- Ensure the supply is turned off for safety during this process.

**Important: Conversion from Natural Gas to LPG**  
Confirm that the conversion complies with standards and that all adaptors and injectors are suitable for LPG use. Set the injectors to their OFF position before making modifications. Once fitted, check the proper functioning of the LPG injectors.
