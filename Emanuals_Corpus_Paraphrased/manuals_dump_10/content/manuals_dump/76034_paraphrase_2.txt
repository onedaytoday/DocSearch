### Instructions for Use

Thank you for selecting this cleaner. These instructions explain its features and functionalities. 

**Hose and Combination Upholstery Nozzle**  
Ensure the hose is properly insulated and earthed. This cleaner can be used for both maintenance and repairs. Utilize the authorized service centers for these tasks. Care should be taken to avoid any contact with combustible materials or ash, as damage from such incidents is not covered under warranty. 

**Warranty Information**  
The warranty only applies to specific components of the cleaner. Access to the front cover and other areas should not compromise the warranty. Regular cleaning or replacing of parts such as the hose is recommended to maintain performance.

**Suction Power**  
To optimize suction, attach the appropriate nozzle and use the hose efficiently. Make sure to adjust settings as necessary for various tasks, such as cleaning bookshelves or upholstery. 

**Cleaning Procedures**  
Ensure the cleaner is powered off when adjusting or cleaning components, including the waste container. The waste compartment must be emptied before it becomes too full to function properly. To maintain cleaning efficiency, regularly clean both the hose and the filter.

**Hose Management**  
If the hose becomes obstructed, disconnect and clear any blockages. The warranty covers issues caused by manufacturing defects; however, damage due to misuse will not be covered. 

**Troubleshooting**  
If problems arise, check that the cleaner is connected properly and verify that necessary parts are functioning. Should malfunctions continue, it is best to consult authorized service professionals. 

**Environmental Considerations**  
For recycling information, please contact your local waste management facility or the retailer from whom the cleaner was purchased. Proper disposal is essential for health and environmental safety.
