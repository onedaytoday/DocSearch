**Note:** For additional details and troubleshooting, refer to the Common Issues section in the manual.

**COOK TIME** enables the oven to automatically start and stop cooking. The timer display indicates when the oven will turn off after the countdown completes. This feature is compatible with Convection, Warm, Defrost, Proof, and Perfect cooking modes. To set the cooking temperature to 450°F, choose either the UPPER OVEN or LOWER OVEN. Press BAKE, followed by COOK OPTIONS to select your desired cooking settings. Press COOK TIME, then START to begin heating. The cooking progress will be tracked on the display. You can press CANCEL to stop cooking at any point.

**END TIME** allows you to set a specific time for the oven to turn off, with the timer display indicating when this will occur. This function also works with all cooking modes, including Convection, Warm, Defrost, Clean, and others. You should consider foods like meat or poultry for initial cooking, noting that cooking times should generally be monitored, especially for items cooked for longer than an hour, to avoid foodborne illnesses. 

In case of a fire, turn off the oven immediately. If flames occur, use a fire extinguisher or smother the fire, but do not attempt to douse it with water.

**BROILING** is effective for cooking thicker meats with high heat, ranging from 300°F to 550°F. Use this method for achieving a good browning effect. It is advisable to preheat and monitor your food closely while using this feature, and avoid covering the food to prevent grease fires.

For **CONVECTION BAKING**, the oven's fan helps distribute heat evenly, improving cooking efficiency for various types of food. The temperature range for this method is between 170°F and 550°F, with optimal results at around 350°F. Preheating is essential, and if your recipe requires alternate cooking times, utilize the Convection Convert feature for guidance on adjustments.

**RAPID PREHEAT** is designed for quickly bringing the oven to temperature before cooking. It’s meant for use with the bake function and works in conjunction with other cooking modes, warming up between 170°F and 550°F.

**SLOW COOKING** is a method for gently cooking foods, ideal for items like stews or roasts, with the option to choose high (HI) or low (LO) heat settings. Ensure food items are completely thawed before cooking for the best results.

**DEHYDRATING** involves slow heating to remove moisture from foods, with a temperature range of 100°F to 225°F. This method is suitable for drying fruits and vegetables.

**DEFROSTING** is designed to gradually thaw food items such as cakes or meats. It’s recommended to monitor the process closely to minimize the risk of bacterial growth. Select either the UPPER or LOWER oven, and press DEFROST to activate this feature, stopping the process as needed.

### Dough Proofing 

Proofing dough involves activating the yeast. Maintain a temperature range of 85°F to 100°F, ideally around 100°F. **Proofing Tips:** To prepare, preheat the oven to the lowest setting and allow the cavity to warm up. Let it heat for at least 5 minutes before using it for proofing. To set the oven, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN option and press the BREAD PROOF button, then press START. To stop proofing while it's active, press CANCEL. For quick adjustments, you can switch between the UPPER and LOWER OVEN selections.

### Perfect Turkey

When roasting turkey, precise cooking is essential. Ideal cooking temperatures range from 170°F to 550°F, typically around 325°F. **Perfect Turkey Tips:** Thaw the turkey thoroughly to ensure even cooking, and preheat the oven. Use a roasting pan that catches grease and allows for even heat circulation. For best results, position the oven rack correctly to accommodate the roast. To monitor cooking, select the UPPER or LOWER OVEN option, press PERFECT TURKEY, and optionally use the PROBE feature. Press START, and when the turkey reaches its internal temperature, it’ll notify you. To cancel, press CANCEL.

### Temperature Probe

The temperature probe helps check the internal temperature of meats and roasts for proper doneness. This feature works with Convection cooking and can be set between 130°F and 210°F, with recommended cooking temperatures around 170°F. **Important:** Ensure the probe is placed correctly, ideally in the thickest part of the meat away from the bone. For best results, make sure food is fully defrosted before cooking. The outlet for the probe is typically located at the front of the appliance.

### Multi-Stage Cooking

Multi-Stage cooking allows for a series of cooking processes in one session. This includes selections for Convection and Proofing. To initiate Multi-Stage, select either UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press MULTI STAGE, choose a cooking method, and follow the prompts. Press START when ready. If needed, you can cancel the current cycle anytime.

### User Preferences

This section covers customizable user options, such as clock settings and baking preferences. To access, press USER PREF and navigate through options like Continuous Bake, Hour Clock, or No-Clock settings. To set the clock after a power interruption, follow the prompts after selecting the appropriate option. Adjusting oven temperature settings may also be done here.

### Sabbath Feature

The Sabbath feature is specifically designed for Jewish Sabbath observance. It maintains the oven at a set temperature without the use of any alert tones. Once activated, the oven light remains on. You can select either UPPER or LOWER OVEN, choose the BAKE option, and set the desired temperature. Note that other functions should not be used during this period. To stop or modify settings, follow the appropriate instructions.

### SABBATH FEATURE (CONTINUED)

To start, press UPPER OVEN and then OVEN BAKE at 425°F, followed by pressing START twice. If you wish to turn it off, press CANCEL. The oven will automatically turn off after a set period. To resume, press and hold both HI and LO for a few seconds. Food can be kept warm during the Sabbath, but must be turned back on when needed.

### USING THE SELF-CLEAN FEATURE

**Cleaning Precautions**
Allow the oven to cool before cleaning. Wear appropriate safety gear while performing manual cleaning. Keep children away during the self-cleaning cycle. Do not use chemicals or protectants that can damage the self-cleaning function. 

**Self-Cleaning Instructions**
To utilize the self-clean feature, ensure that the oven cavity is free of food debris that can ignite at high temperatures. Avoid cleaning with harsh materials or chemicals that might lead to scratches or damage. Shut off the oven and use a wet cloth to wipe down surfaces. 

**Starting the Self-Clean Cycle**
Begin the cycle after ensuring the oven is empty. The process typically lasts about one hour. Press CLEAN and select a cleaning duration based on the oven type—lighter settings for minimal cleaning and heavier ones for deep cleaning. The door will automatically lock during the cycle, and the indicator light will flash until the cycle is complete.

### GENERAL CLEANING

Perform regular cleaning sessions by removing spills and heavy soiling promptly. This prevents the need for extensive future cleanings. Use soft cloths and non-abrasive cleaners for painted, decorative, and chrome parts to avoid scratching. Always turn off the oven before cleaning any exterior surfaces.

### OVEN LIGHT

The oven light activates when the door is closed and can be operated via the light switch. The glass shield must always be in place during operation. Ensure the oven is cool before removing the shield for cleaning.

### BROILER PAN CLEANING TIPS

After cooking, clean the broiler pan promptly to remove grease. Avoid covering it while cooking to ensure optimal results. Use care when using scouring pads that may scratch surfaces.

### COOKING TIPS

When preheating, keep an eye on the temperature to avoid overcrowding, which can lead to uneven cooking. Adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the recipe to achieve the best results.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

In case of issues such as error codes or the oven not operating, follow proper troubleshooting steps or contact an authorized service provider. Ensure connections to the power supply are secure.

This is a brief overview of cleaning and operating instructions for your oven. For detailed troubleshooting or feature usage, please refer to the user manual.
