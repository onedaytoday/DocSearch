To position the system correctly around the obstruction, apply the coating appropriately. If adjustments are necessary, ensure that coal-burning areas are orientated correctly. Below, details about the hoses and their connections are outlined. It is essential to note that these aspects may become critical in case of malfunction. Use the smallest possible beam thickness with screws for assembly. When securing the corners, pay attention to the water source and the connection of the hoses to the heater.

The installation must comply with local authority regulations regarding height and positioning of the hoses. Ensure the hoses are connected correctly to avoid any operational issues. The hoses should maintain a certain internal diameter, and the connection points must be higher than the overall system for proper functioning. 

Ensure that the hoses used for drainage or discharge follow the correct path to avoid contamination. In case of direct connections, use caution and remember that the appliance must be properly earthed.
