**Cooling Functionality Overview**

To engage the cooling options, select the desired settings on the display. The system will automatically shut off after a specified inactivity period, typically within the first few seconds, with a notification sound indicating high temperature status ("HI"). If you need to turn off the cooling feature, press the appropriate button. 

The Wave-Touch™ and IQ-Touch™ controls allow for easy operation; however, they must remain compliant with health guidelines when activated. During the Sabbath mode, the unit operates without additional interference and will return to its normal function once closed.

**Water and Ice Dispensing**

To toggle ice and water dispensing, press and hold the designated buttons for three seconds. The system features an automatic freeze rate adjustment. If the water supply is disconnected, the system may not operate correctly.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

Regular cleaning of the components is crucial for optimal performance. Always disconnect the power before cleaning with specific products to avoid damage. The shelves are designed for simple accessibility and can accommodate a range of food items while maintaining high humidity levels for optimal freshness. 

**Notes on Features**

This paraphrase maintains the technical specificity while clarifying the functions and guidelines.

**Food Storage and Maintenance Guidelines:**

It is essential to avoid overcrowding shelves in food storage areas to enhance the cooling efficiency and prevent improper ventilation. Ensure that food items, especially meat and poultry, are stored securely, either together or separately, to maintain freshness. The storage unit operates optimally when there’s ample space, allowing air to circulate around the food.

When organizing meat and other perishables, items should be placed in airtight containers to prolong freshness and prevent freezer burn. Make sure the products are fully loaded to ensure efficient cooling. Additionally, avoid placing food items directly under sunlight, as this can lead to heat buildup.

**Operational Sounds and Maintenance:**

Pay attention to the sounds generated during the appliance's operation, such as the hissing of the defrost heater or clicking noises when cooling starts and stops. These sounds are generally indicative of normal functioning. Should you hear unusual noises, such as high-pitched tones, it may signal an issue with the cooling system. 

**Water Usage and Cartridge Replacement:**

The PureAdvantage™ water filtration system is NSF certified and designed to perform effectively in reducing contaminants. Ensure you follow the provided guidelines for cartridge installation and regular maintenance to maximize performance. The water supply should be connected and sufficiently pressurized to avoid disruptions.

After unpacking, thoroughly check for protective coverings and connect the water supply securely. The system light will indicate readiness for use.

**Cleaning and Care:**

To maintain the appliance's appearance and functionality, immediate cleaning is recommended to remove any buildup without using aggressive scouring agents. Only use non-abrasive cloths and cleaning solutions free from bleach or chorine. Avoid immersing removable parts in a dishwasher or using excessive water around electrical components.

For maintaining LED lights, ensure the light covers are properly secured and that the lights face the correct direction to optimize illumination inside the storage area. Should you need to replace the LED lights, refer to wattage specifications and ensure safety precautions are in place. 

**Common Issues and Resolutions:**

In case of any operational problems—such as lights not functioning—first check the food distribution and ensure items are not blocking the light. If the cooling system is inactive, check for blown fuses or trip switches. Regular maintenance and inspections will prevent blockages and ensure optimal performance, including the timely removal of stale ice from the icemaker to ensure fresh supplies are produced. 

Should you encounter difficulties with the water supply or ice production, confirm that the supply is unobstructed and correctly connected. Regular checks and cleanings are essential for efficient operation.

The refrigerator is experiencing issues related to temperature settings and conditions. The appliance has recently been disconnected, resulting in the automatic ice maker functioning incorrectly. If the refrigerator is too cold, adjustments should be made in the fresh food section, allowing the unit a full 24 hours to stabilize. Ensure that air circulation is not obstructed by food or containers when the door is closed. 

For water-related concerns, accumulation of moisture or frost might indicate a warmer temperature setting or a blockage in the water supply line. The unit should be properly connected to the cold water supply. If the water source has high mineral content, it may affect taste and odor. Adjustments and maintenance, such as regular cleaning and optimal humidity control, are advisable to prevent excessive moisture build-up. 

The warranty covers certain aspects, but excludes service calls due to misuse or damage from unauthorized repairs. It limits liability for incidental damages and emphasizes specific remedies for repair or replacement under the warranty terms. This warranty may vary by state, so check local regulations for additional rights. For service needs, contact the authorized service provider listed in the warranty details.
