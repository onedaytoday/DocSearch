**VMAX Projection Screen User Guidance**

For installation and operation, adhere strictly to the guidelines provided by Elite Screens. Unauthorized modifications or installations void the warranty. Ensure the unit is properly grounded to prevent the risk of electrical shock or fire. It is crucial to use the correct power supply as using an inadequate power cord may lead to overheating.

Avoid exposing the screen to extreme conditions (e.g., strong winds or direct sunlight) to prevent damage. If any power supply issues arise, disconnect it immediately. 

**Installation Advisory**
Please follow professional installation practices. The screen must be securely mounted on a sturdy surface, ensuring all mounting screws are appropriate for the wall material. Optional wall brackets may be used for added stability. 

**Remote Control & Operation**
The VMAX features a built-in 5-12V input for seamless integration with wall switches and infrared (IR) remotes. Ensure the remote's line of sight to the screen is unobstructed for optimal operation. 

**Maintenance & Troubleshooting**
Regularly check the device for dust accumulation. It should be cleaned comfortably with a soft cloth. Use only recommended AAA batteries for the remote. In case of functionality issues, or if you wish to manually operate the unit, refer to the troubleshooting FAQ section. 

**Warranty Information**
The product comes with a three-year warranty against workmanship defects for new units, while refurbished units are covered for 90 days. For warranty claims, ensure that the request is made within the stipulated reporting period. More details, including RMA procedures, are available at www.elitescreens.com/warranty.
