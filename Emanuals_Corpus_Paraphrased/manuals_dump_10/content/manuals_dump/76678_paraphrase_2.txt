**Quick User Guide**

**Screen A**: To mount the screen, position it on the wall where you intend to install it. The mounting holes should be located approximately one inch from the edge. The mounting brackets are at the back—one on the right side—of the screen and are included in this installation kit. Use the provided anchors and screws for installation. If you prefer an alternative mounting method, refer to **Screen B**, which utilizes chains (also included).

**Operation**: To operate the screen, pull it down or retract it smoothly. Ensure it is aligned properly for optimal functionality. When retracting, do so slowly without releasing the tension on the housing. The screen should not exceed the specified size of an inch and should align with the wrist and back of the housing. If resistance is encountered, apply gentle force to straighten it out.
