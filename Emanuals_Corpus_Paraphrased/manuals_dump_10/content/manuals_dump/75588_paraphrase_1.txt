The cooling system comprises units operating at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C, featuring various thicknesses. They are equipped with built-in or external components and utilize pre-charged refrigerants, ensuring robust performance and high efficiency. The units are constructed with insulation that is both prepainted and free from CFC and HCFC. Internal corners are rounded to enhance airflow and usability.

The quick-fit design promotes easy installation and features airtight PVC elements. Capable of operating effectively under ambient temperatures up to +43°C and utilizing R404A refrigerant, these units deliver reliable performance with high and low settings. The defrosting function utilizes heated elements to minimize frost buildup and maximize energy efficiency, enhanced by internal lighting (rated IP54) and controlled by an ON/OFF switch as well as a thermostat.

The right-hinged door comes with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring durability and ease of access while maintaining airtightness and superior insulation to optimize operational efficiency. The system complies with HACCP standards and offers a range of shelving options as accessories.
