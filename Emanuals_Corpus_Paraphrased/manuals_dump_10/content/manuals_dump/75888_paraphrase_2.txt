### Food Cooling and FROSTMATIC Function

Allow food to cool before storing. The warmth enhances ice formation and improves food preservation. Place specified food items in airtight containers to prevent moisture loss and avoid cross-contamination with other foods. The FROSTMATIC feature can operate for a designated duration, typically between hours, with indicator lights showing its status. This function can be manually switched off after use; the yellow light indicates its operation. Once the FROSTMATIC feature is turned off, the device resumes normal settings.

### Tips for Effective Storage

To prepare ice cubes, use the designated trays for a few seconds to detach them easily. Ensure frost covers are managed properly during defrosting by following cleaning and defrosting guidelines. Regularly checking and managing frost buildup is crucial; typically, defrosting should occur once frost reaches a certain thickness.

### Safety Warnings

Exercise caution when defrosting or performing maintenance to avoid injury or appliance damage. Always adhere to recommended operating instructions; failure to do so may impact both health and appliance integrity.

### Cleaning Instructions

When cleaning, ensure the FROSTMATIC function is switched off and the appliance is disconnected from the power supply. Use a cloth and recommended cleansers to wipe down surfaces, ensuring thorough cleanliness while avoiding any electrical hazards. Clean food storage areas regularly to maintain optimal hygiene and appliance performance.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions

Refer to the operational manual for guidance on addressing malfunctions. If issues arise, such as a malfunctioning light or improper cooling, check connections and settings as suggested. For any persistent problems, consult a certified service technician.

In case of unusual sounds during appliance operation, such as clicking or water splashing, note that these are typical functions during cooling cycles. Ensure compliance with relevant safety standards and regulations during use.

### Technical Specifications

The cooling system efficiently maintains temperature by removing heat from the food and redistributing it to the environment. This system is typically installed in accessible areas for maintenance and operation. Always ensure the appliance is positioned correctly to facilitate proper airflow and cooling efficiency.
