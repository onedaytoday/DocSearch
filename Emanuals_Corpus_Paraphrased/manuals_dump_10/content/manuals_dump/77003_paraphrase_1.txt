Connect the AC power supply and make adjustments via the DIP switch as outlined. To switch between operating modes, toggle the DIP switch to the OFF position, setting supply adjustments accordingly. For initial setups, select NTSC for RGB output, or connect to the appropriate outputs based on attached devices.

### LCD Mounting Instructions

To position the LCD correctly, turn off the switch and ensure the setup is ready. Apply force gently to release the mount. Ensure that lighting adjustments are made as indicated.

### Operation Procedures

To power on, switch the device on. The LED indicators on the front will represent the status of each function. If the switch is turned off immediately after activation, the device may need to restart after a brief pause. Use the front or wireless buttons to control functions such as zoom and focus.

### Lighting Operations

For lighting control, use the [LAMP] button on the front or the [LAMP BASE] button on the remote to turn on the illumination. To deactivate, press the same buttons again. The lighting function can be adjusted alongside various operation modes.

### Functionality and Operations

To engage different functions, use the corresponding front or wireless buttons. Each selection influences the device's operations, and continuous pressing modifies function performance. Various inputs can be connected, and selection can be made either manually or remotely without interrupting the process.

### Input Polarity and Clock Configurations

Adjust the VGA input connections as needed, ensuring the polarity is set correctly (negative settings). The setup allows for clock synchronization and compatibility with different display types.

### B&W Selection and Image Adjustment

Using the [COLOR/B&W] button, switch between color and black-and-white output. Functions such as POSI (positive) and NEGA (negative) are modifiable using the respective buttons, allowing for image enhancements. 

### Image Rotation Functionality

When the [IMAGE ROTATION] button is pressed, the display rotates counterclockwise. This function is essential for aligning the image properly, depending on the current setup. 

For further assistance with operation and setup, please refer to the specified pages in the manual.
