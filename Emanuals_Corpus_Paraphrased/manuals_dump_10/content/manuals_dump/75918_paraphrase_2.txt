### BUILDING-IN

This section pertains to the installation of the cooker, focusing on the radiated heat emitted from below it. Without proper heat shielding, the performance can suffer significantly. Thus, the unit should typically be oriented south, as it is subject to heat and combustion emissions from the vehicle’s environment. If the area beneath the vehicle is not adequately covered, it could hinder cooling efficiency, ultimately reducing performance.

#### TECHNICAL DATA

The installation details for the unit highlight that it should fit seamlessly into the designated recess at the front. The unit must be secured with screws that can withstand the operational forces within the vehicle. Ensure that there is enough clearance as specified. If additional adjustments are required, insulation materials (like PU) could be beneficial.

### VENTILATION OF THE UNIT

Proper ventilation is crucial, especially during high temperatures. Air should circulate freely through the unit and the designated recess, allowing for optimal cooling, ideally maintaining a temperature as shown in the specified diagrams.

For accessibility, it should allow easy inspection and repair without requiring removal from the recess. External barriers may be necessary to protect the vents from debris or environmental exposure. When not in use, winterization measures should seal off outdoor outlets appropriately.

### TECHNICAL DATA

#### I. LP GAS CONNECTION

The refrigerator operates on LP gas, and it is vital to verify that the gas pressure matches the specified requirements, as indicated by the reducing valve on the container. The gas supply should be securely connected to the type suitable for continuous operation.

**Important Safety Note:** Ensure that push-on connections are avoided, and all fittings are robustly threaded and sealed. The installation should comply with local regulations, particularly regarding LPG connections.

#### ELECTRICAL CONNECTION

All electrical installations must adhere to current I.E.E. regulations, including using proper outlets and connectors. The system should be correctly earthed and fused.

**Wiring Colors:**
- Green and Yellow: Earth
- Blue: Neutral
- Brown: Live

Ensure that the connections align with their corresponding terminal colors. Additionally, safety precautions necessitate proper earthing of the appliance, especially when connected to higher voltage sources.

The supply wires must be routed responsibly, connecting directly to the battery and incorporating necessary relays for operational safety.

### SUMMARY

This outline provides critical information on the installation and connectivity of the cooker unit, ensuring optimal performance and safety conformance throughout. Ensure all components are securely installed to facilitate effective operation.
