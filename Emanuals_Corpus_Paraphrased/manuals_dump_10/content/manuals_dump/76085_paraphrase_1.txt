**Accessories and Safety Precautions (Z4590 and Z4520)**

Ensure that the vacuum cleaner is properly earthed, and do not force the cover shut, as this could lead to serious damage and void the warranty. For issues related to service and repairs, only authorized personnel should be consulted. Disconnect the vacuum from the power supply before cleaning it or addressing any issues.

**Before Use:**  
Check that the hose is securely attached and that you hear a click when connected. To operate, press the On/Off switch with your foot. Adjust suction settings as needed for different surfaces such as carpets and shelves.

**Replacing the Dustbag:**  
Change the dustbag when it reaches full capacity. If you experience suction problems while cleaning, inspect the hose and the cover for clogs. Follow proper cleaning guidelines to maintain efficiency, ensuring the dustbag is emptied and replaced as necessary.

**Cleaning the Hose and Nozzle:**  
If the hose becomes blocked, allow it to cool and clear any obstructions. Regular cleaning will help maintain suction power. Ensure the hose is free of any debris to prevent damage, and refer to the warranty for information regarding service coverage.

**Troubleshooting and Customer Support:**  
If issues arise, verify that the vacuum is properly connected to the power supply. Any repairs required should be addressed by authorized service technicians. Always refer to customer support resources for guidance on maintenance and service inquiries.

**Electrical Supply Instructions:**  
Ensure correct electrical connections according to recommended guidelines. Use appropriate wiring and connectors, clearly noting the colour codes for installation. Ensure all connections are secure to prevent fire hazards. 

**Safety Warnings:**  
Read all instructions thoroughly prior to using your vacuum cleaner. To minimize the risk of fire or electric shock, keep the unit out of reach of children and avoid using it with incompatible attachments. Never use the cord near heated surfaces or with an overloaded outlet.
