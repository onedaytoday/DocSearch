**Elinchrom Product Guidance**

Elinchrom has years of professional experience and consistently supplies high-quality products. The 196V, 100W model can be upgraded to a higher output of 150W. When using this model, ensure the appropriate screw-in light type is applied. Maintain all components according to the manufacturer's warranty guidelines.

For safety, avoid touching the unit while itâ€™s operational, and ensure reflectors are securely attached before use. Regular maintenance of Elinchrom models 250C and 500C is essential; allow sufficient time for components to cool completely before handling. Carefully unscrew and realign the head component to ensure proper seating.

**Troubleshooting**  
If the unit does not function, first switch it ON and then OFF. If issues persist, check the ON/OFF switch. It might be defective or faulty. Note that certain components are not user-serviceable; therefore, for repairs or servicing, contact an authorized Elinchrom service provider.

**Safety Warnings**  
It is critical to never open your compact flash unit. High voltage can be present internally, and only a qualified service engineer should undertake repairs. If you encounter malfunctions, please return the unit to your authorized Elinchrom agent for assistance.

**Operational Instructions**  
When using the Elinchrom system, always ensure grounding and avoid obstructing vents to prevent overheating. Make sure all components maintain a clear area around them for ventilation. Remember, electrical energy storage in capacitors is inherent in the flash systems, posing a risk if mishandled.

**Usage Tips**  
Use the protective cover when not in use to prevent damage. Properly mount reflectors and other light-shaping accessories using the locking mechanism. Ensure all equipment is secured before operation. Always handle with caution to optimize performance and ensure safety.
