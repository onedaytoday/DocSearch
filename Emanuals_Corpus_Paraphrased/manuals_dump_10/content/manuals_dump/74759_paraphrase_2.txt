Here’s a technical paraphrase that maintains the original meaning:

To cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C effectively reduces bacterial growth. This process is essential for safely holding food at refrigeration temperatures before freezing it down to -18°C for extended storage, typically up to four months. The chilling modes include Soft Chilling and Shock Chilling, allowing rapid cooling to +3°C or -18°C, respectively. The system operates in compliance with UK and NF regulations and features built-in UV options for additional sanitation. It also includes defrosting capabilities, with displays providing countdowns and service indicators.

Cooling performance can achieve a temperature drop from +90°C to +3°C in less than four hours. Design specifications include AISI stainless steel construction with high-density polyurethane insulation and a thickness optimized for HCFC-free operation. The unit is equipped with safety features like IP20 protection, rounded corners for hygienic cleaning, and a thermostatic system for heated defrosting.

Installation options include plumbing as required, while also offering an optional HACCP compliance kit. The equipment is certified under NF hygiene standards by AFAQ AFNOR CERTIFICATION, ensuring conformity with the required quality and thermal performance standards.
