**DUV1000 Overview**
The DUV1000 is a dual-function device that operates as both an IP telephone and a PSTN phone. It uses standard protocols such as SIP and H.323 to facilitate low-cost calls, including STD and ISD. In addition to these functionalities, the DUV1000 supports the integration of PSTN and dial-up services, allowing users to access information seamlessly. The device is designed to be easily configurable with various Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telephone services of the user's choice. It supports multiple audio codecs (G.723 or G.729A) for optimal performance with low latency and hands-free operation, ensuring data transmission security.
