### Hints and Tips for Effective Cooking

When using the shelves, position food centrally on the shelf and arrange trays or dishes to maximize space and minimize cleaning. Proper placement reduces the chance of browning. For better heat distribution and browning, utilize enamelware or heavy cookware and avoid overly shiny surfaces. Centering food on standard shelves allows heat to circulate freely during cooking.

### Cooking Chart Guidelines

Use the chart below for optimal cooking positions in the main and top ovens. Always refer to specific instructions for each dish, including items like meringues, shortbread, or roast meats. Adjust cooking times according to the shelf's position from the top.

**Roasting Chart**: Follow the recommended internal temperatures and cooking times for different types of meat. Ensure food is properly covered to facilitate even cooking.

- Internal temperatures: 
  - 50-60°C
  - 60-70°C
  - 70-80°C.
  
All meats should be cooked at 160-180°C.

### Slow Cooking Recommendations

Slow cooking is ideal for tougher cuts of meat, making it economical and effective. The process typically takes longer but yields tender results. Aim to cook meats at a minimum temperature of 88°C. For soups, casseroles, and stews, bring ingredients to a simmer and cover tightly.

**General Points for Slow Cooking**: Always thaw food thoroughly before cooking. You may thicken dishes using cornflour to prevent curdling. Ensure food is reheated only once for safety.

### Care and Cleaning Guidelines

For cleaning, allow surfaces to cool first. Use recommended cleaning materials that won’t damage finishes. Avoid bleach and harsh chemicals. Clean the exterior gently and ensure control knobs are treated delicately to avoid dulling.

**Hotplate Maintenance**: Clean the hotplate and burner crowns and avoid scouring pads that can scratch surfaces.

**Replacing Hotplate Burner Parts**: When replacing crowns, ensure they’re positioned correctly and secured properly to avoid ignition issues.

### Oven Maintenance

The interior surfaces of the grill and oven compartments should be cleaned manually, as Stayclean coatings are effective for reducing residue. Avoid using aggressive cleaners that could damage finishes.

**Inner Glass Panel Cleaning**: Clean the inner glass panels using a soft cloth, especially if heavily soiled.

### Troubleshooting

If issues arise, consult the following common problems and solutions:

- Ensuring cooking operates correctly and uniformly.
- Address any unusual sounds or warnings during use.
- If failures continue, allow the appliance to cool, and inspect for electrical issues.
