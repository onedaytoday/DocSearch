## SIG and Instructions

### Introduction
This document outlines the usage and guidelines for British products in compliance with Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It includes detailed instructions intended for safe and effective food preparation. Users are encouraged to read through this guide thoroughly to understand proper operation.

### Rating Plate
The rating plate can be found either on the front of the unit or within the top cavity. It may also be located at the back or top of the appliance. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully for safe operation.

### Lighting the Hotplate
To light the hotplate, turn the control knob to the highest setting and ignite immediately. If a flame does not ignite, stop and ensure that the burner is turned off before attempting again. *Caution*: Should a fire occur, smother it with a cloth or use a fire extinguisher. Always observe safe practices while using the appliance.

### Cooking Instructions
1. **Heat Regulation**: Adjust the heat settings from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then to 'LOW' as needed based on the food being prepared. High heat is suitable for cooking items like toast, while low heat is ideal for thicker foods.
2. **Positioning Food**: Arrange food on the appropriate shelf to ensure even cooking. For foods that require optimal heat, position them in the center.
3. **Preheating**: Preheat the appliance as necessary, especially when cooking items like Yorkshire puddings or products requiring yeast. Correct positioning assists in achieving desired results.
4. **Roasting**: When roasting meats, covering them can help retain heat and moisture. Ensure even cooking by following appropriate guidelines for the type of food being prepared.

### Cooking Chart
Refer to the cooking chart to determine suitable cooking times for various food types, including meat and poultry. The chart will aid in ensuring food is cooked properly.

### Timer and Countdown Features
To set the timer, adjust the dial to the desired time. When the timer reaches zero, the appliance will turn off. It is important to regularly check that the timer is functioning correctly and set appropriately for the cooking task.

### Safety Precautions
Always ensure the appliance is switched off when not in use. Follow all safety guidelines to prevent accidents and ensure effective operation.

**Countdown Timer Instructions**

At the start, activate the countdown timer by pressing the switch. When the timer sounds, turn off any cooking functions. Before you begin, ensure you correctly follow the setup. This process is straightforward, as described below.

**Cooking Time Guidelines**

To determine the cooking time for food, refer to the provided chart, which indicates suitable hours based on the type of food. After cooking, remember to turn off the timer. Once food is cooked, allow it to cool before consumption, ensuring it is covered to maintain safety. Perishable foods should be fresh, ideally sourced directly from the market.

**Food Types and Cooking Techniques**

Be mindful of cooking times for various foods; for instance, meats should be fully cooked, reaching an internal temperature of at least 75°C. When preparing soups, bring them to a boil before reducing the heat. Thawing should be completed thoroughly, and consider using cornflour to avoid curdling in thickening processes. 

Reheat food only once to ensure safety, and do so in accordance with recommended methods, such as on the hotplate or in the microwave. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Ensure the hotplate is clean, as spills can cause fire hazards. Use appropriate cleaning agents; avoid harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces. Regular cleaning of surfaces and maintaining equipment will prolong its lifespan. 

If you need to clean the hotplate’s surface or other components, ensure the unit is off and cool. Use a soft cloth and suitable cleaners avoiding abrasive materials. 

**Handling Repairs and Safety**

For any servicing or repair needs, it is recommended to consult a qualified technician to ensure safety and adherence to regulations. The equipment should always be properly earthed and connected in line with the manufacturer's recommendations to prevent electrical shock hazards.

**Positioning and Safety Precautions**

Ensure that food is positioned safely on the shelves; this minimizes the risk of fire hazards from enclosing flammable items near the hotplate. Follow all specifications regarding spacing and placement of items to ensure effective heat distribution.

**In Summary**

Follow these instructions carefully for a successful cooking experience and to maintain your equipment effectively. Always prioritize safety and follow food handling guidelines. Regular checks and maintenance will ensure optimal functioning of your appliance.
