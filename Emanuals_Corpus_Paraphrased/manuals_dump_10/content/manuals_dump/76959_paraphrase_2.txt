### Isolation and Power Supply Guidelines

**Isolation Requirements:** 
Achieving effective isolation is crucial for the power supply. It is highly advised that the Protective Earth (PE) connection should not be linked to the Isolated DC Supply. The PE must remain separate from the non-isolated DC supply to maintain safety standards.

**AC Connection Notes:** 
The AC power supply is to be connected directly, and the PE must not connect to the power supply's neutral. This poses a significant risk if the PE is connected to a ground reference for a non-isolated DC supply. 

**Shielding Recommendations for DC Supplies:**
To enhance immunity, it is advised to utilize twisted and shielded cables for DC connections. The shield must be grounded at one end to promote effective noise reduction, with one side connected to the PE to maintain electrical integrity. Use M6 washers and screws for securing connections, employing M5 fittings for the PE.

**Optional Functionality:**
For systems requiring backup power during outages, ensure that the VDC supply is connected only to the designated terminals. This includes connections for data communication as outlined (CAN with DC connections). The shield should also be isolated appropriately from ground to prevent interference.

**Feedback and Communication Protocols:**
Feedback connections must adhere to specified wiring guidelines to ensure accurate operation of the tachometer and communication systems. Use recommended gauges for twisted-pair shielded cables, ensuring that connections are secure both electrically and mechanically.

**Tachometer Connections:**
For optimal performance of the interpolated tachometer, connections must be made as detailed in the schematic. The input and output assignments should be strictly followed to avoid errors in communication between components. 

**Assembly Guidelines:**
When assembling, ensure all feedback and communication wiring is connected according to the provided specifications. Pay attention to grounding requirements and the integrity of the shield connections to maintain performance.

**Functionality Overview:**
Multiple feedback functionalities can be employed, contingent on the application specifics, including configurations for emulated positions or commands that may influence operational characteristics. 

**Final Assembly Instructions:**
Throughout the installation process, ensure that all components are secured and organized per the outlined instructions. This guarantees not only optimal performance but also adherence to safety standards as defined in the specifications.
