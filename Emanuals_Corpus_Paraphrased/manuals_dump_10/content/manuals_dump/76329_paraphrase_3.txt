**EWT and Prewash Settings for MAX Washing Machine**

Please carefully follow the guidelines for using the EWT system and the prewash feature on your MAX washing machine. It’s essential to ensure that brooches, screws, and other similar items are securely fastened, as failure to do so may result in damage. If items are finished or torn, they should be unpacked immediately to prevent obstruction to the appliance.

Ensure the installation is performed correctly. If you encounter any issues during installation, consult the relevant sections or contact a qualified plumber if necessary. For compliance with safety standards, all connections to the water supply must follow the provided instructions.

In cold temperatures below 0°C, special measures must be taken to prevent frost damage to hoses. If you need to stop the supply, turn off the hose correctly. Ensure that the right items are used in accordance with the operational instructions. Children must be supervised to ensure their safety when using the appliance, especially at temperatures up to 90°C.

To operate the washing machine effectively:
- Make sure the locking mechanism is engaged when closing the door.
- Proportion the amounts for the prewash option effectively.
- Monitor the selection lights; if they flash, it indicates a need for attention.
- Use designated cycle options for different fabric types—Synthetics, Wool, and Delicates—to optimize washing performance.

You may choose the prewash option at 30°C, which is effective for heavily soiled items, or select higher temperature settings as needed. This option is particularly beneficial for users in colder areas. Pay attention to the operation lights and select options based on the type of load and desired results.

For any malfunctions, refer to the troubleshooting sections in the manual or get in touch with customer service. If you experience inadequate washing results, it could be due to improper loading or hose obstructions. Ensure that the hose is correctly connected and check for issues with the water supply.
