This device allows for three cooking methods: combined cooking, microwave, and defrosting. To initiate, press the Microwave button and set the desired power level. The microwave offers a range of power settings: 600W, 450W, 300W, and Combination mode. To preheat or utilize the microwave functions, the user should refer to the Selection Chart available in the manual. 

For defrosting, choose the appropriate option based on the food type, and press the relevant button to select portions. The user should monitor the food, allowing adequate time for defrosting based on the chart’s guidelines. All defrosting should be conducted using the 180W setting for optimal results.

To reheat prepared meals, press the Reheat button and follow the instructions based on the type of meal—Chilled Ready Meals or Fresh foods. It is important to ensure the food is covered properly during this process to prevent splatter.

When using the microwave, it’s essential to avoid catching food or causing spills, as this could necessitate additional cleaning. Always use microwave-safe materials; for instance, cover dishes with vented lids or microwave-safe wraps, and avoid using metal or materials not suitable for microwave use.

For maintenance, users must regularly clean the microwave's interior and surfaces to maintain efficiency. Abrasive cleaners or sharp utensils should never be used to remove deposits from any microwave surface. Any required repairs should only be performed by an authorized service technician after disconnecting the device from power.

This unit includes a warranty for the first purchaser covering periods defined in the manual. This warranty protects against defects in materials and workmanship but excludes unauthorized modifications or improper installations.
