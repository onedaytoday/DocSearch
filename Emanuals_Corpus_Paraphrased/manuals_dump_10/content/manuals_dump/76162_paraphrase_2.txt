### Installing the Cooker Hood

**Mounting the Cooker Hood:** Position the cooker hood against the wall or at a height aligned with the specified range, ensuring it is securely placed as shown in the diagrams. Refer to the provided height dimensions (X) for accuracy. During installation, utilize the supplied screws to fasten the hood at the back, ensuring it is stable.

**Optional Splashback Installation:** The splashback should be attached to both the top and bottom areas as necessary. This process is recommended for someone familiar with the installation. Start by securing the splashback to the base, then adjust its position according to the referenced dimensions and use the provided screws for fixation. If the surface is hollow, ensure you use appropriate screws designed for such materials.

**Ducted Extraction Setup:** For optimal performance, the ducting should conform to British standards or DIN 4102-B1. Connect the ducting to the top of the cooker hood as illustrated, ensuring the pathway is as direct as possible to enhance efficiency and minimize air resistance. If using the hood in a space that requires non-ducted extraction (e.g., for gases or specific heating arrangements), confirm that the filter options are suitable.

**Charcoal Filter Installation:** If using the charcoal filter, it should be fitted correctly through the designated outlets. Ensure all components are well-aligned, and secure them using the supplied screws to maintain stability. Check that the outlet connections are properly seated to avoid any leaks.
