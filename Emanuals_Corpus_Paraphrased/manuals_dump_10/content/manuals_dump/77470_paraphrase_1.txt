**IMPORTANT:** The Stop/Eject function is designed to disable recording features on the CD player. This enables you to manage recordings directly from the CD player or transfer data to a Compact Disc. To initiate this, press the Stop/Eject button, ensuring the device is facing properly. Use compatible recording media, such as CrO (Chrome) or C-60 formats, which are thinner for effective recording. 

Press the Stop/Eject button to temporarily pause or finalize recordings, allowing for efficient management of audio content. The Automatic Level Control (ALC) feature helps prevent clipping and overloading during recordings. Adjust the VOLUME as needed to optimize sound quality. The headphone jack, located at the top, allows for private listening; connecting headphones will reduce the VOLUME output to other devices.

**CARE AND MAINTENANCE:** Regular care of recorded media is essential for optimal playback. To prevent recording issues, cover the correct tabs on the media. Ensure the mechanism operates smoothly and reduce obstructions by following recommended maintenance procedures. Avoid exposing the device to direct sunlight or extreme conditions. Regularly clean the heads and exterior using a lint-free cloth or specialized head cleaner to maintain performance.

**TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE:** If you experience problems, refer to the following solutions. Ensure that you are positioned correctly for AM/FM reception and, if necessary, adjust the BAND settings for optimal signal. If sound issues persist, check that the FUNCTION switch is set to the correct mode (e.g., RADIO or CD) and inspect CD quality for scratches or damages.
