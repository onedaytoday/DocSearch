### Important Safety Information

It is essential to follow the provided instructions and ensure compliance with British CORGI standards. To prevent accidents, keep children away from the appliance, ensuring it is securely operated when in use. The cooking surface must not be touched until it has cooled down.

### Cooking Guidelines

When using the appliance, always monitor it closely. Ensure that perishable items are kept below recommended temperatures. If the appliance requires repairs or servicing, only utilize authorized service technicians. Always reference these instructions for guidance on repair and maintenance.

### Cleaning Instructions

Disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning agents that do not damage non-stick surfaces. If heavily soiled, use recommended brands designed for this purpose. Parts such as top supports and crowns are dishwasher safe; however, handle them with care to avoid scratches.

**Earth Continuity and Insulation Checks:**

1. **Earth Continuity Check (A)**: Ensure the appliance is electrically connected. The leads from the earth to earth connections should be secure and demonstrate continuity.

2. **Insulation Check (B)**: Disconnect the appliance from electricity and switch it ON. Measure insulation resistance between the leads. A reading of infinity indicates proper insulation. If the reading is low, further investigation is required to prevent issues such as burning or arcing.

3. **Electrical Supply and Testing (C, D, E)**: Verify that the electricity supply is functioning correctly. Inspect polarity and ensure the connections are tight. Manually check the light indicators for signal integrity. 

4. **Commissioning Procedure**: Start by setting the controls to maximum and minimum. Observe the readings as you adjust from minimum to maximum. If lights go out during adjustments, follow the designated procedure for troubleshooting, adjusting the main screw with a thin screwdriver while monitoring indicators.

5. **Gas Conversion and Adjustment**: For converting to LPG, ensure the device is properly connected, and turn off the electricity supply before adjusting the LPG injectors. To adjust the gas rate, locate the adjustment screw on the rating plate and use a thin screwdriver to turn it. 

**Important Note**: Always check the system after making adjustments to ensure safety and operational effectiveness.
