Follow the instructions regarding additives, ensuring that the specified amounts are adhered to. Refer directly to the guidelines for load capacities, which should not exceed one-third of the recommended amounts. Confirm that instructions for loading are followed precisely to prevent issues. Pay special attention to the loading requirements for synthetic items, as improper handling can lead to material damage or fire hazards. 

Consider the drying parameters based on the type of fabric, following settings for either normal or reduced drying times, as indicated in the chart. Ensure that items, such as towels, are sufficiently cleaned and dried without excess creasing. 

Use the START/PAUSE button to initiate cycles, observing the countdown on the display. If a malfunction occurs, such as an E40 error, reset the system according to the guidelines provided. Various options for spin speed, rinse hold, and additional rinsing functions can be selected based on the type of fabric being washed. 

When using the drying function, itâ€™s crucial to select appropriate settings for different fabric types, following recommendations for drying times and maximum loads. Always switch off the machine when not in use.

For cleaning maintenance, periodically inspect hoses for clogs and debris. If needed, disconnect hoses for cleaning and ensure they are securely reconnected. Regularly test emergency drainage protocols to prevent overflow issues, particularly in low-temperature scenarios.

In troubleshooting situations, adhere to the specified corrective measures for error codes such as E10 for water supply issues or E20 for drainage problems. Ensure the machine is connected properly, and the instructions are followed accurately to ensure optimal operation.
