### Hose Installation and Maintenance Instructions

Ensure the supplied hose is properly connected. If you're using an inflow hose, attach it securely to the AEG Service Force hose and follow the specified guidelines. Tighten the hose using the screw thread, ensuring it is straight and easily accessed for proper operation.

**Water Drainage Instructions**

Install the drainage hose as directed. Ensure that its internal structure is intact, and that it is positioned correctly—ideally, it should be upright, extending from the top of the unit to avoid kinks or blockages. For optimal performance, the height from the bottom of the container to the top of the hose must be maintained.

Every installation must comply with the dimensions and requirements specified by AEG Service Force. If any issues arise related to hose drainage or performance, refer to the provided guidance.
