The device operates continuously and has a thermostatic function. Proper installation of products is crucial; they should not be placed too closely or loosely. Make sure items are wrapped securely. If food is improperly stored or connected to the thermostat, it can lead to inefficiencies. Maintaining cleanliness of the thermostat and ensuring it is set at higher temperatures helps in managing the products more effectively and improves overall hygiene.

Ensure proper cooling and lighting operations. Refer to the user manual for specific installation guidelines, particularly regarding the distance required from walls or other furnishings. For optimal functioning, leave adequate space around the appliance, particularly in the corners, to facilitate airflow and heat dissipation.

In terms of electrical safety, ensure the appliance is earthed and connections comply with local regulations, using correctly colored wires: Brown for live (L), Blue for neutral (N), and Green/Yellow for earth (E). Any wiring issues should be addressed by a qualified technician to prevent safety hazards.

Regarding food storage, items such as fresh meats and cooked foods must be covered and stored in airtight containers. Different types of food have various recommended storage durations based on gut temperature guidelines. For instance, fresh foods should maintain storage temperatures between +7°C and -18°C.
