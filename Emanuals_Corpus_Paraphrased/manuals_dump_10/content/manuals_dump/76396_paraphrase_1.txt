To select the **SUPER QUICK** option, choose this setting to minimize wash time. The **EXTRA RINSE** function is designed for individuals needing additional rinsing. If this option is activated, an indicator light will be displayed. The light signals that the selected option is in effect and will remain illuminated under specific conditions.

If an incorrect option is chosen, a yellow indicator will illuminate for several seconds. For **DELAY START**, you can program the machine to initiate after a designated number of hours, with the display cycling through the set times. 

To start the wash cycle, press the **START/PAUSE** button. The light for the chosen option will illuminate, while the **DOOR** indicator indicates whether the door is locked. If the countdown is disrupted, you can resume the cycle as necessary.

If the **DOOR** is locked while the machine is heating or if a temperature is too high, it cannot be opened until operations comply with safety protocols. To pause the cycle, utilize the **PAUSE** button. In case of a need to abort, the corresponding indicator will activate.

When it comes to **DRYING**, the recommended method is suitable for various fabrics, including synthetics. Connect the drying hose accordingly. You can select different drying modes, such as **DRYING**, **ANTI-CREASE**, or specify fabric types like **Synthetic** or **Cotton**.

The **DRYING** setting will reflect the selected option, providing visual cues as the process progresses. Every time you adjust the drying time, the seconds will be displayed. You may press the **DRYING** button to increase drying time as needed.

During the drying phase, the machine will redistribute fabrics to prevent creasing. In the **ANTI-CREASE** phase, special sounds indicate the operation status. Should the **DOOR** need to be unlocked during this phase, ensure the machine is not busy or locked.

For a range of wash programs, options like **WASHING PROGRAMS** cater to various fabric types, such as whites, coloreds, and synthetics. Ensure proper sorting of laundry for optimal cleanliness—whites, colors, and synthetics should be separated accordingly.

When handling stubborn stains, pre-treat them with appropriate methods and drying times to maximize effectiveness. Follow the manufacturer’s guidance for suitable temperatures and settings, especially for light and dark fabrics.

Lastly, ensure to operate the drying machine with the correct settings to maintain fabric integrity while achieving optimal drying results.
