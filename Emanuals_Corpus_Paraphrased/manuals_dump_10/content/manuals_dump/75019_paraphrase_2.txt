Proper grounding minimizes electrical shock risk. The microwave must be connected to an AC power supply that complies with local codes. Consult a qualified technician if you have grounding concerns.

**Cooking Guidelines**  
Refer to the included cookbook for tips on microwave cooking. Always cover food items as necessary, and rearrange them if required for even heating. Monitor cooking times closely to prevent overcooking.

Ensure food reaches appropriate temperatures: 160°F for ground meats, 165°F for reheated items, and 180°F for poultry. Use a meat thermometer to verify. Handle hot containers with care to avoid burns.
