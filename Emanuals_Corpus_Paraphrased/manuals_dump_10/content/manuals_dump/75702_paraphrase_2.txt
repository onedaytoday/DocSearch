### Technical Overview of Chilling Process

**Model: 20GN1/1**  
The 20GN1/1 is designed to chill cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly reducing bacterial growth. Chillers effectively lower food temperature from +90°C to +3°C, maintaining optimal conditions up to -18°C without compromising food quality. The chilling modes include Soft Chilling at +2°C and standard chilling at +20°C. Each cooling phase ensures compliance with NF and UK regulations.

Built-in UV light (as an optional accessory) enhances sanitation, while the digital display provides countdown timers and service information. Performance data, including compliance with HACCP standards, is recorded, especially important if an operation unexpectedly terminates. The process efficiently chills food within four hours, adhering to NF regulatory guidelines.

**Construction Features**  
The unit features high-density polyurethane insulation, is CFC, HFC, and HCFC-free (utilizing Cyclopentane), and complies with ISO standards. The design includes rounded corners for ease of cleaning, as well as protective elements.
