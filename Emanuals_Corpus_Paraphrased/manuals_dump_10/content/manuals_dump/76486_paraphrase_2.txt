Sure! Here’s the paraphrased version of the provided text:

To maintain the washer, follow these cleaning instructions. After each use, wipe the top and front with a cloth to prevent build-up. Disconnect the hoses and use appropriate cleaning agents. For stains, apply bleach or a suitable cleaner carefully. Clean the washer’s interior and the front once a month. Start by cleaning the right side, then the back, followed by the cavity to remove any bleach residue. Avoid washing items with too much detergent or fabric softener, as this could create foam and affect washing performance. 

For optimal operation, make sure that the hose connections are tight. If you hear unusual noises like clicking or clanking, it may indicate an overload or misalignment. Restart the washer after adjusting the load. If water collects improperly or drains slowly, check the supply hoses and ensure they are correctly positioned and not clogged. 

Be aware of warranty terms: it covers workmanship defects but not issues arising from misuse or improper service.
