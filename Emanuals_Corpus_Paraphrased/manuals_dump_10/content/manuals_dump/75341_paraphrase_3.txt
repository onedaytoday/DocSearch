### DEFROST FEATURE USES

The defrost function is designed for thawing foods covered in frost or icings, such as cheesecakes, as well as for defrosting meat. 

**SELECTING DEFROST**  
To activate the defrost feature, turn the dial to the defrost setting. The internal light will indicate that the function is in operation.  

**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS**  
When defrosting, it's critical to prevent bacterial growth; follow guidelines specific to the type of food being thawed. Thinner cuts of meat, such as minced meat or thin chops, typically require less time to defrost, ranging from a few hours to ready-to-cook status. Ensure that all meat and poultry are completely thawed before cooking, and it is advisable to cook them immediately after thawing. 

**HINTS AND TIPS**  
It’s important to monitor the defrosting process, as the rate can be affected by surrounding temperatures. Avoid refreezing defrosted food unless it has been cooked, and do not leave thawed food unattended for extended periods.

**PRE-CLEANING**  
Before starting any cleaning, allow the cooling fan to cool down the appliance, and ensure it is disconnected from the electricity supply.

Use only recommended cleaning products; avoid those containing bleach, which can damage the finishes. When cleaning the exterior, refrain from using abrasive materials or scouring pads that could scratch or damage painted surfaces. 

**CLEANING CONTROL KNOBS AND HANDLES**  
Use a soft cloth for cleaning and avoid any materials that could dull the surface finish. Do not attempt to remove control knobs, as this can lead to damage and safety hazards.

**CLEANING OVEN COMPARTMENTS**  
For the top oven, switch off and disconnect from electricity before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaners as per the instructions, and be gentle around screws to avoid damage.
