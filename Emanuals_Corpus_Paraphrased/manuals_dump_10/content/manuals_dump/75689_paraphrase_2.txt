**Chiller Overview:**

The chiller is designed to cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively reducing bacterial growth. It can maintain food at -18°C within a four-hour window, ensuring safe storage and extending shelf life. The chilling and freezing mechanism is enhanced with technology that provides comprehensive performance capabilities.

**Operating Modes:**
The chiller features various operational modes, including Soft Chilling (to 2°C) and standard Chilling (to 20°C), which continuously monitor the cooling process during food insertion. It complies with NF and UK regulations and includes a built-in UV light (as an optional accessory), defrosting capabilities, and displays for countdowns and service information. Recording functionality is in place to maintain HACCP compliance and track any abnormalities during operation.
