The system comprises coolers operating at temperatures between -2°C to +8°C, featuring varying thicknesses and options for built-in or external components. This package includes pre-charged cooling units, complete with construction knowledge necessary for installation. New injection technology enhances performance and quality, while the units are insulated with pre-painted polyurethane. They are free from CFC and HCFC. The design features rounded internal corners and a fast-fit mechanism for easy and airtight installation using PVC. These systems can operate effectively in high temperatures (up to +43°C) and are compatible with refrigerants like R404A, facilitating high/low temperature management.

Defrosting is achieved through heated coils that minimize downtime, and the units have internal lighting rated at IP54. Key components include an ON/OFF switch, a lighting switch, a functional thermostat, and right-hinged doors that utilize smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges. The airtight construction and high insulation properties help reduce energy consumption while ensuring compliance with HACCP standards.
