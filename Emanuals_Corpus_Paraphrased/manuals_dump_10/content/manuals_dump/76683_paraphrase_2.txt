### Elite Screens User Guide

**Warning:** Ensure that the screen is kept away from any potential fire hazards, including BBQ grills or heaters. The top edge of the screen should be positioned safely above any sources of heat or flame.

To protect the screen from fire risks such as BBQs, heaters, or fireworks, it's important to keep a safe distance. Before securing the screen, unclip both sides of the cover. Once the cover is removed, check the height of the screen and adjust as necessary.

When operating the screen, press the control button to retract the screen into its housing. Make sure both ends of the housing are securely closed. Adjust the angle of the screen slightly for optimal viewing.

For best sound performance, it is recommended to store the screen in a safe place, such as a closet. Avoid exposing it to moisture, and clean it gently with a soft cloth to prevent any damage.
