Certainly! Here’s a technical paraphrase of the text while maintaining its meaning:

To clean the CLEAN WASHER and eliminate any mold or buildup, adhere to the following cleaning procedures. Select the CLEAN WASHER cycle from the specialty section of the washer. Inspect the machine for cleanliness. The effectiveness of your cleaning depends on the severity of the buildup. It is important to prevent damage to clothing from bleach. If using bleach or a bleach cleaner, select TIDE WASHING MACHINE CLEANER for effective results. After initiating the CLEAN WASHER cycle, immediately follow with a rinse using either bleach or the CLEAN WASHER setting. Note that harsh reactions may occur if bleach is mixed with other household chemicals.

Upon completing the cleaning routine, wipe down the top and interior of the washer with a cloth. Turn off the water supply to avoid build-up in the hoses. If staining occurs, use bleach to treat discolored areas. Always refer to the important instructions: disconnect the water hoses thoroughly and ensure the washer is properly grounded. 

For winterization of RVs, refer to the WINTERIZING INSTRUCTIONS provided, ensuring that appliances remain upright and follow the specific precautions indicated. 

Common issues, possible causes, and solutions include:
- **Greasy Residue:** Use undiluted bleach directly on affected areas. 
- **Static in Fabrics:** Increase water temperature and ensure proper detergent usage for clean cycles. 
- **Low Water Temperature:** Verify the heater is functional and adjust as necessary.

Rewashing may be required in cases of improper detergent amounts or if fabric types are mismatched. 

Service may be needed if unusual noises arise, such as high-pitched whines or thumps indicating improper loading. Ensure the washer is installed tightly and not overloaded. 

For water issues, check for clogs in hoses, ensure they are connected correctly, and measure water temperature, which should be at least 120°F (49°C).
