### Important Safety Information

When unpacking the washer, be mindful of potential suffocation hazards, especially for children. Ensure that the washer is unpacked and free of coverings that could create airtight chambers. 

**Warning:** Improper handling can result in serious injury or death.
  
**Caution:** Be aware of excessive weight hazards. Itâ€™s essential to keep the washer in an upright position and properly supported during installation.

### Installation Guidelines

- **Grounding:** Ensure the washer is correctly grounded to prevent electrical shock. Use a licensed professional to verify proper grounding. 
- **Power Supply:** Check that the power supply circuit is appropriately fused and matches specifications outlined by ANSI/NFPA or C22.1.
- **Water Supply:** The water supply must be within 48 inches of the washer, with suitable hose connections.

**Important:** Complete all installations as per the guidelines to ensure optimal performance.

### Unpacking

Remove the following from the washer before use:

- Shipping fork
- Clamps
- Spacers
- Bolts
- Universal wrench (included)
- Hole plugs (in bag)

### Connecting Water Supply

- Ensure rubber washers are present in hoses.
- Connect the hot water hose (red) to the hot supply and the cold water hose (blue) to the cold supply.
  
Make sure to tighten each connection securely and check for leaks.

### Operating the Washer

Upon initial use, run an empty cycle to verify functionality. During this operation, monitor for messages like "NO WATER CHECK HOSES" or "CALL SERVICE" for any necessary adjustments.

### Important Reminders

- Protect the washer during transport with cloth or towel.
- Remove screws carefully to avoid damage or electric shock risks.
  
Follow instructions closely for removing and reattaching parts to maintain proper functioning.

For further queries or technical information, refer to the documentation included with the washer.

To reattach the assembly, use the course-thread, counter-sunk screws to ensure proper alignment with the latch mechanism. Align the cover from the right side and secure it to the cover plate. Rotate the screws clockwise to tighten them properly.
