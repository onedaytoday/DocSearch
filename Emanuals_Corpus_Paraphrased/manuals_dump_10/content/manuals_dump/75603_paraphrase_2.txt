**Chillers GN Overview**

The GN Chillers are designed for rapidly cooling cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, which helps to minimize bacterial growth. The chilling process efficiently brings food down to the required holding temperature of +3°C while maintaining food safety without compromising quality.

**Operating Modes**

The chillers feature various operating modes, including Soft Chilling (down to +2°C) and standard Chilling (down to +20°C), to accommodate different food types. The system is engineered to continuously maintain temperature and includes built-in defrosting capabilities. It offers a countdown display and service information regarding different settings and statuses (P1, P2), including HACCP compliance status, even in cases of abnormal termination.

**Performance and Compliance**

The performance is optimized for rapid cooling from +90°C to +3°C, adhering to NF* regulations for food safety.

**Construction and Design**
