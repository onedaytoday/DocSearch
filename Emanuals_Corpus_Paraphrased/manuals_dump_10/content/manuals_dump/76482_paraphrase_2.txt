### Ice and Water Dispenser Maintenance Guide

**Cleaning the Ice Dispenser**: 
To maintain the ice dispenser, ensure it is turned off and completely empty before cleaning with clear water or approved cleaners. Proper sanitation is crucial, so make sure the unit is thoroughly cleaned before resuming operation. 

**Installation Notes**: 
For models purchased with TM Ice and Water, refer to the following guidelines. The water supply should be turned off during certain processes, and installation may require assistance from Consumer Support or visiting www.frigidaire.com for additional information.
