**Safety Warnings and Precautions**

Throughout these instructions, various warning labels indicate hazards related to installation and operation. A "DANGER" warning signifies a risk of death or serious injury. A "WARNING" indicates potentially grave harm, while a "CAUTION" suggests a risk of injury. It is crucial to adhere to the guidelines to prevent accidents or damages. Children should be kept clear of the product, especially when unpacking or using protective sheets, as these can create suffocation hazards.

**Installation Considerations**

Ensure the appliance is properly installed in accordance with local codes, and that it is connected to a grounded outlet with a three-prong plug to prevent electrical shock. Avoid placing the unit in direct sunlight or near heat sources. Recommended installation temperatures are between 40°F (4°C) and 110°F (43°C). Allow sufficient clearance around the unit for proper ventilation and for the ease of installation.

**Mounting Instructions**

When mounting, use an appropriate wrench to tighten screws securely. Ensure that the appliance is level and stable to function correctly. If not installed properly, it may lead to poor cooling performance or other operational issues. Match the mounting height and spacing according to instructional guidelines.

**Operational Guidelines**

Before turning on the appliance, let it cool for four hours. The Custom electronic controls allow you to adjust temperatures effectively, enabling settings from 33°F (1°C) to 46°F (8°C). Familiarize yourself with the control panel, including functions like the air filter replacement indicator and temperature alarms.

**Maintenance Reminders**

Regular maintenance involves checking the air filter every few months and replacing it as needed. The appliance features automatic alerts for performance and safety, including door ajar warnings and temperature alerts. 

For detailed service or warranty inquiries, please contact Electrolux or refer to the support cover located on the front of the unit.

### Food Management Tips

To maintain optimal food quality, avoid overcrowding shelves in the refrigerator, as this can hinder airflow and cooling efficiency. Keep meat and other perishable items securely contained, shielded from direct sunlight and sources of heat, such as radiant appliances or dishwashers. Ensure cabinetry insulation is effective to maintain appropriate temperatures.

To reduce frost build-up and optimize cooling performance, do not overload the refrigerator. If you plan to be away for more than three months, clean and unplug the unit, and properly secure food items. Use scouring brushes or recommended cleaners to eliminate any residue. Always clean surfaces immediately to prevent build-up.

### Care and Cleaning Instructions

When cleaning, use a soft cloth to wipe interior and exterior surfaces, avoiding abrasive materials or harsh solvents. For routine maintenance, refer to the Care and Cleaning Chart, and utilize non-abrasive household cleaners for smooth surfaces. 

### Warranty and Troubleshooting Guidance

For warranty service, ensure any issues related to workmanship are addressed promptly. Common problems may include unusual sounds or error codes displayed (E7, E8, E9). In case of a malfunction, inspect the power source, check for blown fuses, and ensure proper door closure. If you hear cracking or popping sounds, these may occur while the appliance cools. Please allow several hours for the refrigerator to stabilize at the selected temperature.
