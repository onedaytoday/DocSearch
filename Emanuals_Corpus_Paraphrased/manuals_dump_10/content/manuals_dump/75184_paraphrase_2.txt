### Preheating Instructions

**Preheating Overview**  
Before using the oven, preheating is essential for optimal cooking results. The temperature range for preheating is between 170°F to 550°F (77°C to 288°C). 

**Setting the Temperature**  
To preheat to 350°F, adjust the racks as needed. Press the appropriate buttons; if "UPPER" and "BAKE" are displayed, confirm by selecting these options. A flashing "PRE" indicates the preheating process is active. Once the oven reaches 350°F, an audible signal will notify you that it's time to place the food inside.

**High-Temperature Preheating**  
If you need to preheat to 425°F, follow the same procedure. The display will show "UPPER" and "BAKE," which will flash until the desired temperature is reached. You’ll hear a sound indicating that you can now add food.

### Baking Notes 

Ensure to allow sufficient space for air circulation around food items. If the oven is overcrowded, it may lead to uneven cooking. It’s recommended to allow for a temperature adjustment of 25°F/12°C higher than the specified setting, depending on the type of food being prepared.

### Convection Cooking

Using convection helps to cook food evenly and more rapidly. You may need to adjust cooking times and temperatures accordingly.  

- **Cooking Temperature Adjustments**: For convection baking, decrease the cooking time, as heat circulates uniformly around food, particularly for items like bread. 

- **Preheating with Convection**: Similar to regular baking, preheat the oven to 350°F. Use the "UPPER," "BAKE," and "CONV" settings to initiate preheating. You will receive an audible signal when the desired temperature is achieved.

### Roasting Instructions

When roasting, ensure that the heat is evenly distributed around the food. Use a proper roasting pan to catch grease and facilitate effective cooking. Avoid overcrowding to maintain optimal airflow.

### Additional Tips

- Keep racks clean and well-positioned for effective heat circulation.
- Do not open the oven door frequently, as this can alter cooking times and temperatures.
- Adjust cooking times based on specific food types tested for convection cooking efficiency.

By following these instructions meticulously, you can achieve the best results while cooking and baking in your oven.

### Convection Conversion Feature Settings

To effectively use the Convection Convert feature, it is essential to select the proper settings when using the Convection Convert CF with food that requires conversion (e.g., cooking temperature adjustments). The feature is designed to signal when the food is nearing completion, usually with an audible alert. The cooking is only considered complete when the necessary internal temperature is reached, and the sound indicator activates.

To set the Convection Convert to 350°F, press the appropriate buttons for "UPPER" and "BAKE." If other indicators like "CONV" or "UPPER" appear without the corresponding options, check that the desired temperature has been set correctly. For instance, if the sound plays upon reaching the target temperature, ensure that the cooking time closely aligns with recommended guidelines, particularly for meats.

### Delayed Bake or Delayed Convection Bake Settings

When utilizing the Delayed Bake or Delayed Convection Bake features, ensure to account for safe food handling practices. If the clock is set for more than a few hours, the system will remind you to check the food periodically. This function is perfect for items like meats, which should be taken out promptly once cooking has finished. Always keep food safety in mind to prevent foodborne illnesses.

### Timed Bake or Timed Convection Bake Settings

For the Timed Bake or Timed Convection Bake options, you will need to set the amount of cooking time desired. The system will automatically turn off once the time is complete. To activate, select "UPPER" and "BAKE" until the indicators appear. Users can confirm that the timer is engaged by checking for flashing lights on the display. Once the cooking cycle is complete and the sound signals, you can safely remove your food.

### Broiling Instructions

During broiling, preheat the oven to your desired temperature, typically between 400°F and 550°F. This stage helps sear the food effectively. Ensure to monitor closely as high heat can cause grease to smoke. Following a reliable recipe will guide you in cooking and safety precautions. 

### Sabbath Feature

The Sabbath feature is specifically designed to be used during Jewish holidays, adhering to strict guidelines. Refer to the manual to fully understand its functionality.

### Utilizing the Self-Cleaning Feature

Before using the self-clean feature, allow the oven to cool down. Always wear protective gear when operating the self-cleaning function. Ensure to avoid using harsh chemicals around the self-cleaning area. Only clean items that are rated for high temperatures; otherwise, they might get damaged.

### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle

To begin the self-cleaning process, ensure that the oven has cooled down. This cycle may take several hours, depending on the selected intensity of cleaning. Once initiated, the locking mechanism will engage, indicating that it is unsafe to open the oven during cleaning. Always remove racks before starting the cleaning cycle, as indicated by the system prompts. 

Overall, proper operation and adherence to safety protocols will ensure effective use of the oven’s features while maintaining food quality and safety.

### Cleaning Instructions

**Upper Door and Racks**  
To clean the upper door and racks safely, ensure the oven is in the self-clean or locked mode. When the "DOOR" and "LOCKED" indicators are flashing, allow approximately 30 seconds for the system to initiate. If needed, you can start the optional Self-Clean function immediately after the upper settings are indicated. 

**General Cleaning**  
For routine maintenance, turn off the oven and allow it to cool. Promptly clean any spills and heavy residue to minimize the need for extensive cleaning later. Regular cleaning helps reduce maintenance frequency. Use a soft cloth to clean painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces. Always apply cleaners to the cloth rather than directly on surfaces to prevent damage. Avoid abrasive materials that could scratch finishes. 

**Special Care for Stainless Steel**  
Refer to the cleaning section for optimum care of stainless steel surfaces to maintain their appearance.

**Removing and Replacing the Oven Door**  
Follow the specific instructions to detach the oven door safely. For hidden bake element cover removal, lift the rear of the cover with your hand while gently unscrewing the fasteners. Ensure proper handling and reinstallation to avoid damages.

**Oven Light Instructions**  
Ensure all safety precautions are taken when cleaning the oven light shield. The shield must always be in place during operation for safety. Be cautious when handling these components, especially when the oven is cool.

**Usage and Functionality Issues**  
If the oven does not operate or if the control panel beeps and displays an error code, utilize the CANCEL function to reset. If persistent issues occur, consult an authorized servicer. Check for blown fuses or tripped switches in the electrical supply. 

**Cleaning Residual Odors**  
If food residues remain after the self-cleaning cycle, additional manual cleaning may be required.
