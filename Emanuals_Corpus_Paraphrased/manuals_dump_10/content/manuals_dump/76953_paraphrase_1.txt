**Camera Configuration for Alarm In/Out**

Select the menu options such as BLC, AGC, AP, and GAIN. Navigate through pages using NEXT and select MEMORY CLEAR, WB settings, and adjust white balance by using the SHIFT options to access previous settings. The BACK LIGHT function coordinates with the AGC for lighting and background correction.

Home settings can be restored to factory defaults using the HOME button, which adjusts white balance based on ambient lighting conditions. The system supports various white balance settings including 3,200K, 4,200K, and 6,300K with adjustments for color corrections. You can switch between ATW and AWC modes as well as indoor and outdoor settings.

For motor settings, adjust the PAN and TILT speeds, and select the desired operation mode (AUTO or MANUAL). This includes character adjustments for title displays, which utilize alphabetic and numerical inputs.

**Alarm Input/Output and Termination**

The ALARM IN/OUT terminals can be short-circuited to the GND as needed. When inputs are activated, appropriate outputs will be triggered based on settings configured in the OSD.

The ALL CLEAR function resets the camera motor settings and restores the OSD to its factory state by toggling the DIP switch. The RS-485 interface connects the camera to a PC, allowing settings for data transmission using DIP switches for ID addressing.

**ID Addressing and Termination Resistance**

The ID settings and termination resistance are managed through DIP switches on the unit. Ensure that termination is enabled for the RS-485 connection and configure the ID according to the specified guidelines as outlined in the unit's documentation. Each state (ON/OFF) of the DIP switches should be adhered to for proper communication and function.

These configurations ensure smooth integration and operation of the camera's features, compatible with your system's requirements.
