The refrigeration units operate within a temperature range of -2 to +8°C and feature a robust construction with varying thicknesses. They are equipped with pre-charged cooling systems and designed for efficient assembly, supported by knowledge of advanced injection techniques that enhance performance and insulation. These units are free from CFCs and HCFCs, featuring rounded internal corners to improve airflow. Their fast-fit design allows for easy installation, ensuring airtight connections with PVC and additional components, capable of functioning smoothly in high ambient temperatures up to +43°C using refrigerant R404A.

The defrost system utilizes heated components to minimize frost buildup and includes IP54-rated internal lighting. Key features comprise an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, operational indicators, and an adjustable thermostat. The right-hinged door employs smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring an airtight seal and superior insulation to enhance operational efficiency. This design has been developed in compliance with HACCP standards.

Accessories available include various aluminum shelves for cold rooms, a door microswitch, graphic temperature recording kits, advanced cold room connections, a plastic curtain for 65 cm door clearances, and HACCP-compatible printers for temperature logging. The technical data encompasses dimensions, voltage, and phase specifications for models ranging from CR16F067R to CR24F080R.
