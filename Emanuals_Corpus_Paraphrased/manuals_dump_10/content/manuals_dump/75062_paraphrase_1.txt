**Microwave Cooking Instructions**

To initiate the cooking process, press the START/QUICK button. Cooking time will be displayed once the timer/weight setting is adjusted. To alter the cooking duration or weight, rotate the TIMER/WEIGHT dial either clockwise or counterclockwise. The START/QUICK button also allows for direct cooking at high power for set intervals. You can monitor the cooking time displayed while the microwave operates. The AUTO COOK and AUTO DEFROST functions enable quick selections for various food items.

For specific adjustments during cooking, use the PLUS and MINUS buttons to increase or decrease the time, ensuring you select the appropriate settings for firmer or softer food consistency. If cooking using the grill function, the recommended time will adjust to prevent burning.

To grill or brown food, press the relevant button after setting the desired time with the TIMER/WEIGHT dial. The microwave's dual grill option can also be activated through the same procedure. 

The AUTO COOK and AUTO DEFROST features provide comprehensive options for various dishes. Press the AUTO COOK button and adjust the TIMER/WEIGHT setting for precise control. Throughout the process, you will hear sounds indicating cooking stages, and the display will flash accordingly.

For defrosting meat, fish, and poultry, use the AUTO DEFROST function, adjusting the TIMER/WEIGHT dial and pressing START/QUICK to begin. Ensure that items are thoroughly defrosted, rearranging them as needed.

To prepare specific recipes, refer to the provided cooking charts, which outline the necessary adjustments based on food type and weight. For example, when preparing meats, ensure they are evenly spaced for thorough cooking and reroute as required. 

Lastly, remember to season your dishes appropriately and use microwave-safe coverings throughout the cooking process to enhance flavor and retain moisture. Follow these guidelines to achieve optimal outcomes with your microwave cooking experience.

Sure! Here’s the paraphrased version in a natural, technical style:

Finely chop the onion and garlic, combine with the other ingredients, and purée. Season and cook the mixture with the selected spices. Grease the dish and layer it with a portion of the minced meat along with vegetables and herbs. Cover and cook, turning once, and allow to cool afterward. Slice lengthwise and remove the flesh, blending it with the onion until smooth. Season it and spread the mixture on top. 

In a shallow baking dish, prepare with the chopped onion and garlic, adding the grated components. Cook the pears and keep them covered until done. Drain the pears after cooking. Maintain heat while mixing milk with cornflour and cover as needed. 

When cleaning the microwave, avoid using commercial oven cleaners, abrasives, or any substances containing sodium hydroxide. Regularly clean the oven and remove food residues. Utilize a damp cloth for easier cleaning of surfaces, ensuring that no harsh scrubbing pads are used. Both the microwave and turntable should be cleaned with a cloth and can often be placed in a dishwasher as long as proper care is taken. 

Do not overload the microwave, as this may lead to overheating. For effective operation, ensure the door is properly closed and the turntable is securely in place. If the microwave fails to work, consult a qualified technician from the Service Force for assistance. 

The specifications may undergo changes for continuous improvements, and specific electrical requirements must be followed. Ensure the appliance is properly earthed, and adhere to all safety instructions related to electrical connections. 

For recycling the appliance, contact your local council or health office for proper disposal methods. For assistance with your microwave, including service or replacement parts, contact AEG-Service Force or visit their website for more information. Ensure maintenance is carried out by authorized personnel to maintain warranty conditions.
