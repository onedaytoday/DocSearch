Ensure that food is stored correctly to avoid overheating or spoilage, and always adhere to the temperature settings indicated. If the appliance fails to perform as expected, check all connections and settings, and contact customer service for guidance.

The information currently displayed relates to the operation and status of the device. The defrosting process should only occur according to the recommended methods. Once defrosting is finished, ensure the appliance is turned off to preserve its lifespan. 

Warning: Regular cleaning is necessary to avoid frost buildup, which can affect performance. Disconnect the appliance before cleaning to prevent electric shock. Use appropriate non-corrosive cleansers and do not cover the air filter. 

Cubing ice should take about 10 seconds using the supplied tools. Monitor food temperature to ensure it remains within the recommended range for optimal freshness. Be cautious with food items that require specific handling, such as tightly sealed cooked meals that could burst or create hazards if improperly handled. 

Use the TURBOCOOLMATIC feature when needed to rapidly cool fresh food to a desired temperature of +3°C. The function automatically activates and will turn off when the target temperature is reached. 

In the case of frost accumulation, ensure the defrosting settings are correctly applied, and always allow enough time for proper cooling. The appliance's indicators will inform you of the operating status, and any required actions can be taken accordingly.

To preserve food quality, maintain airtight seals and proper wrapping methods. Regular maintenance and monitoring of humidity levels will improve longevity and quality for food stored at LONGFRESH 0°C.

Here’s a more technically phrased and streamlined version of your text, keeping the original meaning intact:

Food storage recommendations for the LONGFRESH at 0°C should prioritize fresh products and meats. Items ideally placed in this environment include seafood, cooked meats, artichokes, sprouts, Chinese radishes, and peas. It's essential to ensure proper packaging of food items to maintain quality. The LONGFRESH unit allows for the preservation of foods for up to three months, provided that they are sealed correctly. 

To operate the unit effectively, ensure that items are stored in airtight containers. Turn off the LONGFRESH function using the ON/OFF switch; a countdown will initiate prior to shutdown. If the operation is interrupted, check power supply connections for safety. During cleaning, ensure that all surfaces, including the interior compartments and door seals, are maintained to prevent contamination and support optimal functionality.

For items placed in the unit, the FROSTMATIC feature can be activated to emphasize rapid cooling, subsequently maintaining a stable temperature at approximately 0°C. Monitor indicator lights to confirm the operation status—both the current and target temperatures are displayed. If adjustments are needed, use the designated buttons (J or L) to reach the desired temperature settings.

Regular defrosting and cleaning are crucial to avoid frost accumulation, which can affect performance. Should frost build-up occur, switch off the unit and allow thawing before cleaning. Use caution with high-proof products or tightly sealed containers to avoid pressure build-up, which may lead to leakage or burst containers.

In summary, to maintain optimal conditions within the LONGFRESH unit, adhere to these guidelines for food selection, packaging, and machine operation. Regular checks and maintenance will ensure the longevity of both the appliance and the freshness of its contents.
