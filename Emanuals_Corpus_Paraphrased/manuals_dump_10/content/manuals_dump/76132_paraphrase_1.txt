### INSTALLING THE COOKER HOOD

Mount the Ceiling/Support Shelf according to the shelf template. Ensure that the template aligns with the corresponding holes. Use the appropriate screws with the correct hollow thickness for securing the shelf to the ceiling. Ensure the screws are adequately placed and tightened to support the shelf effectively.

When installing the cooker hood, ensure that the screws are fully tightened to prevent any issues with stability. The mountings must be properly anchored to a structurally sound surface to withstand thrust and stress.

For ducting, itâ€™s crucial to maintain the shortest and most efficient path to ensure optimal performance. If the installation angle exceeds 90 degrees, it may impair performance, so avoid bends where possible. All components must comply with relevant fire safety standards, such as British regulations or DIN 4102-B1.

When selecting ducting, ensure it is compatible with the cooker hood and the intended heating system. For example, if heat sources are present, use a sealed duct type to prevent fire hazards. Connect the necessary heating components and ensure proper fitting of charcoal filters to manage odors effectively.

The chimney system consists of the main housing and its sections, which should be connected using the provided screws. Ensure that grease is filtered out correctly by the activated charcoal. Install the fixture with care, using the designated screws for proper function.
