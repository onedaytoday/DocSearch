This section provides vital details regarding the product's operation, allowing users to familiarize themselves with its features. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure proper usage. Avoid using screws or other components that may compromise functionality, especially if dealing with high specifications. For repairs, especially for serious issues or malfunctioning, it is essential to consult customer service. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the device and preventing issues with the supply hoses.

### Frost Considerations

When temperatures are low, refer to the relevant chapter for precautions. Ensure compliance with the washing instructions; certain items should not be machine washed or should be washed in specified conditions. Always keep cleaning products out of reach of children to prevent any safety hazards.

### Operational Features

The EWF model is equipped with ECO settings that enhance efficiency and minimize resource use. Please utilize the prewash feature according to the manual, which includes various charts for operational guidelines. 

### Temperature Settings

Adjust the temperature settings according to fabric care requirements, with options ranging from 90°C for heavily soiled items to 30°C for delicate fabrics. Use the animated thermometer for accurate settings. Select the appropriate cycle by turning the dial clockwise or anticlockwise as indicated.

### Program Selection

Select programs based on fabric type: Synthetics, Wool, Handwash, etc. Repeatedly pressing the button increases the selected wash phase. Flashing lights indicate the duration of the selected option. Be attentive; switching options incorrectly may disrupt the cycle, triggering an acoustic signal.

### Sorting Laundry

Proper sorting of laundry is crucial. Organize items into categories such as whites, colors, and delicates to maintain fabric integrity. New colored items should always be washed separately to prevent color transfer. It’s recommended to wash heavily soiled items in smaller loads to ensure thorough cleaning.

This version captures the original meaning while refining the language for clarity and technical accuracy.

Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a more technical yet natural manner:

When washing items with cloths and grease, use specific procedures for pre-treatment with bleach, applicable only for whites and colors. For effective cleaning, lightly apply bleach to affected areas and treat stains like lipstick by using appropriate bleaching techniques. Wash items following guidelines for whites, ensuring proper dilution of bleach and thorough cleaning processes.

Select wash cycles based on fabric type, with recommendations typically ranging from 30°C to 95°C, while incorporating prewash settings for heavily soiled items. Consult supply authority information for water classification. Follow all cleaning guidelines to maintain optimal performance and efficiency, particularly for synthetics and blends requiring special care.

Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply when performing maintenance, and keep it clean to avoid blockages. Check hoses for clogs, and ensure they are securely attached. If a service malfunction occurs, follow troubleshooting steps outlined in the manual, noting any error codes and their meanings.

For optimal washing results, ensure that the machine operates within specified temperature ranges and that detergent is properly measured. Refer to the user manual for specific cycles and instructions, particularly for delicate and wool items. Ensure all components, including hoses and filters, are free of obstructions to maintain efficiency during operation.

Upon unpacking, verify all parts are included, such as hoses and spacers. Position the appliance correctly to prevent interference with operation, ensuring secure connections to the water supply.

This maintains the original meaning but structures the information more clearly and technically.

The positioning of the hose must be correct to ensure proper threading. If the hose has been extended too much, it may be necessary to acquire a new, specially designed hose. This type of hose is protected against damage. If the location of the hose is shown as problematic, the water supply should be turned off and serviced immediately. The hose should be at least a specific distance above the ground, adhering to regulations regarding its height and placement.

Ensure that the single-phase supply is properly earthed. If the supply must be replaced, this task should be handled by qualified service personnel. It is essential to follow local regulations.

For recycling information and proper disposal, contact local authorities or household service providers, especially when dealing with items that need to be recycled. Items usually do not require prewashing but should be loaded correctly before being washed. 

Different countries have specific guidelines for disposal. Be aware that equipment purchased must comply with regulations in the country where it was initially acquired. Customer Service is available for additional inquiries or support, and further details can be found at www.electrolux.com or relevant regional sites.
