### Troubleshooting Your Appliance

If your appliance is malfunctioning, follow these troubleshooting steps first. Consult the troubleshooting section related to its functions and services. In some cases, professional consulting or contracting might be necessary. **WARNING: ELECTROCUTION HAZARD** â€” Never attempt to disconnect power while the unit is connected. Ensure the appliance is plugged in and check for proper operation as indicated by the LED light. If the light does not illuminate when the door is closed, verify that alarms are off. 

If service is needed, return to the place of purchase or visit www.electroluxappliances.com. Make sure the appliance is not too cold, which could indicate a freeze-up condition. If the unit is too cold, it may need to be warmed up.
