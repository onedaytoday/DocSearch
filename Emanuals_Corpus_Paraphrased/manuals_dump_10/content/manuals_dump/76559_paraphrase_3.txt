Press the MENU button, then navigate to CHANNEL. If enabled, this option prevents certain content from showing on the TV. This feature provides various settings that allow users to restrict access based on ratings, such as MPAA or TV ratings, which can be selected from the available options. Users can specify which ratings are permitted, such as TV-PG, TV-14, or TV-MA, and can choose to block or allow certain content based on criteria like violence or sexual content. 

To modify these settings, users can access the auxiliary input and disconnect the TV if necessary. It’s important to be aware of the MPAA ratings system, which categorizes content to inform viewers about age appropriateness—from PG to NC-17. Each rating specifies the suitability for children, with TV-Y suitable for younger audiences, up to TV-MA for mature content.
