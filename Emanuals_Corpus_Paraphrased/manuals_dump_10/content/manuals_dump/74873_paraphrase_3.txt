### Built-In Installation
This section covers the requirements for installing your dishwasher as a built-in appliance, ensuring that it is correctly positioned and freely accessible. 

Please follow all instructions carefully to ensure safe and optimal operation.

### Initial Start-Up Process
Upon receiving the unit, ensure the power supply is properly grounded and connected to a 115V outlet. Activate the device using the ON/OFF switch, allowing the system to run for a few seconds. Water will circulate through the assembly almost immediately, and some operational sounds may be noticeable within the first few hours. It’s essential to maintain the system's functionality and cleanliness during this initial period.

### Normal Operation
During standard operation, water will continuously flow into the assembly, allowing ice to form. Once the ice reaches a specific thickness, the assembly will shut off, and this process will repeat. Regular sounds from the machine indicate proper functioning and ice cleanliness. Variations in ice cube clarity and thickness may arise due to differences in batches or within the same batch. 

### Care for Ice Dispenser Operation
For optimal ice thickness, factory settings may need adjustment. If the cubes start becoming thicker than desired, follow the warning labels indicating the correct settings. Adjust the thickness dial as needed, turning it clockwise to thicken or counterclockwise to thin the ice cubes. Allow time for changes to take effect, ideally monitoring over a few hours.

### Special Considerations
To maintain performance, avoid exposing the unit to direct sunlight. If temperatures drop below 45°F (7°C), ensure proper coverage to avoid warranty exclusions. When temperatures exceed 110°F (43°C), it may hinder ice production. Regular cleaning is essential for longevity and efficiency.

### Cleaning Instructions
Use appropriate stainless steel cleaners and avoid abrasive materials like steel wool or non-stainless steel cleaners, which can damage surfaces. For stubborn stains, Bon-Ami or similar products can be used. High-quality cleaner/polish should be applied regularly to maintain the appearance. 

### Monthly Cleaning
Conduct cleaning every three months or as needed to ensure efficiency. When cleaning, avoid sharp components and use protective gear if necessary. Following the specific instructions and maintaining a regular cleaning schedule will help prolong the life of the unit.

### Drainage and Non-use
To prevent issues during extended non-use, disconnect from the power supply and drain any standing water. If temperatures are expected to drop below recommended levels, ensure the unit is properly drained and covered if necessary.

### Troubleshooting Tips
If the unit appears to malfunction, check the basics first, such as the power connection and surrounding areas. Ensure water supply hoses are correctly attached and free of obstructions. If consistent problems arise, contact the vendor for service, providing the necessary details like model number and related information found on the unit’s identification plate.
