If installation occurs in a frost-prone area, consult the relevant chapter for freezing precautions. Products must only be laundered per provided instructions. Ensure items are not washed with incompatible materials, and confirm that children or individuals with disabilities are kept away from potentially hazardous areas to avoid suffocation risks.

**Operating Instructions**

Before utilizing the product, it is critical to comply with all guidelines. The maximum temperature for the wash cycle is 90°C. The device may produce specific acoustic alerts depending on button selections and operational phases. Note that the audio cues can be deactivated and later reactivated.

Select the correct wash cycle based on fabric type, for instance, synthetics, wool, or delicate items. Phases such as prewash can be added depending on requirements. Adjustments can be made at any time through specific buttons, and the system will illustrate the current settings through flashing indicators.

**Sorting Guidelines for Laundry**

To optimize washing efficiency, follow these sorting guidelines: separate whites, colors, and fabrics appropriately. Always wash new colored items separately to prevent discoloration.
