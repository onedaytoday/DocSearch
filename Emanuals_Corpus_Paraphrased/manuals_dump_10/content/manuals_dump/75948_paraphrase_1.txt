### SANTO KG Operating Instructions

These operating guidelines provide essential information for the usage and maintenance of the appliance. It’s important to refer to these instructions, especially for notes regarding critical functions and alerts (Warning!). Supplementary information concerning operation and any associated sounds can be found in the relevant sections of this manual, specifically under "Technical Terminology." 

This manual addresses troubleshooting procedures in the section titled "What to Do If." Should any issues arise, contacting AEG Service Force is recommended. 

**Appliance Overview**

Ensure that the appliance is correctly positioned and that its environment supports optimal performance. Avoid exposing the appliance to direct sunlight or other heat sources. The rating plate indicates the specific conditions suited for this appliance, which includes temperature ranges from SN to C, ST, and so forth. 

**Installation and Location**

The appliance should be installed in a well-ventilated area to maintain its operational efficiency. Adequate clearances must be maintained around the appliance, particularly at the rear and top, to facilitate proper air circulation and prevent overheating. 

**Electrical Safety**

This appliance must be earthed. The electrical supply should match the rating specified on the appliance. The wiring, colored correspondingly, must be connected properly to their respective terminals—Earth (E), Neutral (N), and Live (L).

**Maintenance and Usage**

Regular cleaning is crucial. Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before maintenance. Handle any repairs through authorized service personnel to avoid risks of electric shock or fire hazards. Avoid using the appliance if it shows signs of malfunction or misoperation.

**Control Panel Functions**

The control panel includes buttons for adjusting temperatures (WARMER and COLDER) which change the Actual to Desired settings. The temperature display will indicate the current state; if neither button is pressed, the system will revert to the Actual temperature after a brief delay. 

**Alarm Settings**

In the event of a warning (ALARM OFF), the acoustic signal can be silenced by pressing the appropriate button. Monitoring temperatures is essential, especially during initial setup, to ensure the appliance operates efficiently.

For further details and safety regulations, consult the respective sections in this manual. Properly following these instructions will promote the longevity and performance of your appliance.

**COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Functions**

The COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC functions are designed to enhance the cooling process and preserve fresh food. The COOLMATIC function can be activated or deactivated independently, and an indicator light shows its status. Once activated, it will cool for a predetermined number of hours before reverting to the original settings. 

The FROSTMATIC function, on the other hand, prioritizes fresh food products and safeguards existing items in the freezer. It too can be toggled manually, and when deactivated, the corresponding light will turn off.

**Powering Off the Appliance**

To turn off the appliance, use the ON/OFF button. A countdown will be displayed; when it reaches zero, the appliance will shut down, and the indicator light will turn off. If there’s a power failure, the appliance operates normally upon reconnection unless deliberately powered off. 

For defrosting and thorough cleaning, follow the specific guidelines provided. 

**Temperature Management and Safety**

To maintain optimal cooling, use compartment thermometers for monitoring temperatures. Foods should be stored with adequate separation to prevent spoilage and retain freshness. Regular checks are advised, especially after stocking new items or rearranging. 

**Fresh Food Storage Guidelines**

For effective storage, items should be positioned correctly based on their specific needs. Ensure that all foods are covered to avoid cross-contamination and to maintain moisture levels. 

**Ice Cube Preparation and Defrosting**

Ice cubes should be prepared according to specifications, allowing adequate time for freezing. Should you need to defrost items, do so methodically, keeping track of the thickness of frost buildup and performing defrosting at least annually.

**Routine Maintenance and Cleaning**

Regular cleaning and maintenance are required for optimal operation. Disconnect the power supply before cleaning, and avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage the appliance. 

For light maintenance, ensure the light switches off appropriately and replaceable components are correctly handled during service. 

In summary, maintain best practices for food storage, cleaning, and appliance management to ensure longevity and efficiency of the COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC functions.

### Service Guidance for Appliance Cooling Issues

If the appliance is not cooling properly, indicated by a warning tone and flashing lights, it may require attention. The water function could also be affected, potentially leading to household lighting issues. If the appliance is too cold, temporarily adjust the operation settings as outlined in the Service Force information section.

Should there be frost build-up, normal operation sounds may be continuous. Contact AEG Service Force immediately if mechanical failures or breakdowns are suspected. Adhere to the purchase regulations aligned with safety and operational legislation (GSG, VBG, VDE).

If using this appliance with a heater requires ensuring that spaces remain airtight for effective heating. Ensure that recent food placement is proper and not obstructing airflow. European regulations (EU 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG) are applicable for safety and electromagnetic compatibility related to cooling performance.
