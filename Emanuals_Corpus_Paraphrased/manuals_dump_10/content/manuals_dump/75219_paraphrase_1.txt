### Heat Function Duration

The Heat Function Duration allows you to heat the unit without interruption. To engage this function, ensure that the heating element is off. Press the button for a few seconds until "DEMO" is displayed. This signifies that the cooking function is ready. Press the button again to turn it off after a few seconds, with a final confirmation to complete the setup.

When using the function, touch the ON/OFF button to activate it, and then select the desired cooking mode from memory.

### Cooking Guidelines

Proper placement of cookware is essential; ensure that it is positioned directly on the base and properly aligned with the preconfigured shelves. Be cautious of heat buildup in enclosed areas. Steam and other cooking materials might escape during the process, aiding in efficient cooking while ensuring a crusty finish.

Using various dish materials will impact cooking; for example, earthenware and glass allow for even heat distribution, while metal dishes enhance browning. The heating mechanism operates from both the top and bottom, allowing versatility in cooking different foods and achieving desirable browning effects.

### Temperature Control

Engage the oven by pressing the ON/OFF button, followed by selecting your desired temperature—a range from 30°C to 250°C is available. Preheating is crucial, as it helps maintain consistent cooking results. Follow the recommended cooking charts for optimal results, adjusting temperatures as necessary based on the thickness and type of food being cooked.

### Oven Types and Methods

For optimal cooking performance, utilize the various functions available, including conventional and fan oven methods. The fan function provides efficient air distribution for even cooking. Adjusting the shelf height can help further enhance cooking results, especially for larger dishes.

Switch between different functions as needed to prevent overheating, and keep track of your cooking progress to ensure desired outcomes. Avoid direct contact with heating elements to prevent damage or injury.

### Specific Cooking Recommendations

Each dish type, such as cakes, meats, and breads, requires specific settings. Follow the cooking charts for comprehensive guidelines tailored to your dish type, ensuring optimal temperatures and cooking durations to achieve perfect results every time.

Use the thermal grilling function for even cooking of thicker foods. Maintain an eye on thickness variations to adjust settings accordingly and use the preheating feature for best practices.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can maximize the efficiency of the heat functions and achieve desired culinary results systematically.

### Defrosting Instructions

The defrosting function operates without the use of heat, enhancing the process for various foods, including heat-sensitive items like iced cakes and yeast products. To initiate defrosting, press the "ON/OFF" button and select the defrosting option—this will appear on the display. Always ensure that food is thoroughly cooked immediately after thawing, as proper temperatures must be maintained throughout the defrosting process. Note that the temperature setting for the defrosting function cannot be altered.

### Cleaning Guidelines

Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and allow it to cool down. Clean the interior using mild cleaners and avoid harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces. If the appliance experiences significant buildup, stronger products like Brite may be used cautiously. 

Avoid using cleaners containing bleach, as they may cause surface damage. Clean the exterior and inner components, including shelf supports, with a soft cloth. Refer to the specific cleaning procedure for shelf removal, which involves unscrewing from the front to facilitate easy cleaning.

For catalytic components, avoid splashes of food and maintain high temperatures around 220°C for at least one hour to ensure cleanliness and efficiency. When replacing catalytic parts, adhere to specified guidelines regarding wattage and temperature ratings, as identified in the manufacturer's manual.

### Troubleshooting and Service Information

If issues arise during use, such as improper heating, condensation, or error indicators, consult the service section of the manual for guidance. In cases where the oven is not functioning as expected, contact Service Force for further assistance. Have your purchase details handy, including the model number and warranty information.
