### Technical Paraphrase

**Washing Instructions:**
This guide covers the proper washing conditions for various items, including white and colored sheets, tablecloths, household shirts, and garments made from synthetic or wool materials. Items such as lightly colored shirts are recommended to be washed at temperatures ranging from 95°C to cold settings (40°C and below). Specific washing cycles include "Wool," "Handwash," and "Synthetics/Delicates," which are optimized for delicate fabrics.

When using the washing machine, refer to the manual (M9604) for settings to prevent fabric creasing and to ensure appropriate temperatures (up to 60°C). For proper maintenance, items should be selected carefully, ensuring compatibility with the chosen cycle, and settings should be adjusted as necessary.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**
For optimal performance, the machine should be regularly maintained. Disconnect the appliance from electrical supply during cleaning routines. Ensure that filters and catchers are clear to prevent blockages, particularly in the emptying hose. Regularly inspect these components, and utilize the "Night" option for quiet operation at off-peak hours.

If issues arise during operation, such as error codes (E10, E20, E40), immediate troubleshooting is required. This may include checking the drain hose and ensuring there are no blockages affecting water flow.

**Installation Considerations:**
Ensure all hoses are correctly positioned and secured to prevent leaks. If any components appear damaged or if the hose is too short, consider acquiring replacements designed for this model (EWF series). Do not modify the appliance or the accompanying hoses beyond their designed specifications.

**Recycling and Disposal:**
When disposing of the appliance, follow local regulations regarding electronic waste and recycling. This should be done responsibly to mitigate any adverse environmental impact. Check with local authorities for specific disposal instructions. 

For further assistance or repairs, always work with certified service professionals to maintain warranty compliance and operational integrity.

### Declaration of Warranty Terms

This declaration outlines the warranty terms applicable to services provided. These terms are consistent with Union Directive 99/44/EC, ensuring the protection of consumer rights as mandated by this legislation. The statutory warranty covers claims made within two years from the date of purchase and is applicable exclusively to professional services and products affected by defects.

In the event of a defect, repairs will be carried out at no cost, provided that the claim is promptly reported. Proof of purchase must be presented for validation.

The warranty does not cover issues resulting from unauthorized repairs or installations, and consumers are advised that appliances requiring intricate setups, such as built-in models, fall under specific operational responsibilities. If the appliance has undergone repeated malfunctions due to misuse or mismatch with operational guidelines, the warranty becomes void.

In situations where a claim is to be made, documentation regarding the purchase, including the date and type of appliance, must be submitted within the warranty timeframe. Consumers are encouraged to consult technical instructions specific to their region.
