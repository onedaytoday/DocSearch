### Maintenance

**Cutting Deck Alignment**

To maintain proper alignment, ensure that the front of the cutting deck is positioned lower than the rear. Adjust the front and rear settings accordingly. After adjustments, verify the deck's level and ensure it sits properly on the ground. For any issues related to this alignment, consult a licensed service technician.
