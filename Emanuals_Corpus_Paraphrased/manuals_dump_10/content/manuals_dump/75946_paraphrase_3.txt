Dear Customer,

Please refer to these operating instructions for essential information about your appliance. They are intended for the use of appliance owners and cover warnings, functions, and installation procedures. For details regarding operation and troubleshooting, please consult the section titled "Technical Terminology."

If you encounter a malfunction, please reach out to AEG Service Force for assistance. Their contact information can be found at www.aeghome.co.uk or by reaching out to AEG Appliances, High Street, Slough SL1 DZ.

### Appliance Installation and Operation

Ensure your appliance is installed in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight and heat sources, to maintain optimal performance. The back of the appliance should maintain a specific clearance as outlined in the instructions. 

When handling the appliance:

- Take care not to expose the rear to extreme conditions such as high temperatures.
- Ensure the appliance is earthed to prevent electrical shock.

### User Safety Precautions

To avoid risks such as suffocation, do not allow children to play with the appliance. When cleaning, always switch off the appliance and disconnect it from the power supply. Note that unauthorized servicing is not recommended and may lead to further issues.

### Appliance Features

The appliance includes features like COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC for optimal cooling. Familiarize yourself with the buttons for adjusting temperature settings:

- The ON/OFF button will control the power supply.
- WARMER and COLDER buttons allow for temperature adjustments, with the desired temperature displayed as flashing numbers.

### Initial Setup

When first connecting the appliance:

1. Ensure it is upright for a minimum of a few hours to stabilize internal components.
2. After this period, you can switch it on, and any warning lights will indicate when the desired temperature is reached.

For any further questions about operations or specific troubleshooting, please consult the relevant sections in this manual or contact AEG Service Force.

### Recap on Features

The appliance's various buttons and operating lights will provide real-time feedback on the current and desired settings. If at any point you need to switch off the warnings, press the WARNING OFF button.

When adjusting the temperature, the appliance will automatically regulate itself, displaying current temperatures until adjustments are confirmed.

Please familiarize yourself with all the sections of this manual for comprehensive understanding and efficient operation of your SANTO KG appliance.

### COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC Functions

**COOLMATIC Function**: The COOLMATIC feature activates cooling based on your selection and keeps the interior light on during operation. It operates for a predetermined duration based on the chosen setting, which can be adjusted manually.

**FROSTMATIC Function**: The FROSTMATIC function is designed to quickly freeze fresh food while protecting items already stored. This feature can be activated by pressing the FROSTMATIC button, indicated by a yellow light. The function remains operational for a set number of hours unless manually turned off.

### Appliance Operation

To switch the appliance on or off, press both ON/OFF buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. A countdown will occur before the appliance powers down. If a power interruption occurs, the appliance will resume operation once power is restored. To manually switch off the appliance, hold both buttons down for several seconds.

### Temperature Monitoring

The appliance provides visual indicators and acoustic alerts if the temperature rises too high. The warning tone will sound if temperature thresholds are exceeded, assisting in food safety management. The warning will automatically deactivate once the temperature normalizes.

### Storage and Organization

Adjustable shelves allow for optimal organization of food items, ensuring adequate airflow. Heavy bottles should be positioned upright at the front of the shelves for stability. 

### Defrosting

Defrosting should be performed when ice buildup occurs, which typically collects at the back of the compartment. An ice thickness of about one yearâ€™s worth of use warrants a defrost cycle. Follow recommended procedures and avoid mechanical means to prevent damage.

### Cleaning

Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply. Use non-abrasive cleaners suitable for food storage areas. Regular cleaning helps maintain efficient operation.

### Monitoring Performance

If any performance issues arise, such as unusual sounds or lighting malfunctions, contact customer service for assistance. Should warning lights or sounds persist, they may indicate a fault requiring attention.

**Frost and Normal Sounds**

If the AEG appliance experiences a mechanical issue or breakdown, the AEG Service Force should be contacted immediately for assistance. It's important to note that the cooling system, known for its efficiency, functions by transferring heat away from the food stored inside, ensuring optimal preservation. The design incorporates sealed elements that manage this heat exchange, with the process efficiently cooling the internal environment.

The built-in heater is situated at the rear, facilitating seamless heat release to the surrounding area. Compliance with household regulations, including the GSG, VBG, and VDE standards, is essential. The appliance adheres to relevant EU directives (73/23/EWG, 89/336/EWG, and amendments including 92/31/EWG) ensuring safety and performance.

To the initial purchaser, AEG provides a warranty covering several months after purchase, which includes workmanship and installation performance. However, this warranty does not cover damages due to unauthorized repairs or modifications. Should the appliance require repairs, the purchaser must contact the authorized AEG service office, as all repaired units become property of AEG. 

If the appliance is relocated to another country within the EC, this warranty remains valid, and AEG will provide necessary support. Contact the AEG Service office for assistance in the UK or abroad.

For service inquiries or assistance, please call the AEG Service Force, providing clear details about the issue and your purchase information, which can be found on the rating plate. For additional information about AEG products, customers are encouraged to visit the AEG website or contact customer service.
