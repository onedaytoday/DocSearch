Keep this instruction manual for future reference. Should the appliance change ownership, ensure this guide is passed to the new owner. Proper functioning is critical for safety, and features designed to prevent accidents, such as child latches, should never be disabled. Children should not operate or play with the appliance. Always ensure it is turned off and unplugged before cleaning or when not in use.

Avoid exposing the appliance to direct sunlight and always position it in a well-ventilated area. Built-in installations must comply with service guidelines. For maintenance and repairs, contact authorized service professionals; DIY fixes can lead to serious damage or malfunction.
