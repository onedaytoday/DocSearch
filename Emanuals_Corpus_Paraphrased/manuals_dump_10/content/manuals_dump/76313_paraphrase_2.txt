Here’s a paraphrased version with a technical tone while preserving the original meaning:

Use cloth and grease for stains, and opt for either warm or cold water. For items that are already treated with bleach (applicable only to whites and colors), apply bleach lightly. For lipstick stains, use a suitable cloth, ensuring that you follow up with bleach very carefully. If bleach is needed, select the appropriate type based on fabric compatibility, ensuring thorough application.

Always refer to product instructions for prewashing capabilities, including the integration of additives for optimum washing performance. The choice of degree settings (preferably 60°C) should be made based on fabric specifications. 

Be sure to adhere to the guidelines for optimal detergent quantity based on the fabric type. Water classifications and suitable cleaning protocols should align with local water authority guidelines. Use French cleaning guidelines as a reference for selecting washing parameters and times.

For standard items such as sheets, tablecloths, and shirts, the washing conditions will vary (e.g., lightly or normally soiled). Synthetic fabrics also require specific settings depending on their color and type. Always prewash heavily soiled synthetic items to enhance cleaning efficiency.

For handwashed items, it is essential to disconnect power before maintenance procedures. Regular inspections and cleaning of the machine's components, including drain filters and hoses, are necessary to avoid issues. 

Perform routine checks for proper hose installation, ensuring no blockages or leaks. Ensure that the emptying hose is securely fastened after maintenance. Follow the prescribed steps if clearing blockages or performing service diagnostics. 

If malfunctions occur, such as for error codes E10, E20, or E40, investigate potential causes including hose issues or appliance settings. For service-related inquiries, reference product specifications and contact support if necessary. 

For unpacking and installation, ensure that all connections are secure and follow placement guidelines to avoid interference with drainage or appliance operation. 

Keep in mind that the specifications for fabric types and washing parameters are crucial for effective laundry processes, and always prioritize the highest temperature settings compatible with the designated fabric types.
