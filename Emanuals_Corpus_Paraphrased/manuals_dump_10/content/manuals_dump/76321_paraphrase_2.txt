**Stubbing** refers to the method of washing items, which can be carried out using cold or warm water, depending on the type of fabric. For whites and colorfast garments, bleach may be used sparingly. Stains like lipstick can be addressed using appropriate solutions, including bleach for removal.

It's important to follow specific protocols when selecting wash cycles and temperatures to ensure optimal cleaning. Typically, a temperature of 60°C is recommended for standard fabrics. Prewash options are available for heavily soiled whites and colors. For synthetics, normal cycles are best, and a reduced spin cycle can be employed for delicate fabrics like wool.

**Maintenance Guidelines:**

- Regularly clean the lint filter and ensure that hose connections are secure to prevent clogs.
- If blockages occur, turn off the power, disconnect the hose, and clear any obstructions manually.
- For emergency emptying, follow specified procedures to avoid overflow.

**Error Indicators:**
If error codes such as E10 or E20 arise, they denote issues like improper connections or clogs in the system. Refer to the troubleshooting guide for appropriate resolutions.

**Installation Instructions:**
Ensure that hoses are correctly positioned to prevent kinks or pressure buildup. Verify that all connections adhere to local authority regulations for safe operation.

**Electrical Specifications:**
Use a single-phase supply with proper grounding to mitigate risks. Should any component fail, replacement should only be carried out by qualified personnel.

**Assembly:**
When assembling, ensure that all components fit securely and that no hoses obstruct movement to maintain operational efficiency.

This maintains the essential meanings and nuances while presenting them in a clearer, more technical format.

To install the component, begin by securing the fixing (B) to the designated area. Align the screws (B) with the mounting brackets, ensuring they are properly fitted. Adjust the thickness of the mounting to align perfectly with screw (B) for optimal performance. The operation of this setup must be carefully calibrated for the intended application. If there are discrepancies in the alignment, verify that the plates are correctly positioned.

For mounting the countermagnet, ensure it is integrated effectively during the installation process. Adjust the height as needed, securing it to the designated points using four fixing screws. These screws should be countersunk to allow for proper clearance at the top and maintain security.
