For further assistance or specific inquiries, refer to the operation manual or customer service.

The IQ-Touch™ interface requires a firm touch for activation. There are three options for crushed ice and water, which can be accessed by touching the corresponding buttons. Pressing each option for three seconds activates the desired feature while conserving energy. This manual activation can also turn off sound notifications according to user preference. Sounds are muted when the warning signal is activated. Factory settings can be restored by pressing the button for three seconds, ensuring the cooling system is properly cleaned.

To make adjustments to shelves, use a screwdriver to securely tighten shelf spacers by turning them clockwise. For the installation, remember to turn the spacers counterclockwise when adjusting their location. The shelves are designed for easy access and cleaning, enabling the storage of fresh food.

The Perfect Temperature Device (PTD) maintains food at an optimal temperature. When first connected, the PTD is turned off. Users can initiate it by pressing the On/Off button and selecting desired temperature settings via the control panel. The temperature settings range from 28°F to 42°F, and users must hold the button for three seconds to deactivate the lock feature.

Operational cleanliness is essential; therefore, it is crucial to wipe down the unit with a cloth and avoid using harsh chemicals. The assembly of shelves requires careful handling, ensuring they are locked in properly.

For the water supply system, proper connection is critical to prevent malfunction. The system comes with a shut-off valve and should be flushed before the first use. The arm that dispenses ice needs to be manually controlled to ensure proper functioning. Regular cleaning and maintenance are recommended to prevent blockages.

In terms of functionality, users should avoid overfilling the ice molds, which could lead to clogs. Careful attention to installation and connection will ensure optimal performance of both the water and ice dispensing features.

### Advanced Information on PureAdvantage Technology

The PureAdvantage™ system is rigorously tested and certified by NSF International, a respected nonprofit organization focusing on public health. This certification ensures the system meets ANSI/NSF standards for specified performance and reduction capabilities, including both disinfected and non-disinfected conditions. 

To operate the PureAdvantage™ system, ensure the supply is turned off and ready to dispense water. Activate the system by turning the switch, then releasing water from the designated outlet until it flows freely. You should hear a sound indicating the system is functioning properly as you release water for about three seconds.

### Food Storage Guidelines

To optimize food storage, avoid overcrowding shelves, which can hinder circulation and cooling. Store meat securely and separately from other foods, maintaining proper temperature. Airflow is crucial; food should be arranged to allow for unobstructed airflow. Items should be sealed tightly to prevent freezer burn and maintain freshness. 

Ensure that the refrigerator’s interior does not block airflow and is appropriately insulated. Mechanical operations may be compromised by cluttered shelves or excessive food loading.

### Normal Operation Sounds and Visual Cues

During normal operation, you may notice various sounds. High-efficiency units might produce noticeable operational noises, such as a hissing sound from the defrost heater or clicking when turning on or off. Other common sounds may include the circulation of forced air, particularly when the cooling system is engaged.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

To maintain the appliance's appearance and ensure optimal performance, it is essential to clean it regularly using appropriate cleaners. Avoid abrasive products or those containing bleach on sensitive surfaces. Turn off the appliance and disconnect it from the power source before beginning any cleaning. 

If the appliance is used in a climate where direct sunlight might affect its efficiency, ensure adequate insulation and ventilation around the appliance.

### Warranty Information

The product is covered under warranty for defects in materials and workmanship when maintained according to the guidelines. Any service must be performed by authorized personnel; otherwise, warranty coverage may be voided. 

Claims based on implied warranties, including those for merchantability or fitness for a specific purpose, are limited to one year or the shortest duration allowed by law. Electrolux is not liable for any consequential damages resulting from warranty breaches. This warranty provides specific legal rights which may vary by state.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues 

If operational issues arise, such as the system not cooling efficiently or indicator lights flashing, check the power supply and ensure all connections are secure. It may also be necessary to troubleshoot internal components if food items are not being preserved adequately. Regular maintenance will help identify and resolve any performance problems. 

For persistent issues or repairs, contact an authorized service representative.

**Common Water/Moisture/Frost Correction**

To address issues with water accumulation or moisture, the system uses a Correction Connector, which corroborates with CE standards. If the indicator shows LOC when three buttons are pressed simultaneously, this may signal a fault in the weather section. It's crucial to monitor this section, as excessive temperature fluctuations can lead to frost buildup and internal sweating, necessitating regular cleaning to prevent water collection.

The water supply must connect adequately to the household system. If there are blockages, the water flow will be restricted; therefore, it’s essential to ensure that the connector is firmly seated. Regular checks should confirm that the household supply is functioning without interchange — particularly if ice or food remnants are obstructions.

**Ice Correction**

Household supplies must remain free from obstructions to avoid ice blockage. If the water supply is not connected correctly, this could lead to flooding or insufficient water flow. Be vigilant of unit shut-off mechanisms, which prevent overflow, particularly in warmer conditions. Make sure to systematically clean the supply channels and monitor for clogs that might hinder performance.

**Lighting Issues**

If the correction light is not illuminated, this might indicate a blockage or failure within the unit. Both surfaces and light tracks must be cleaned regularly to ensure proper functionality. Touching the shelf or other items may inadvertently disrupt light operation. To counter this, turn off the light and clean the switch or sections related to light functioning, ensuring an unobstructed and clean environment for optimal performance.
