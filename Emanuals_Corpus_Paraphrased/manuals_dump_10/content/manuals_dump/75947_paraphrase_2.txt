**COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC Functions**

**COOLMATIC Function:** The COOLMATIC feature initiates cooling for selected items. When activated, a yellow indicator light illuminates, displaying the current temperature and settings. The user may manually adjust these settings by pressing the corresponding button. 

**FROSTMATIC Function:** This feature is designed to preserve fresh food items by quickly freezing them. When activated, a yellow light indicates its status. The user can turn it on or off manually, with the function automatically deactivating after a set number of hours. If the button is held down, the FROSTMATIC function will switch off after a countdown period.

**Operating the Appliance:** To turn off the appliance, hold both ON/OFF buttons for several seconds until it shuts down. The appliance will reset if unplugged, and all functions will need to be restarted.

**Temperature Management:** It is crucial to monitor the temperature levels to prevent spoilage and mold. Items should be properly organized and stored in respective compartments to maintain optimal conditions. A thermometer can help ensure the internal temperature is appropriate, typically below 3°C for fresh meats.

**Accessory Usage:** The shelves and racks should be adjusted for optimal placement of bottles and other food items to ensure air circulation. Bottles should be placed with their necks facing forward for better stability.

**General Precautions:** Foods should be covered to prevent cross-contamination and to maintain hygiene. Regular checks on the food condition are recommended to prevent spoilage.

**Warning Indicators:** The appliance will emit acoustic warnings if the temperature rises above acceptable levels, indicating potential issues with food safety or appliance operation. These alerts can be silenced using the WARNING OFF button.

**Defrosting Guidance:** For successful defrosting, it is important to remove frost build-up regularly. Defrosting should be conducted when the appliance is empty or has minimal load to facilitate proper air circulation.

**Maintenance:** Disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply before cleaning. Use non-corrosive cleaning products, avoiding bleach or harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces. Clean interior sections regularly to maintain hygiene and operational efficiency.

**Service and Support:** If warning indicators persist or the appliance shows signs of malfunction, contact Service Force for assistance. Maintain a record of operational issues for accurate diagnostics.

By following these guidelines, optimal performance and food safety can be achieved.

**Frost and Normal Operating Sounds**

If customers experience a mechanical issue or breakdown, they should contact AEG Service Force. It's essential to understand that the cooling process, commonly referred to as refrigeration, extracts warmth from food and circulates it to maintain a closed system. This heat is moved away from the interior of the unit and dissipated into the surroundings.

The AEG appliance features a built-in heater located at the rear, which aids in this heat management process. Generally, heat is released efficiently, following local regulations for household appliances, including the GSG, VBG, and VDE standards. The appliance also complies with EU directives, including 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG (along with 92/31/EWG).

AEG offers warranty coverage to the original purchaser for several months, which includes defects in material or workmanship. However, this warranty excludes issues arising from unauthorized repairs or improper installation. If repairs are needed, the customer should contact an authorized AEG service office. All repaired parts become the property of AEG, and the warranty rights remain intact even if the customer relocates within the European Community.

For assistance regarding repairs or purchases, customers can reach AEG Service Force via phone or through written communication. Important information, such as the Product Number (PNC), can be found on the rating plate of the appliance.
