To ensure secure mounting, confirm that the device is properly affixed in the designated area, whether it is retracted or deployed. The installation site should allow for appropriate screw placement about an inch from the edge of the mount. Ensure the back of the mount is aligned correctly.

The Slow Retract Mechanism (SRM) enables smooth retraction without impacting the integrity of the device. When adjusting the device, avoid applying excessive force, as improper handling may damage internal components. For cleaning, use a soft cloth to wipe the housing.

The specifications for the screen models include various aspect ratios and height measurements to assist with installation. Warranty details specify coverage for refurbishment and workmanship, with timeframes differing based on purchase type. Unauthorized returns will be declined, and any warranty claims must be reported within the stipulated timeframe.
