### Instructions for Selecting Rinse Hold and Delay Timer

**Rinse Hold Selection**  
To activate the Rinse Hold function (Arret Cuve Pleine/Spoelstop), ensure to select this option prior to starting the cycle. If Rinse Hold is engaged, the washing process can be halted without draining the water. You may proceed to select from various wash programs including Cottons/Linens, Energy Saving, Easy-Cares/Easy Iron, Delicates, or Wool/Silk (Handwash).

**Starting and Pausing**  
To begin the wash, press the START/PAUSE button. If the END light (Fin/einde) is flashing upon pressing START/PAUSE, check that the door is securely closed. If not, close the door and press START/PAUSE again.

**Ending a Cycle**  
After the wash cycle is completed, indicated by the illuminated END light, you can choose to switch the appliance off or proceed to Drain or Spin by selecting the respective options. If Rinse Hold is chosen, the cycle will pause and you can then decide to drain or spin the laundry.

**Maintenance**  
Regularly clean the appliance by wiping surfaces with a cloth. Ensure that any cleaning agents used are suitable for appliance surfaces. Avoid abrasive cleaners to prevent damage.

**Troubleshooting**  
In case of issues, refer to Customer Service for assistance. If the END light flashes, this indicates a potential malfunction or that the door is not properly secured. Follow the given instructions to rectify the issue, such as checking hose connections or ensuring the water supply is adequate.

For any further inquiries, consult the user manual or contact customer support. Always adhere to the operational guidelines for the best results and safety.

**Emptying the Hose and Covering the Machine:**

To evacuate the emptying hose, rotate it tightly in a clockwise direction.

Securely screw the cover back on by rotating it clockwise.
