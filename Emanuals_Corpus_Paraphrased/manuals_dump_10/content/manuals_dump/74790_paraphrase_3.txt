I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

**FROSTMATIC Function Operation and Maintenance**

The FROSTMATIC function is indicated by a yellow light, which remains illuminated while the function is active. This function helps preserve the freshness of food. It can be activated or deactivated manually. When frost builds up inside the appliance, regular maintenance is necessary; thick frost can impact performance. Use the provided guide to initiate defrosting when the frost layer becomes substantial. 

To defrost, remove food items, and switch off the appliance. Once defrosting is complete, wipe the interior with a cloth and allow it to dry. Do not use abrasive cleaners; instead, opt for mild commercial products.

For optimal operation, ensure that the food is covered appropriately, preferably with airtight containers or polythene wraps, to maintain quality and minimize odor transfer. If you experience malfunctions, refer to the troubleshooting section, and contact Service Force for repairs.

**Important Maintenance Alerts:**

1. Always disconnect the power before conducting cleaning or maintenance to prevent electric shock.
2. Ensure food items are stored correctly to avoid uneven cooling or excessive frost.
3. The appliance should be checked regularly for any frost buildup and cleaned as needed. 

If the frost light flashes, it indicates a functioning anomaly or a maintenance-required state. Follow necessary procedures to resolve such issues, including adjusting the thermostat as instructed. 

For additional assistance or parts, reach out to Service Force directly or consult the official website for support.
