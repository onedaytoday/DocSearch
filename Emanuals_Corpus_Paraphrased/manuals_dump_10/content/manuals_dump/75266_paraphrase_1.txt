### Important Safety Instructions:
To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury, follow these essential instructions:
- Ensure the appliance is properly installed and grounded according to National ANSI/NFPA (USA) or CSA C22.1 standards.
- Disconnect power before servicing; only authorized technicians should perform repairs.
- Allow the unit to cool before touching any interior components—heating elements and surfaces can cause burns.
- Keep flammable materials, like cloths and cookbooks, away from the oven.
- Children should not be left unattended near the appliance. Ensure they understand the dangers of the oven.
- Do not touch hot surfaces, and smother grease fires with appropriate extinguishing methods.

### Oven Control Pad Functions:
Each button on the control pad serves specific functions, as detailed below:
- **Convection:** Use for convection cooking.
- **Preheat:** Starts the preheating process.
- **Clean:** Initiates the cleaning cycle.
- **Light:** Turns the oven light on or off.
- **Clock:** Adjusts the time.
- **Bake:** Sets the baking temperature.

### Setting the Clock:
To set the clock:
1. Press and hold the "CLOCK" button until it beeps.
2. Input the hour using the number pad, followed by AM or PM designation.
3. Press "START" to confirm.

### Oven Features:
- **Continuous Bake / Hour Energy Saving:** Options to keep the oven on or save energy by turning it off automatically after a set time.
- **Kitchen Timer:** Use to track cooking times.
- **Oven Lockout Feature:** Locks the oven controls to prevent accidental use.

### Temperature Display Settings:
Switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius by holding the respective buttons until the display changes.

### Adjusting Oven Temperature:
If you find the oven temperature isn’t accurate:
1. Press and hold the adjustment buttons to either increase or decrease the temperature in increments.

### Preheating Instructions:
To preheat the oven:
1. Select the desired temperature (e.g., 350°F).
2. Wait for the preheat indicator to illuminate; the oven is ready once it reaches the set temperature.

For further assistance, refer to the user manual or contact customer support. Always follow safety guidelines for proper appliance use and maintenance.

### BAKING INSTRUCTIONS

**Preheating:** Preheat the oven as specified, typically to 350°F (175°C). For preheating at 425°F (218°C), adjust from 350°F. Ensure there is space around items for proper air circulation. Avoid overheating or overcrowding, which can lead to uneven cooking or warping.

If following a recipe, note the recommended temperature adjustments and cooking times, keeping in mind that items should not touch each other to ensure even heat distribution.

---

### CONVECTION BAKING

Convection baking utilizes a fan located at the back of the oven to circulate hot air around the food, promoting even cooking and faster preparation times. This method is ideal for batch cooking and defrosting, as it reduces cooking time. 

When using convection, follow the specified temperature settings and consider reducing the cooking time and temperature to avoid overcooking. Ensure that food is spaced adequately to facilitate airflow.

---

### TIMED BAKE OR TIMED CONVECTION BAKE

To set the Timed Bake function (or its Convection counterpart), program the desired temperature (e.g., 350°F) and cooking duration. The oven will automatically turn off when the set time elapses. Monitor the progress through the display.

---

### DELAYED TIMED BAKE OR DELAYED TIMED CONVECTION BAKE

If you wish to use the Delayed Timed Bake function, configure the desired start time and cooking temperature (e.g., 350°F). Ensure that food is arranged properly. The oven will begin cooking at the scheduled time and shut off automatically once the cooking duration is complete.

---

### BROILING INSTRUCTIONS

For broiling meats, preheat the broiler until it reaches a red-hot state. Position food to facilitate even cooking and avoid grease buildup that may ignite. Cook with constant attention to prevent burning and follow specific recipe guidelines for food thickness and timing.

**Important Safety Note:** Do not cover the broiler pan, as this can cause grease fires. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; use a fire extinguisher instead.

---

### CONVECTION ROASTING

During convection roasting, the oven's fan helps circulate hot air around the meat, enhancing cooking efficiency. Make sure food is correctly positioned and that there is sufficient space to maintain airflow.

---

### STARTING SELF-CLEAN CYCLE

To initiate the self-cleaning function, confirm that the oven is cooled and that the door is securely closed. The cycle may take about 2 to 3 hours depending on the chosen cleaning level (light or heavy). 

**Safety Notification:** The oven will lock during the cleaning process. Ensure that children are kept at a safe distance, and do not attempt to force the door open while the cycle is active. Once completed, allow the oven to cool before opening.

### Cleaning

**To Initiate the Delayed Self-Clean Cycle:**
1. Refer to the Clean function settings. 
2. Ensure the oven door is closed. 
3. To start the self-cleaning process, press the appropriate buttons to set the desired time. 

**Note:** The self-cleaning feature operates automatically based on the clock settings. If the clock is set, the self-cleaning cycle will start after the designated hours and will turn off once complete. If you select a time for cleaning, the "DOOR LOCKED" light will flash, indicating the cycle is in progress. 

**After Self-Cleaning:**
Once the cycle concludes, the "DOOR LOCKED" indicator will remain displayed until the oven cools down—approximately one hour.

### General Cleaning

- **Routine Cleaning:** Immediately address spills and heavy soiling to minimize the need for extensive cleanings later. 
- **Surface Care:** Use a soft cloth for painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces; avoid abrasive cleaners to prevent scratches. 
- **Oven Care:** For heavy grease buildup, apply cleaner directly with a cloth. Do not use heavy-duty cleaners or scouring pads as they may damage surfaces. 

### Oven Light

- The oven light can be accessed via the switch located on the front, and it should be manually cleaned when necessary. **Caution:** Ensure the oven is cool before servicing. 

### Important Service Information

- If you encounter beeping and error codes F1 through F10, press "CANCEL" to reset. If the error persists, consult an authorized servicer for assistance. 
- **Light and Self-Cleaning Issues:** 
  - If the oven light is not working, replace the bulb following the standard instructions. 
  - Ensure secure electrical connections; if the oven does not operate correctly after installation, check for tripped breakers or blown fuses. 

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Excessive Smoke During Broiling:** Adjust the position of the meat for better clearance, and ensure proper preheating.
- **Incomplete Soil Removal Post Self-Cleaning:** If residue remains, consider a secondary clean with the self-cleaning function, ensuring optimal settings were applied initially.
