### Food Storage Guidelines

To maintain food freshness, avoid overcrowding shelves, as this can hinder airflow and cooling efficiency. Ensure meat and various other foods are stored securely and are shielded from sunlight to prevent overheating. Also, refrain from placing heat-producing appliances, like dishwashers, near food storage areas. 

Regularly clean and organize the cabinet space to optimize airflow and prevent food from becoming trapped. It's recommended that if a refrigerator is not used for over three months, it should be thoroughly cleaned, especially with respect to electrical cords and connections. 

**Cleaning Instructions:** Clean surfaces using non-abrasive cloths and appropriate cleaning solutions, avoiding any products that could scratch or damage surfaces. Follow manufacturer guidelines for using cleaning agents.

### Warranty Information

For warranty services related to workmanship, common issues may arise regarding display errors (E7, E8, E9) or unusual sounds during operation. If the unit is not cooling properly and there are irregular sounds, it may be due to a blown circuit or improper food placement. Check that vents are clear and doors are fully sealed.

If the refrigerator is not running, ensure that the electrical supply is stable and that it is not in 'Control Lock' mode. It’s advisable to allow the refrigerator several hours to reach optimal cooling temperatures after adjustments have been made.

**Common Issues and Solutions:**
- If sounds are heard while cooling, this might be normal operational noise.
- Ensure the unit is level and that the door seals are intact.
- Perform regular maintenance to prevent frost buildup and ensure electrical connections are in good condition. 

For immediate assistance, contact customer service, ensuring to provide details related to any error codes displayed.
