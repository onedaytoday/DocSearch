The following instructions cover the correct use and maintenance of your appliance, particularly regarding cleaning and operation. Please refer to these guidelines to ensure optimal performance and compliance with safety regulations.

**Installation and Setup**

When unpacking your appliance, ensure that all components are present as detailed in this manual. Wall mounting options are available, and proper adherence to the instructions is essential for safe installation. Note that the hose may need to be purchased separately.

Ensure that the appliance’s outlet is connected properly and in compliance with national regulations. Any issues related to combustion must be addressed as per local authority guidelines.

**Operation Guidelines**

Maintain a distance from cooking surfaces while ensuring adequate airflow to prevent overheating. A dirty appliance can increase the risk of ignition and fire hazards. It’s crucial to disconnect the device from the power source during cleaning and maintenance to avoid electric shock.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning the appliance regularly is essential. Use a damp cloth or appropriate cleaning products to maintain its surface, particularly focusing on areas prone to grease build-up. It's important to operate the dishwasher at a minimum of 65°C when cleaning grease filters for optimal results.

The charcoal filters must be cleaned or replaced periodically to maintain performance. Generally, these should be cleaned monthly; however, if you notice reduced capacity, consider reactivating or replacing them.

**Troubleshooting Common Issues**

If the appliance is not functioning correctly, check the following:

1. Ensure it is properly connected to the electricity supply.
2. Verify that grease filters are clean.
3. Confirm that charcoal filters are effective and not blocked.

If the problem persists after following these checks, contact Service Force for assistance.
