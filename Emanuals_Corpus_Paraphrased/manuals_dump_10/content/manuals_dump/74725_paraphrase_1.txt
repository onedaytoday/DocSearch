### Normal Sounds: Tips and Hints

When operating the appliance, you may notice sounds from the cooling system or other internal components. These noises can result from airflow or heating issues, particularly if airflow is obstructed. To maintain optimum performance, ensure that food items are stored correctly and that the refrigerator is functioning efficiently. 

The thermostat may produce whirring sounds as it regulates temperatures, and you might hear the compressor running. It's essential to check for proper closure of the doors, as a seal that isn’t airtight can lead to frost build-up or reduced cooling efficiency. 

### Food Storage Guidelines

All food items, whether fresh, cooked, or frozen, should be properly covered. For instance:
- **Shellfish and Meats:** Should be stored in airtight containers to prevent freezer burn.
- **Ice Cream:** Should be kept covered to avoid freezer crystals.
- **Breads:** Can also freeze well when stored properly. 

When storing food, avoid crowding to ensure airflow around each item. Use food-safe packaging, such as polythene wrap, to maintain freshness.

### Appliance Operation

The appliance features various controls to manage operation:
- **Thermostat Adjustment:** Use the thermostat to control the temperature according to your needs. Ideally, higher settings are for colder environments.
- **Fast-Freezing Feature:** Activate as necessary to quickly freeze fresh foods, allowing you to preserve quality.

### General Safety Information

Always adhere to safety instructions to ensure proper operation:
- Do not block vents or airflow.
- When defrosting, avoid using sharp utensils to prevent damage.
