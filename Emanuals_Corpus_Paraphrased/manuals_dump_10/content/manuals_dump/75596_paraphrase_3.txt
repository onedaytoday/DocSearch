Thank you for your attention to these instructions for the safe and efficient use of your appliance.

To adjust the shelf height, please account for the upward and downward movement of the bottle. Position the bottle appropriately, as this will affect the air circulation and temperature distribution. Remember that the lowest shelf tends to be cooler, while the top shelf retains more heat, which can lead to accelerated spoilage of food.

Ensure that food items are either covered or packaged to maintain freshness and prevent cross-contamination. Use airtight containers or wraps to store food effectively. Keep fresh food at around 18°C, and be cautious with items that have already begun to spoil. For optimal results, allow food to reach the recommended temperature before use.

The FROSTMATIC function can be manually activated to rapidly freeze food within a specified timeframe. Note that the yellow indicator light will illuminate until this function is turned off, at which point regular operation will resume. For best practices, utilize thick wraps or containers for freezing to minimize air exposure, which can harm food quality.

When defrosting, ensure frost build-up is cleaned regularly according to the guidelines for safety and efficacy. Always disconnect from the power supply before cleaning and avoid using harsh chemicals that may damage the appliance or pose health risks. 

Be informed that regular maintenance is crucial to avoid issues; if you encounter any operational malfunctions, follow the prescribed troubleshooting steps. If the appliance operates too cold or too warm, check the settings and ensure proper function. 

Lastly, be attentive to any abnormal sounds during operation, as these may indicate mechanical issues. Compliance with local safety regulations is essential to ensure safe usage.
