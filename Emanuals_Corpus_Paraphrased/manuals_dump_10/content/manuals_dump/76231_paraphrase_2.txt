### Delay Timer Instructions

The DELAY TIMER (ZEITVORWAHL, DEPART DIFFERE) enables you to set a start time for your washing cycle, allowing for a delay of several hours. You can adjust the DELAY TIMER as needed according to the hours displayed. Once set and activated, press the START/PAUSE button. 

For cycles incorporating soaking, make sure the SOAKING option is selected. The display will indicate the soaking and prewash phases. Ensure that the DOOR (TR, PORTE) is securely closed before activating START/PAUSE. If the door is not closed correctly, the E40 and MAIN WASH (HAUPTWSCHE, LAVAGE) indicators will flash.

When setting the DELAY TIMER, keep in mind to sort and load items based on their fabric types. Always make sure items are securely placed in the drum to ensure proper operation of the machine.

**Pre-Wash and Treatment Compartments**

Follow the guidance for loading the right amount of detergent into the respective compartments (including prewash, conditioner, and starch). Exceeding the MAX fill line can lead to operational issues. Confirm that the selected washing cycle complies with the machine's instructions. 

To begin the wash or cancel any selected prewash, press START/PAUSE. If you wish to modify or abort the pre-selection, the DELAY TIMER can be adjusted until the desired time is displayed. 

**Post-Cycle Instructions**

After completing the cycle, if RINSE HOLD (SPLSTOPP, SANS ESSOR.) is selected, the START/PAUSE indicator will flash. To finalize, press START/PAUSE to switch off, then proceed to display the END (ENDE, FIN) light. It is essential to turn off the machine and check for any overflow or dosing errors indicated by warning lights.

**Care and Maintenance**

Regularly clean the chamber with a soft cloth and avoid abrasive materials. Ensure that all components, especially those part of the water supply and drainage systems, are correctly installed and maintained. Use only recommended detergents and consult Customer Service for any persistent issues or repairs covered under warranty.

If an error code (E10, E20, E40) appears during operation, consult your troubleshooting guide. Children should be kept away from the appliance while in use. 

Always adhere to safety and operational guidelines laid out in the appliance manual to optimize performance and longevity.

### Instructions for Use

**Operation of the Tional Tons**  
Ensure that the proper light is activated when the Tional Tons are pressed. If the results are unsatisfactory, verify whether the product was pretreated appropriately or if there are residues from creams, greases, or detergents—which could indicate incorrect usage. If rinsing is insufficient, remove any insoluble residues. The selection of the correct cleaning product is essential for optimal performance.

**Emergency Emptying Procedure**  
In the event of frost, perform the following steps: detach the emptying hose from the designated area and proceed with the emptying operation. **Warning:** Always turn off the system before initiating the emptying process to avoid burns. Allow any collected water to cool before handling. To detach the hose, turn it anticlockwise, ensuring it is free from any obstructions.

**Maintenance Instructions**  
To maintain the system, regularly inspect and securely fasten the cover in a clockwise manner after accessing the housing. The machinery is designed to be maintenance-free; however, if any malfunctions arise, please consult the provided instructions.

### Additional Features (RINSE+/SPLEN+/RINCAGE+)  
Utilize RINSE+ for fabrics classified as COTTONS/LINEN, EASY-CARES, and DELICATES. This option can enhance the washing process when used with PRE WASH and QUICK WASH settings. Ensure that the RINSE+ indicator is lit for optimal performance.

**Child Lock Feature**  
To prevent unauthorized use, engage the child lock by rotating the device as directed. Ensure the lock is properly activated to keep the system secured.
