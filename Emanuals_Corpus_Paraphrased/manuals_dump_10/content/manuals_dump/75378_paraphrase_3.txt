**Wall and Information Cleaning Guidelines for Common Warranty Coverage**

These instructions reference critical safety information. Following these guidelines is essential to avoid serious injury or property damage. Ensure that the installation is performed by a qualified technician in accordance with the National ANSI Z223.1/NFPA standards. 

**Warning:** Do not operate the appliance for at least 2 hours when the temperature is at 0°C/32°F. To avoid potential hazards, prevent access to the appliance for children and keep flammable materials, such as cloth items, cookbooks, and plasticware, away from the vicinity.

**Caution:** The interior oven burner and surfaces can become extremely hot. Allow them to cool before touching. Wear appropriate clothing while using the oven. In case of a fire, extinguish using an appropriate type of fire extinguisher; do not use water on grease fires.

**Important:** Do not heat unopened food containers due to the risk of bursting. Make sure the oven ducts are unobstructed for proper ventilation.

**Safety Notice:** This appliance is subject to California's Proposition 65 regarding exposure to chemicals known to the state to cause serious health issues. Always ensure the oven is properly grounded to prevent electric shock. 

**Grounding Instructions:** It is crucial that this appliance is installed with proper grounding. Do not remove the grounding prong from the power cord plug or use an adapter. Refer to the installation instructions for detailed grounding information. Using a two-prong adapter or extension cord is not recommended.

**Rack Management:** Always arrange oven racks when cool to ensure proper heat circulation. Avoid overcrowding pans, which can disrupt heat distribution.

**Preheating:** Always preheat the oven as instructed, particularly for baking items such as cookies and cakes. Monitor closely to adjust as needed – avoid overcrowding to ensure optimal cooking.

**Cleaning Guidelines:**
1. Keep the oven clean to prevent grease build-up, which can lead to fires. 
2. For self-cleaning models, follow specific procedures outlined for effective cleaning.
3. Use the appropriate cleaning materials. Avoid harsh chemicals that can scratch surfaces.
4. Clean spills promptly after cooking when the oven is still warm, using soft cloths or non-abrasive cleaners.

In summary, adhere strictly to these safety and maintenance instructions for optimal appliance performance and safety.

**Cleaning Instructions**

To maintain optimal performance, promptly address spills and heavy soiling. Regular cleaning reduces the need for extensive cleaning later. 

Before cleaning, ensure the appliance has cooled down. When cleaning manually, always wear proper protective gear. Avoid using high-moisture foods (like stews) during the cleaning process. Allow the appliance to remain closed for overnight or several hours after use. Use a damp cloth for cleaning; if scrubbing is necessary, follow product instructions carefully. Do not mix cleaners. 

Clean areas include the oven’s interior, front, and exterior surfaces, avoiding electrical components, switches, or any fire-prone areas. Make sure not to jeopardize the appliance's ability to heat correctly and avoid using cleaners that could damage painted surfaces. 

**Self-Cleaning Feature**

The self-cleaning function operates at high temperatures to eliminate residues, reducing them to ash. Allow the oven to cool before attempting to clean manually; avoid contact with high-temperature areas during the cleaning cycle. 

If your appliance has excessive soil build-up and self-cleaning is in use, sounds may indicate normal operation, and odors may occur as residues burn off. Follow appropriate cleaning protocols for both self-cleaning and regular maintenance. 

**Troubleshooting**

In case of issues like a tripped house circuit or poor light functionality, consult an authorized serviceman. Ensure house lights are operational and securely connected. 

If meat or grease-related items are improperly prepared, adjust cooking times and techniques, keeping food spaced adequately to prevent curling or uneven cooking.
