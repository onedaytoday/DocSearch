### Final Notes

Make sure all cooking functions are operated with care, and ensure the internal cavity is pre-heated appropriately for optimal cooking performance. Regularly consult this manual alongside local recycling guidelines to dispose of the unit responsibly at the end of its service life.

The cooking function uses heated air circulation to enhance preheating and cooking processes. Typically, preheating reaches temperatures of 190-200°C, allowing for better cooking results. Always refer to the recommended cooking chart, which suggests reducing temperatures by 20-25°C when using this method.

The heating element is located at the top, ensuring that food cooks evenly—especially for dishes like cakes. When activating the function, the thermostat light indicates when the desired temperature has been reached, cycling on and off to regulate heat.

Cooling of the appliance occurs continuously after cooking, ensuring safety before the unit is switched off. Note that food items should be spaced properly on the shelves to facilitate even cooking, and thicker items may require adjustments according to their size.

When defrosting, the function operates without heat to thaw foods like cakes and yeast products. It's crucial to cook all defrosted items immediately for food safety.

For maintenance, the appliance should be cleaned regularly with non-abrasive materials. Avoid using bleach or strong chemicals that could damage finishes. If the oven cavity shows significant buildup, a targeted cleaning cycle at high temperatures may be necessary.

Replacement of components such as bulbs must adhere to specified wattage and type. Proper installation of electrical parts is essential for safe operation, and all appliances must be correctly earthed. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for installation and care to ensure safety and performance.
