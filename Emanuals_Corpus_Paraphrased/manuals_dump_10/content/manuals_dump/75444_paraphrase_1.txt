#### Tools Required for LP Conversion:
- Nut Driver
- Open-End Wrench
- Wide Flat Blade Screwdriver
- Phillips Screwdriver

#### Conversion from Natural Gas to LP Gas
To convert the range for LP gas use, adjustments to the burners and orifices must be made, as the BTU ratings will differ. Ensure the following modifications are completed:

1. **Convert the Pressure Regulator:**
   - Locate the pressure regulator on the right side and remove it. 
   - Unscrew the regulator, turn it around, and reattach it facing the correct direction.

2. **Top Burner Conversion:**
   - Unscrew the burner heads from their bases.
   - Replace the factory natural gas orifices with the LP equivalents.
   - Ensure each connection is tightened securely.

3. **Oven Burner Orifice Conversion:**
   - Adjust the screws on the oven burner assembly and replace the orifice as needed.

4. **Broil Burner Orifice Conversion:**
   - Follow a similar process to convert the broil burner orifice to LP specifications.

5. **Griddle Orifice Conversion:**
   - For models with griddles, replace the orifice while ensuring connections are secure.

6. **Gas Valve Adjustment:**
   - Adjust each gas valve accordingly to accommodate LP gas.

#### Reconnecting Gas and Power Supply to the Range
Before reconnecting, ensure tightness of all connections and perform necessary leak tests. Reconnect the gas supply and electrical connections as instructed, ensuring the system is isolated during the process.

#### Air Shutter Adjustment for Oven Burner
- Adjust the air shutter to the specified dimensions for optimal performance. Test by heating to about 350°F and adjusting as needed to achieve steady burning.

#### Installation of LP/Propane Rating/Serial Plate
Record all relevant information from the existing rating/serial plate for compliance and safety monitoring.
