The TELE/WIDE settings have been activated. Additionally, NEAR/FAR and the Iris OPEN/CLOSE functions are also in operation. Each selection corresponds to a label indicated by white, yellow, or red symbols. The device can switch between Auto, Manual, and One-push modes while controlling the white balance. Initial settings can be adjusted by toggling between <RED> and <BLUE> options.

To activate specific functions, click the corresponding buttons for ON/OFF selections, including NTSC/PAL and USB/RS-232C options. Sound capture from the microphone is initiated through the first button click, with subsequent operations appearing on the interface.
