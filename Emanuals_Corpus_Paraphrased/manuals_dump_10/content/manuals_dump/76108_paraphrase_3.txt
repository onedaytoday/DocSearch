### Instructions for Technical Service and Appliance Operation

**Appliance Setup and Maintenance**

Ensure that the appliance is connected to the appropriate electrical supply as indicated in the specifications. If a moulded plug is used, it should conform to BS1362 and be certified by ASTA. If the appliance is sourced from a common outlet, it must be securely installed and comply with safety standards.

For appliances requiring a fused outlet, it is essential to connect them to a double-pole switch that complies with NICEIC and IEE regulations. Note that the term "double pole" indicates the switch can disconnect both the live and neutral lines.

**Wiring Guidelines**

Wiring should be color-coded as follows:
- **Brown**: Live
- **Blue**: Neutral
- **Green/Yellow**: Earth

For connections to heating appliances like room heaters or fireplaces, ensure compliance with national building regulations and seek necessary approvals from local authorities.

**Operational Efficiency**

To maintain performance, ensure that the exhaust is properly installed and does not obstruct airflow. Improper installation can lead to a decrease in efficiency and increased risk of overheating, which may pose fire hazards.

**Technical Specifications**

For optimal operation, the appliance should be used as specified, ensuring the cooking surfaces remain clear to prevent overheating. Always turn off the switches after use to minimize fire risks associated with grease build-up.

**Cleaning Recommendations**

Regularly clean the appliance to prevent the accumulation of grease. Internal components can be cleaned using suitable cleaners and brushes, and for deeper cleaning, a dishwasher can be utilized on the highest setting.

**Charcoal Filter Maintenance**

Replace the charcoal filter every few months, following the manufacturer's guidelines for cleaning and replacement. Ensure proper installation after cleaning to maintain efficiency.

**Light and Electrical Components**

When replacing light bulbs, ensure they are correctly fitted, and always disconnect power during maintenance. Follow the cleaning instructions carefully to prevent safety hazards.
