**10GN1/1 Chilling Process Overview**

The 10GN1/1 chilling system effectively reduces the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly minimizing bacterial growth during the cooling process. This transition must be completed within four hours, after which food can be maintained at -18°C for extended storage. The system supports diverse operational modes, including soft chilling at +2°C and shock chilling to +3°C or -18°C, continuously managing temperature for compliant food safety.

Equipped with built-in UV lights (as an accessory), the unit also includes defrosting capabilities and streamlined insertion methods. Users benefit from a countdown display and service notifications, while the chilling range extends to 32°C. The P1 phase achieves -14°C, and upon reaching this threshold, the system enters a temporary holding phase, transitioning to P2, wherein temperatures can drop to -36°C or even -40°C as needed. Operational data is logged, particularly concerning HACCP protocols, in cases of abnormal terminations.

**Technical Specifications**

The cooling system is capable of chilling food from +90°C to +3°C within a four-hour window, adhering to NF regulations and UK standards. Constructed from high-quality AISI stainless steel with polyurethane insulation, it ensures energy efficiency and compliance with environmental regulations (ISO certified). The built-in thermostat and thermometers are designed for precise control.

**Included Accessories**

- 3-sensor probe for the chiller and freezer
- Tray racks for BC+BCF with a capacity of 50 kg 
- Single sensor probes for efficient monitoring
- Remote unit options for chilling and freezing applications
- HACCP compliance kits, including specialized grids and slide-in racks
- Additional wheels and trolley for optimized mobility

**Installation and Maintenance**

The system is designed for easy installation, either plumbed or collected, and features HCFC-free insulation for environmental sustainability. It meets NF hygiene standards, certified by AFAQ AFNOR, ensuring reliable cleaning and thermal performance.
