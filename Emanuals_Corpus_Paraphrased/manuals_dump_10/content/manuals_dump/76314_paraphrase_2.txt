Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text while maintaining its original meaning:

The charts recommend that items should not be tightly packed during washing. For synthetic fabrics, it is important to follow specific wash settings. The categories for laundry include items like bathrobes, tablecloths, towels, cloths, and other stubborn fabrics, which should be treated with a freshening process overnight involving grease removal treatments. You can choose hot or cold water, depending on the fabric type, and use bleach for whites and colors, but it should be applied lightly.

Treatment for lipstick stains includes bleach application. For heavily soiled items, a prewash may be beneficial. The washing instructions indicate that cottons can be washed at 90°C or cold, based on the type, while economy options are also available for whites and colored items. Specific settings include options such as SPIN, RINSE HOLD, NO SPIN, NIGHT CYCLE, EASY IRON, EXTRA RINSE, and TIME MANAGER.

Synthetic shirts also require adherence to similar temperature guidelines, with special considerations for prewash phases if heavily soiled. Delicates, including acrylics and wool, should typically be washed at 40°C. Ensure that you follow detailed instructions for optimal performance and avoid overloading the machine. 

Regular maintenance is crucial for the machine's performance, including cleaning detergent compartments and the drum. If blockages occur, inspect hoses and remove any obstructions. 

For troubleshooting, keep an eye on warning indicators. Problems may include unclosed doors (E40 error), water supply issues (E10/E20 errors), or misalignment of the load distribution. Ensure proper operation, as well as activation of child locks as needed.

The technical parameters for water supply ratings are illustrated in a reference chart, focusing on optimal settings for washing various materials. Always ensure that hoses are correctly connected and maintained to prevent any functional issues.

When adjustments are necessary for laundry loads, redistribute heavier items manually to maintain balance and prevent mechanical strain on the washer. Using the correct cycle and settings can lead to improved cleaning efficiency and prolong the lifespan of your appliance.

**Water Alert!** This device is connected to the water supply. Secure the hose using the provided threading. Connect the hose from the previous unit to the new supply. Ensure the other end of the hose is positioned correctly based on the provided instructions, either to the left or right. If the hose is too short, consider purchasing a specific type designed for this application, or adjust to allow for a reasonable length to collect water effectively. 

When connecting the hose, make sure it is attached to a branch at least a few inches above the ground for optimal height and airflow. Proper ventilation is essential to maintain functionality.

Refer to the service documentation related to the hose's specifications and installation instructions, as it must adhere to safety ratings and grounding requirements. It's important to treat this device as household equipment. For recycling and disposal, consult on proper guidelines based on local regulations or where the product was purchased.

For any issues, reach out to customer service. If replacement is necessary, ensure to follow the given instructions for compatibility. Normally, the hose can be washed without pre-washing, but refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for specific care instructions.
