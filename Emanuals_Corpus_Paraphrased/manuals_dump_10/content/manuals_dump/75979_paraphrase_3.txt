### FROSTMATIC Function Overview

The FROSTMATIC feature operates to enhance freezing efficiency. When activated, the indicator lights will signal its operation. If you manually deactivate the FROSTMATIC function, it will turn off after a designated period. This countdown allows the system to briefly continue freezing before stopping.

To disable the FROSTMATIC, toggle the ON/OFF switch, which may require a few seconds for the change to take effect. Disconnecting from the power supply will also stop the function or the light indicators.

#### LONGFRESH 0°C Zone

This zone helps maintain food freshness by operating around 0°C with a controlled humidity level. It is ideal for storing fresh produce, ensuring they remain fresh longer while preventing spoilage. Adjust the shelf heights as required to accommodate various sizes of containers, optimizing storage space.

It is crucial to store items correctly, ensuring airflow around them. Foods should be covered or sealed properly to retain their quality and consistency. Some items, like seafood and certain vegetables, have specific storage durations in this zone:

- Onions: months
- Cooked meat: up to 3 months
- Peas, Celery: around 1 month

Ensure the food is appropriately stored to prevent unwanted spoilage or transfer of flavors.

#### Defrosting Tips

Defrosting should be managed carefully to maintain food quality. This process occurs within specified time frames to prevent any health risks associated with improper thawing. Warnings indicate that using tools not recommended in the manual or rapid heating methods could pose risks.

For safe defrosting, allow food to cool and switch off the appliance before cleaning, preventing electrical hazards. Regular cleaning is necessary to maintain optimal performance, and an appropriate cleaning routine must be followed to avoid damage.
