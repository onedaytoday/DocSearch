Always ensure that interlock systems are operational and that the cavity integrity is intact. If any components are damaged or show signs of wear, they should be repaired or replaced according to the procedures outlined herein. 

For servicing, ensure the microwave is disconnected from power. It is vital to discharge the high-voltage capacitor before proceeding with any repairs. Use an insulated screwdriver to short-circuit the capacitor to the chassis and ensure all wires are isolated prior to testing. 

**Microwave Measurement Procedure**

A. **Microwave Output Measurement**: Verify the microwave's performance against specifications using proper instrumentation.

B. **Testing Setup**: Ensure the microwave is operating normally and calibrate the cavity conditions to the required standards.

C. **Safety Protocols During Testing**: Avoid exposure to energized components, especially around switches and seams. Always measure continuity from the proper access points and ensure the microwave cavity is empty.

**Product Specification and Grounding Instructions**: Always ensure proper grounding and do not alter any safety features, such as removing ground pins from power plugs, to minimize electric shock risks.

This manual serves as a comprehensive guide for servicing the FMV156 series microwave ovens. Proper adherence to these guidelines is essential for safe operation and maintenance.

### Operation of Functions

#### OFF Condition
Closing the door activates the power switch and the secondary interlock switch. This action connects A.C. power to the system. The message "WELCOME, PRESS CLEAR AND PRESS CLOCK" will be displayed. To program the clock, first press the STOP/CLEAR button. Once cleared, a cooking display will appear upon touching the appropriate number before initiating cooking by pressing START. The following actions occur: relays close and connect, resulting in the activation of components.

With reference to relay connections:
- Relay RY: Turntable operation
- Relay RY2: Main relay
- Relay RY3: Component activation
- Relay RY4: High Voltage (H.V.) management 

Approximately high A.C. power flows through the microwave cavity, where food is heated. Once the cooking cycle is completed, the microwave power will cease, stopping any operation. The OFF condition is managed by the cook switch, interlock switch, and secondary interlock relay.

When the interlock switch and the secondary interlock relay are activated, it triggers cooling and high-voltage functions while the display shows cooking progress.

#### Operating Sequence Description
The sequence begins with the interlock switch. This switch and the secondary relays operate in conjunction: when closed, they start the operation cycle. If these are closed during operation, the relays will activate appropriately, ensuring safety. 

The power levels range from P-0 to P-90 during cooking. An ON/OFF duty cycle manages the microwave therapies for various periods, which are labeled from the highest setting (P-HI) to the lowest (P-0).

### Ventilation Methods
#### Hot Air Exhaust
**Vertical Venting:** Air is expelled through the top of the microwave, passing through grease filters, then ventilated to the outside.
**Horizontal Venting:** Similar to vertical venting but directs the airflow horizontally from the top.
**Re-Circulation (Inside Venting):** Air is filtered via grease ducts and charcoal filters, then redirected back into the kitchen.

### Circuitry Components
- Cavity Thermal Cutout: Protects against overheating.
- 20A Fuse: Provides circuit protection.
- Noise Filter: Minimizes electromagnetic interference.
- Control Unit: Manages operational commands.
- Bypass Capacitors: Offer additional insulation against electrical surges.

**Note:** Circuit configurations may change, and specific terminals must be connected appropriately for proper operation. Certain models incorporate an absolute humidity sensor.

### Schematic Overview
There are distinct schematics for various operating conditions, including cooking and off states, indicating the operational status of different components and switches based on door status and cooking programs.

### Component Functions
#### Door Mechanism
The door sensing and interlock switches ensure safety by preventing operation when the door is open. If these switches malfunction, the system may fail to close, which is critical for safety.

#### Thermal Cutouts
- **Hood Thermal Cutout:** Engages when temperature exceeds specified limits.
- **Cavity Thermal Cutout:** Prevents overheating within the microwave cavity during operation.

#### Fan Motors
- **Turntable Motor:** Facilitates even heating by rotating food.
- **Cooling Fan Motor:** Maintains optimal operating temperatures by directing airflow around heating elements.

### Troubleshooting Notes
During troubleshooting, ensure power is disconnected. Follow safety guidelines to isolate circuits and check fuses, switches, and relays. If components need replacement, refer to the specified assembly kits.
