### Operating Sequence Overview

**OFF CONDITION:** Closing the door activates the switch and secondary interlock switch, supplying AC power to the system. The display will show "WELCOME, PRESS CLEAR AND PRESS CLOCK." To set the clock, the STOP/CLEAR button must be pressed first to reset it. Once cleared, touching the NUMBER pad followed by START will initiate cooking. This sequence closes the relays and powers the connected components as follows: 

- **RELAY CONNECTED COMPONENTS:** 
  - Relay RY1
  - Relay RY2
  - Relay RY3 (Turntable)
  - Relay RY4

**COOKING CONDITION:** When cooking starts, AC power is supplied to operate the microwave, passing through the high-voltage connections to the magnetron, which feeds microwaves into the cavity where the food cooks. Cooking can be paused by activating the OFF condition, stopping the microwave operation.

**SWITCH OPERATION:** The interlock switches (both primary and secondary) are mechanically linked to ensure safety. When the door closes, the interlock switch engages. If this switch and the secondary interlock relay (RY2) are closed, power is allowed to flow. 

**COOKING POWER LEVELS:** The oven can be operated in various power levels, ranging from P-0 to P-90, where the ON/OFF cycle ratio dictates the cooking duration. 

### Ventilation Methods

- **Hot Air Exhaust (Vertical Venting):** Air is expelled from below through the grease filter and out of the top of the unit.
- **Ducted Horizontal Venting:** Air is directed horizontally from the top.
- **Re-Circulation (Inside Venting):** Air is circulated through the front while passing through a charcoal filter.

### Electrical Components

1. **Cavity Thermal Cutout:** Protects against overheating.
2. **Fuses and Filters:** Includes a 20A fuse, noise filter, and various capacitors for electrical suppression.
3. **Control Unit:** Contains critical control features and circuitry for various operations.

### Troubleshooting

When troubleshooting, ensure that the door sensing switch, primary and secondary interlock switches, and the monitor switch are functioning properly before replacing any blown fuses or components. It’s crucial to disconnect the power prior to any maintenance. Always verify that the supply cord is insulated and secure after testing.

### Additional Notes

- Circuit designs are subject to change.
- Certain models may include an absolute humidity sensor.
- Make sure connections are correct, especially those marked as needing to connect to neutral wires.
