### SANTO Combination Appliance Instructions

**Customer Operation Instructions**

Please adhere to these operating guidelines, which provide essential information for the appliance's use. Refer to this document when necessary. Important warnings and functionality notes are highlighted. For further clarification of technical terms, see the "Technical Terminology" section.

**Common Issues and Technical Support**

If you encounter any malfunctions, refer to the section "What to Do" for corrective actions. For assistance, please contact AEG Service Force or your local customer service.

**Appliance Operation**

- **Initial Setup**: Ensure the appliance is properly vented and located away from heat sources or direct sunlight.
- **Starting the Appliance**: Use the "COOLMATIC" and "FROSTMATIC" buttons to initiate cooling.
- **Managing Frost Buildup**: Regularly defrost the compartment to maintain efficiency.

**Safety Information**

Ensure the appliance is adequately earthed. The appliance must be disconnected from the power supply before any cleaning or maintenance. Only authorized service personnel should carry out repairs. Refer to local regulations for guidelines on proper disposal.

**Installation Guidelines**

The appliance should stand upright for a specific time before initial operation to allow coolant to settle. Ensure adequate clearance at the back and top for proper air circulation. For installation assistance, consult the relevant technical documentation.

**Control Panel Functions**

The control panel features indicators for actual and desired temperatures. Use the (WARMER) or (COLDER) buttons to adjust and set your preferred temperatures. The display will show the current status, including any warnings that may require immediate attention.

**Final Notes**

Before operating the appliance, ensure it is clean and serviced according to the guidelines. Always follow safety warnings and consult the instruction manual for any specific concerns related to your appliance's operation and maintenance.

**COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC Functions**

The COOLMATIC function is designed to cool fresh food effectively. When activated, a yellow indicator light will illuminate, signifying that the COOLMATIC mode is enabled for the desired period of hours. You can manually adjust the cooling settings based on your preferences. Additionally, the FROSTMATIC function specializes in rapidly freezing fresh food, ensuring optimal protection against spoilage. Similar to the COOLMATIC function, FROSTMATIC activates a yellow light to confirm its operation and can also be switched off manually after a designated time.

**Operating Procedures**

To turn off the appliance, hold down both ON/OFF buttons simultaneously for a few seconds until you see a countdown. Once the timer reaches zero, the appliance will power off. For proper defrosting, maintain food items in their sealed packaging to avoid contamination and spoilage. Keep in mind that food items should be spread out adequately for optimal cooling and arranged according to their size and density on the shelves.

**Temperature Monitoring**

Regular monitoring of internal temperatures is essential. Utilize a thermometer to verify cooling conditions, especially overnight. The recommended temperature for fresh meat products should be below C.

**Food Storage Protocols**

Ensure that fresh food is covered to prevent dehydration and contamination. Pay attention to the maximum storage capacities indicated for proper food management within the appliance, particularly when dealing with larger quantities. 

**Defrosting Guidance**

For effective defrosting, turn off the FROSTMATIC function and allow excess ice buildup to dissipate. Defrosting should occur once a layer of frost reaches a specific thickness. Turn off the power before attempting to clean or maintain the appliance.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Prior to cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply. Use appropriate cleaning products and avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals that may damage surfaces. Regular maintenance includes cleaning the appliance’s interior and exterior and inspecting the light fixtures for functionality.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**

In cases where operational issues occur, refer to the troubleshooting section. Should an error signal, such as a warning tone, persist, contact Service Force for expert assistance. Ensure that all doors are properly closed, as open compartments can affect performance and contribute to errors in temperature regulation.

**Safety Precautions**

Always prioritize safety while cleaning or servicing the unit. Follow manufacturer guidelines to prevent accidents or damage to the appliance.

Functionality: The lighting will turn off when there is frost on the water shelves. If normal sounds are absent, it may indicate a mechanical failure that requires AEG Service Force intervention.
