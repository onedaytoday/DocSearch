The system is designed to enhance performance and efficiency. These models, constructed with AISI materials, feature adjustable height for the base, top, and back, facilitating ease of access and optimized organization of interior space. Complete defrosting is straightforward, thanks to a high-performance design, which also ensures ease of cleaning through rounded internal corners that allow for seamless maintenance (without the need for cumbersome tools). 

The (+43Â°C) forced cooling system promotes uniform temperature distribution, and the high-density expanded polyurethane insulation, with cyclopentane injection, provides long-lasting thermal efficiency. The interior is designed for GN compatibility and includes self-closing doors for user convenience. A recessed design enhances usability, paired with a microswitch that deactivates the system when the door is opened, ensuring energy efficiency. Optional features include CFC and HCFC-free components.
