When installing the mount, it is crucial to ensure it is secured properly to avoid issues during operation (whether retracted or deployed) or under stress. The installation should follow the specified guidelines on www.elitescreens.com. 

The mounting location should be determined, and screws should be placed approximately one inch from the edge of the mount, aligned with the designated points on the back. Ensure the chains (included) are correctly attached to each mounting ear as outlined.

To operate the screen smoothly, take care when retracting or deploying. Itâ€™s also important to ensure the screen is clean, especially when housed, as recommended by the manufacturer. 

Referencing the dimensions and aspect ratio specifications for various screen models (like M71S, M136S, etc.) will help ensure the right fit. Note that all dimensions are given in inches and any discrepancies should be resolved using official specifications.
