Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a more concise and technical manner:

Wash fabrics overnight with a damp cloth to remove grease. For whites and colored fabrics, use bleach lightly. If treating with bleach, ensure thorough cleaning. For synthetics and wool, select appropriate wash programs. Use the steam function to reduce wrinkles, especially for synthetic shirts, or use the cold wash option for delicate items.

When manually redistributing items, utilize the extra rinse setting to ensure thorough cleaning. Follow recommended water levels and cycle times; for delicate fabrics, use selection options that minimize spinning.

For maintenance, regularly clean components such as the filter and drum to prevent issues. If any error codes appear, diagnose based on the displayed messages and follow appropriate actions, including checking for clogs or improper loading.

Ensure all connections, such as hoses, are secure and leak-free. If adjustments are needed, always power off the device beforehand. When setting up, make sure the washing machine is level and stable to prevent operational issues. 

Clean and maintain the machine according to user manuals, ensuring effective performance. Adjust programs based on fabric type, and monitor for any warning signals regarding operation or maintenance needs.

**Water Warning!** This is connected to the water supply. Ensure that the hose is properly threaded. Connect it to the previous supply hose as shown. Adjust the other end of the hose to face correctly—either straight or to the right—to ensure proper positioning. If the hose is too short, you may need to purchase a specialized hose to meet your requirements. Water can collect in the hose; therefore, use it only as intended and ensure it is tied securely to the branch. The hose should be at least elevated above the ground and well-ventilated for optimal performance.

For service information, refer to the rating plate. Ensure the system is properly grounded to avoid issues. This product should be treated as household waste and recycled appropriately. For further recycling information, contact local services or the retailer where the product was purchased. 

If supply needs to be replaced, follow the provided guidelines for proper handling. Typically, items can be washed without pre-treatment. Ensure that items are loaded correctly to maintain protection during the wash cycle, then proceed with washing.
