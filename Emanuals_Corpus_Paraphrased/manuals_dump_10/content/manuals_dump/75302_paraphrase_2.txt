The content above has been rephrased to maintain the original meaning while emphasizing clarity and technical accuracy.

Here’s a paraphrase of the given text in a natural, technical style while preserving the original meaning:

The yellow cable connects to the switch and should match the supply voltage reaching terminal C, which should be higher than the following types: H07 RN-F, H05 RN-F, H05 RR-F, H05 VV-F, H05 V2V2-F (T90), and H05 BB-F. This connection is primarily for single-phase applications. The operator must ensure that the built-in assembly functions correctly, providing essential protection against accidental contact with conductive parts, including insulation layers as well as any countermeasures.

The assembly can be mounted at an increased height or adjusted downwards as necessary, with a recessed design requiring four screws for secure installation. Safety protocols must be followed, including the disconnection of power when performing maintenance.

For warranty and customer service matters, the available services exist under the provisions outlined in Union Directive 99/44/EC. This legislation specifies customer rights, including coverage for defects occurring within the warranty period, usually spanning several months from the original purchase. Repairs are carried out free of charge, and customers must retain proof of purchase.

The warranty applies exclusively to defects stemming from manufacturing errors or materials and does not cover damage caused by improper operation or modifications. In the event of a defect, customers should notify the service center immediately, providing details about the product and the nature of the fault.

If the built-in appliance cannot be repaired due to damage sustained during installation or from unauthorized work, liability shifts away from the manufacturer. Any replacement appliance will be covered according to the warranty terms, and the customer should present any claims in line with the specified timelines.

For service queries or issues, consult the local service center according to the appliance type, providing necessary details like the model number and an accurate description of the problem. The warranty extends to the first point of sale, and customers should familiarize themselves with the terms of service specific to their country.
