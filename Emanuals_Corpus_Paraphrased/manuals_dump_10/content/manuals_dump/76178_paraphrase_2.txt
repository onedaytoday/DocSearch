The EI30HI55K dishwasher features easy cleaning capabilities, complemented by Luxury Design Lighting in the cooking area. It offers a choice between an integrated or remote blower option, along with various CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) configurations. 

For the 30-inch variant (EI30HI55K), you can select between integrated and remote blower options, with specific CFM ratings for each. The appliance operates on a 120V system and is equipped with a grounded service wire for safe operation. Installation instructions and specifications must be adhered to, and the blower should be connected according to the guidelines provided.

For best performance, ensure the blower is installed as specified—either as an integrated blower (models EI06HIPIKS or EI12HIPIKS) or a remote blower (models EI06HIPRKS or EI12HIPRKS)—with appropriate ductwork and height considerations. The blower system must comply with local building codes and may require custom installation based on specific kitchen configurations.

Please note that the company reserves the right to alter specifications without prior notice.
