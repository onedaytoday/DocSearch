**Lighting Instructions**  
To ignite the appliance, refer to the marking on the rating plate. Ensure that you are using the correct power supply and that the cooker is earthed properly to prevent electrical shock. If issues arise, check the power source and ensure that the cooker is correctly connected to the electrical supply.

**Cooking Procedures**  
When cooking, adjust the heat settings according to the type of food. Foods that require higher temperatures—like toast—should be cooked at 'HIGH,' while delicate items should be done on 'LOW.' It's crucial to turn and monitor food regularly to ensure even cooking.

**Shelf Configuration**  
Use the correct shelf height according to the cooking charts. The top shelf should only be used for suitable food items, and care must be taken to avoid obstructions that could restrict airflow. Follow recommended positions to allow heat to circulate properly.

**Roasting Guidelines**  
When roasting meats, ensure they are thawed thoroughly beforehand. Covering items during roasting can aid in even cooking. Use a meat thermometer to ensure safety and proper cooking temperatures are reached.

**Reheating Procedures**  
When reheating food, ensure it is done in a safe manner. Use the microwave or conventional cooking methods as appropriate and avoid reheating food multiple times.

**Timer Functionality**  
This appliance includes a timer feature, enabling users to set cooking durations accurately. If the appliance is turned off, the timer will reset. Follow the prompts to set the timer as needed.

By adhering to these instructions, users can enhance their cooking experience and ensure the safe operation of their appliance.
