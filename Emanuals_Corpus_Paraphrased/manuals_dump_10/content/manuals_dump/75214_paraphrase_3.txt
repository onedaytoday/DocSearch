**Instructions for Wholemeal White Pre-Heating:**

Select the desired cooking mode and set a higher temperature as recommended. This ensures that the cake is thoroughly baked. If the cake appears too light, lower the temperature. Next, switch off the heat and allow the cake to finish cooking. For apple cake or apple charlotte, preheat by selecting the appropriate function and setting a higher temperature, ensuring it reaches the designated shelf height.

When using the roasting or rotitherm function, utilize heat-resistant roasting dishes. If roasting directly (with or without other foods), ensure that the meat is appropriately sized and placed on a suitable shelf. Be cautious of meat drippings that could soil the oven. Refer to the roasting information guidelines for specifics on cooking times based on meat type and quantity. Adjust settings as needed to prevent burning.
