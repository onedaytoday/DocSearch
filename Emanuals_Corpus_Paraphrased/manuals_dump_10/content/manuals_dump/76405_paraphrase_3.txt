For any further queries, please refer to the relevant sections in the user manual specific to each feature.

To initiate the hourly countdown, press the corresponding button. If the chosen setting has expired, the display will indicate this, allowing you to PAUSE the cycle. Adjust the settings using the DRAIN option if needed. To modify your selections, turn off the machine, then restart it to access the updated options. Always ensure the DOOR is securely closed before operating; this is crucial if the machine is already heating or if the water temperature is excessively high. If it is necessary to stop the cycle, turn the power OFF before closing the DOOR.

During the process, the machine will automatically turn the indicator light off and emit an acoustic signal once the cycle is complete. If you selected a DRAINING or SPINNING option, follow the instructions provided to stop that function and reduce water usage. After the cycle is over, check that the DOOR is secure before turning the machine OFF to facilitate emptying.

For specific fabric types, refer to the settings for appropriate wash cycles:

- **COTTONS**: Typically offer options for 60°C or COLD washes.
- **SYNTHETICS**: Ideal for 30°C or 40°C cycles.
- **DELICATES and WOOL**: Utilize specific gentle cycles to avoid damage.

When sorting laundry, arrange items by color and fabric type, ensuring whites don't mix with colored clothing. This will maintain fabric integrity and cleansing efficiency. Use the specified charts for recommended wash temperatures, and if necessary, pre-treat any stains before washing.

To maintain the machine in good working condition, perform regular cleaning and checks, including the emptying hose and filter. Make sure to disconnect power before performing maintenance or cleaning tasks. If you encounter error signals, consult the manual for specific scenarios such as E10 or E20 errors, which indicate problems with water supply or tank issues.

Finally, ensure that child safety features are set correctly, and always double-check that the DOOR is closed before operation. Follow these instructions closely for proper operation and maintenance.
