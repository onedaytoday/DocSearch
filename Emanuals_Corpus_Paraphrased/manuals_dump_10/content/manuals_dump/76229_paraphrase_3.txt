### Transporting the Appliance: 

Ensure that when transporting the appliance, it is positioned upright at the front-right side. This should be done without altering the installation settings, especially concerning the plinth. Use a trolley to help maneuver the appliance out of the house. Connect the hoses correctly: make sure both the hoses and the connections to points labeled C and E are secure using screws. Once thatâ€™s complete, install the four screws (F and G) as necessary. 

If the location faces frost risk, ensure proper coverage to maintain warranty. Keep the area firm and free from grease. For installations on small-format bases, ensure the base is suitably mounted. When fixing the appliance, the base should be at least as thick as the designated foot for stability. The foot serves as a shock absorber, reinforcing the appliance's rear. Adjust the foot height as required by turning the screws.

 
### Safety Notice: 

WARNING: This appliance must be earth-connected. Ensure the electrical supply matches the indicated rating. The appliance comes equipped with cables identified as follows:

Each wire should be connected correctly to prevent any electrical hazards. The switch must be properly integrated with the electrical supply and is rated according to EEC directives. Ensure that repairs and connections are carried out by qualified personnel to avoid serious risks.

 
### Water Supply Hose:

Use the specified water hose with the appliance. If additional hoses are necessary, utilize those provided by Service Force, ensuring they feature the correct threaded ends. Properly position the water hoses to avoid kinks and ensure efficient flow. Maintain the hose height below the maximum specified to prevent malfunctions.
