### Paraphrased Text

When selecting laundry products, choose those suitable for both whites and colored fabrics. For cleaning, use non-biological detergents like Fairy, and avoid bleach with delicate fabrics or colored items. Opt for specially formulated laundry bleaches designed for specific fabric types. Whether you choose traditional powders or liquids, follow the instructions for dosage and application accurately, especially for compact versions. 

Fabric conditioners help reduce static and enhance freshness; use them according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Adjust settings on your washing machine based on load type—heavy items like whites and towels require different handling compared to lighter fabrics and synthetics. 

Ensure that washing temperatures and spin cycles are in line with EEC directives, especially at 60°C for non-colorfast items. Regular maintenance of your washing machine is crucial, which includes cleaning the detergent drawer and filters to prevent clogs. If you need to drain the machine manually, follow the proper procedures to avoid flooding.

In the case of malfunctioning or suboptimal performance, consult the troubleshooting guide for specific issues related to the machine's setup or load balance. Always maintain proper wiring connections and ensure the appropriate use of power supply specifications.

For any concerns regarding maintenance or repairs, contact Service Force for assistance. Ensure that your appliance is within the warranty period for any free repairs, adhering strictly to the provided guidelines and national standards.

When unpacking the unit, ensure that the hoses are not pinched, and detach the screws as needed. The polythene covering should be removed carefully, and the screws retained for reassembly. Set the unit upright and retrieve the three spacers that were fitted during packaging. Refer to the instructional manual provided for proper positioning of the components, ensuring nothing obstructs the hoses or any attached fittings.

The installation must be permanently connected to a water supply using the cold and hot hoses, which feature BSP threads. If adjustments are necessary, consult a plumber or a plumbing merchant to ensure compatibility with the existing supply. Ensure that the hoses are correctly placed to facilitate water flow.

First, install the U-shaped hose according to the guidelines, ensuring it is positioned internally and the top is correctly fitted. If further alterations are required, adjustments should be made to redirect the hoses accordingly. 

It is crucial that all hoses are securely connected to prevent leaks and to maintain the proper function of the washer-dryer or similar appliances. Locking mechanisms must be engaged during this process. Be cautious not to obstruct the area where the hoses are situated, as doing so could result in damage. 

Important: This appliance must be earthed properly. Power connections should match the specifications indicated on the rating plate found on the appliance. Use appropriate ASTA (BS1363/A) fixtures for connections. The wiring should correspond as follows: Earth should be connected to green/yellow, Neutral to blue, and Live to brown. Take care to avoid any stray wiring that could cause electrical issues.

For installation, ensure the appliance is built in according to the specifications shown. Prepare for assembly carefully to avoid trapping the hoses. The correct sequence of screws and components should follow the provided assembly guidelines. 

Adjust heights and fit other necessary parts securely. Ensure any mounting plates are properly aligned, and if reinverting plates is required, follow the same procedure. The front of the appliance must be secured adequately with countersunk screws for stability. 

Make adjustments to the height and secure it, ensuring that top clearance is maintained for optimal operation. Always ensure compliance with the outlined requirements to avoid future complications.
