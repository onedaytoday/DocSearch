Here’s a paraphrased version of the provided text:

To operate the microwave, follow the outlined steps fully. If you need to reset the clock after a power interruption, use the "STOP/CLEAR" and then "TOUCH CLOCK" options. Select either A.M. or P.M. as necessary. If an "ERROR" message appears during the clock setting, press "STOP/CLEAR" to correct it.

For cooking functions like popcorn, fresh food, or reheating, press "START" after selecting the desired options. To stop cooking temporarily, use the "STOP/CLEAR." For defrosting, consult the Defrost chart to manually select timer settings based on the food's weight, and press "START." Always cover foods adequately to prevent moisture loss, using microwave-safe coverings.

When reheating, it’s important to maintain proper covering and allow food to stand as necessary. Check for satisfactory heating, and be prepared to make adjustments. The charts will assist with varied food types and micro-cooking guidelines.

For specific foods, such as ground meat or fish, ensure they are covered and turned during cooking for even heat distribution. Also, adjust cooking times as indicated in the food charts, ensuring no overcooking occurs. 

Additional features include a Child Lock for safety and settings for audible alerts. The microwave can automatically switch cooking settings. Use the "HELP" feature for assistance if needed.

To change measurement units or languages, navigate the user interface accordingly. Cooking shortcuts such as "MORE" or "LESS" can adjust settings quickly. Each option must be confirmed with "START" to initiate the process.

### Operation Instructions

To operate the device, briefly press the on-off button, followed by the "STOP/CLEAR" button once to reset the count. The operational demonstration requires activating the clock, then selecting "START" to display three demonstration modes. The sequence will count down in seconds until it reaches the end, at which point you can reset by pressing "STOP/CLEAR." The device will provide user assistance through hints that illuminate while operational.

### Cleaning Instructions

To maintain cleanliness, use a damp cloth with a household cleaner that is safe for the microwave. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads. If the microwave interior becomes stained from food splatter, use a damp cloth only. Do not spray oven cleaners directly on any part of the microwave. This can interfere with the appliance's performance and potentially cause hazards, such as fire from overheated food. Ensure that the cover is kept clear to prevent obstruction from food splatters.

For cleaning the turntable, turntable support, and racks, ensure they are dishwasher safe. Avoid exposing them to high-acidity foods during cleaning. Allow the appliance to cool before cleaning.

### Service Information

For service, ensure the appliance is securely connected to a 120V AC power source. If any issues are noted post-purchase or during operation, please contact an authorized Electrolux service provider. The microwave should not be serviced by individuals without expertise.
