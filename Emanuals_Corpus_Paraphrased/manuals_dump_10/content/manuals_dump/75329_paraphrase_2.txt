### Revised Text:

The "OR" function operates in conjunction with coated light tins and shelf configurations, allowing items to be organized into three trays. Itâ€™s essential to arrange the trays with the most accessible items at the front of the shelf. Once foods have cooled, guidelines on cooking and dish selection can be reviewed. When cooking cakes, the temperature and duration may need to be adjusted based on whether you're using standard or elevated trays. Please switch off the heat as instructed to avoid burning or overcooking. 

The Cooking Table outlines recommended configurations, such as type and placement on Shelf C for various cakes like apple tarts or yeast bread. Preheating instructions must also be followed for optimal results.

For roasting, ensure the use of heat-resistant materials and adhere to cooking times specified in the guidelines. If marinated, meat should be positioned strategically to allow for even roasting. Turn off the heat as indicated to prevent overcooking.

The Roasting Table details thickness requirements for different meats and poultry. Items such as trout and poultry should be pre-heated appropriately on Shelf C.

The preserving function should be utilized with twist-off tops or sealable containers, ensuring they remain closed during the process. 

For drying, utilize greaseproof paper and allow food to cool thoroughly, preferably overnight. 

### Instructions for Cake and Dough Preparation:
1. **Cake**: Beat and blend ingredients into a smooth batter. Grease the baking tin before pouring the mixture.
2. **Dough**: Incorporate yeast with flour and other ingredients until a smooth dough forms. Grease before rising.

### Meat Preparation Instructions:
Minced meat should be browned with finely chopped onion and celery. Season appropriately and maintain heat while cooking through.
  
**Cleaning and Caution**: Ensure the appliance is turned off before cleaning, utilizing suitable cloths. Components must be maintained for optimal performance and longevity.
