- Right front: BTU value
- Left front: BTU value
- Left rear: BTU value

### Burner Setup and Adjustments

Ensure that each burner head is properly fitted. Each burner should produce a steady, clear flame that is blue, avoiding yellow-orange or irregular flames. For proper maintenance, regularly clean each burner head. In case the burners do not ignite, seek professional service.

### Cooking Utensils

Utilize flat and balanced cookware to match the quantity of food being prepared. Adjust the flame size based on the cooking needs for optimal performance. The type of cookware and amount of food will influence cooking times. If the flame is too low or too high, it affects cooking efficiency.

### Surface Cooking Controls

When adjusting surface controls for different cooking needs, be cautious of hot items that could catch fire. Always use pot holders when handling cookware and do not leave anything that can ignite near the heating surface.

### Griddle Use

The griddle is designed for cooking multiple food items and can withstand high temperatures. Be mindful when positioning pots or pans on it, and allow it to cool before cleaning to prevent burns.

### Warmer Oven Operations

The warmer oven is ideal for keeping pre-cooked food items heated. It’s recommended to cover food to maintain moisture. To operate the warmer, select the WARMER option, press START, and monitor the food temperature. Always keep children away from the warmer while it is in use.

### Baking Instructions

For baking, preheat the oven to desired temperature ranges from 170°F to 550°F. Use appropriate oven racks and allow space for heat circulation. Select the desired temperature, set your baking time, and monitor the oven to prevent overcooking.

### Broiling Techniques

Broiling requires high heat to achieve a well-cooked appearance. Set the oven between 300°F to 550°F and remember to preheat before introducing food. To ensure safety, never leave broiling food unattended, and avoid covering it while under the broiler.

### Convection Baking

Convection baking ensures even heat distribution. Preheat the oven as necessary and adjust cooking times based on food types and amounts. For optimal results, allow space for adequate air circulation around the food items. The convection setting can be adjusted for a range of 300°F to 550°F.

By consistently following these instructions and precautions, you can enhance your cooking experience while ensuring safety and efficiency.

**Cleaning the Hinge Slot:** Refer to the "Care and Cleaning of Stainless Steel" section to clean the hinge slot and improve the oven door’s appearance. To remove and replace the oven door, carefully apply pressure to the clips located at the front while rotating the top until it is fully detached. Follow the "Special Door Care Instructions" to avoid scratches or damage that may lead to increased wear.

**Oven Light:** The oven light is activated via a switch located near the shield. This shield must be cleaned manually and must remain in place whenever the oven is operational. **Caution:** Ensure the oven is cool before handling. Always wear leather gloves for protection when cleaning the shield, as it can heat up. 

**Broiler Pan Cleaning Tips:** Clean the broiler pan and its components promptly after use to prevent grease buildup. Avoid hot surfaces while cleaning. 

**Cleaning Burner Grates, Caps, and Heads:** Clean the grates, burner caps, and heads with appropriate tools; do not use abrasive materials that may scratch. These components can usually go in the dishwasher. Ensure spills do not enter the gas orifice holders. If cleaning disrupts the flow of gas, consult a qualified technician.

**Porcelain Enamel Cooktop Instructions:** To maintain health and safety, ensure that cleaning is conducted only when the cooking surface is turned off and cool. Avoid harsh cleaners that may react chemically. Allow surfaces to cool down before cleaning; use gentle methods for light stains.

**Preheating Guidelines:** For optimal results, preheat the oven for baking items such as bread or cakes. Avoid overcrowding or using excessively high temperatures, which can lead to uneven cooking. 

**Common Issues:** If the oven control beeps or displays an error code, use the cancel function, and consult an authorized service technician as needed. Ensure that all connections, including the power supply and clock settings, are secure after installation. 

**Self-Cleaning Cycle Issues:** If the self-cleaning function is unsuccessful, ensure the door is securely closed and follow the specific instructions. If excessive smoke occurs during broiling, adjust the meat's position for proper clearance and avoid covering it during the process.

**Flame and Heating Issues:** If flames are uneven or smoke is generated from the oven vent, inspect for high grease levels. If burners do not light or flames are only partially ignited, clean the components as specified in the cleaning instructions. Ensure cookware is of appropriate type and size for even heating.
