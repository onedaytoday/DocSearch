**Operation Overview**

The internal cooling operation is designed to effectively manage heat during cooking. This feature allows for the cooking of food indirectly, enhancing the overall functionality of the device. To engage the top cooking function, press the associated button in the cavity. The chosen setting will be confirmed after a few seconds. This process can reach temperatures up to 80°C. To deactivate the function, simply press it once. The control light indicates when the desired heat is achieved, followed by an acoustic signal indicating the completion of the operation.

The defrost function is intended for foods that require thawing before cooking, permitting the preparation of various dishes, even when the door is closed. This feature ensures proper cooking without compromising the integrity of the food. Examples of dishes that benefit from this include gratins and shepherd's pie.

**Shelf Management**

When placing shelves inside the cavity, ensure they are aligned straight and positioned towards the back for optimal operation. Take care to keep the front area clear. Safety precautions should be exercised, particularly around young children, to avoid accidents during cooking.

**Preheating**

Preheating is crucial for achieving desired cooking results. It is recommended to preheat the oven before cooking, especially for high-temperature meals. Cooking charts provide guidance for adjusting temperatures by approximately 20°C to 25°C for batch cooking to achieve the best results.

**Child Safety Features**

To activate the child safety lock, press the designated button, which will display "SAFE" to indicate successful engagement. To deactivate, press the button again. The lock prevents accidental use of the appliance and toggles off the lighter automatically if not in operation for extended periods.

**Cooking Charts**

Cooking charts detail appropriate temperatures and times for various foods, serving as a guide for achieving perfect results. Adjust cooking times based on the thickness of food items and shelf positioning within the oven.

By following these instructions and recommendations, users can optimize their cooking experience while ensuring safety and efficiency in operation.

**Paraphrased Text:**

When cooking, it is essential to preheat the oven to facilitate even heat distribution. Position food centrally on the designated shelf to ensure optimal cooking results. For larger items, ensure sufficient space around them to promote airflow and minimize cleanup. Adjust the shelf height to manage the browning level; higher shelves, particularly for dishes like Yorkshire puddings or cakes, allow for increased browning.

When defrosting, it’s advisable to do so at cooler temperatures, especially for delicate items such as thin meats, to ensure proper thawing without compromising quality. Always cook food immediately after defrosting and avoid leaving it at room temperature for extended periods.

If issues arise, such as uneven cooking, ensure the light indicator is functioning and check the shelf placement. For cleaning, allow surfaces to cool before disconnecting the power supply. Use only recommended cleaning agents to protect finishes, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage enamel or painted surfaces.

In the event of mechanical breakdowns, follow troubleshooting protocols outlined in the manual and consult a professional service if necessary. Proper maintenance and cleaning methods, including the manual washing of shelves, are vital for optimal performance. 

Ensure safety by keeping electrical connections secure and grounded, following relevant electrical directives, and adhering to local regulations. 

Regularly verify the condition of components and connections to maintain safe operation and adherence to technical standards.
