**STORAGE WATER HEATER INSTALLATION GUIDELINES**

This storage water heater comes equipped with the essential components, including the bushing and initial operating instructions. It is crucial to follow local regulations and guidelines for responsibility throughout the installation process.

**WALL MOUNTING PROCEDURE**

Use appropriate screws to securely attach the heater to the wall. 

**LOCATION**

Choose a location for the EWH-SL/SLN or EWH-R/RN models that is frost-free and within the house. Ensure that the installation allows for convenient access to the water outlet for servicing.

**HYDRAULIC INSTALLATION**

Connect the heater to the water supply correctly via the designated input. As water heats, it expands; therefore, the systems are designed to channel this expansion back into the cold-water line. For models RN and SLN, mechanisms are in place to prevent backflow of heated water. 

Adjust the outlet connections either clockwise or counterclockwise as needed. It is important to verify that the heater operates as intended after installation.

**ELECTRIC INSTALLATION**

The heater must have the proper phase connection to the power supply. Ensure compliance with electrical standards, as improper installation may lead to operational issues.

**PROHIBITED VOLUME**

Avoid installing switches or lighting fixtures within defined prohibited zones such as near bathtubs or showers to prevent electrical hazards.

**OPERATION**

The heater’s operational indicator will light up when it’s heating. The thermostat regulates temperature, allowing for settings between specified minimum and maximum limits.

**MAINTENANCE**

Regular maintenance should involve cleaning the heater with a soft cloth. The heater's warranty covers general use, but users should be aware that wear and tear can occur over time.

**SAFETY AND SERVICE WARNINGS**

Do not open the heater cover without disconnecting it from the power supply. The manufacturer reserves the right to modify product specifications. 

**TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS**

Each heater model has specific capacity, power ratings, heating times, and dimensions. Refer to the dimensional chart for detailed specifications.
