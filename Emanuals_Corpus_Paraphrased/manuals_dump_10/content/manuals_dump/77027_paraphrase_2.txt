**DBP Hardware Manual**

The DBP Hardware Manual provides instructions for using the amplifier. Please refer to the accompanying flow chart and follow the specified chapters relevant to your model and software. If you are using the DBP, relate your queries to the flow chart based on your configuration.

**Technical Specifications**

The DBP includes I/O input communication capabilities, specifically through RS485 and RS232 protocols, as well as features for battery performance and protective mounting of motherboards (MBA-DBP/3U and MBA-DBP/6U). The DBP is designed with robust circuit protection against shorts and overloads. 

**Control and Communication**

For motion control, the DBP accepts RS232 or RS485 commands, with features like battery-backed RAM for data integrity and high-speed input capabilities. The system supports a range of operational counts and has options for various input types. 

**Wiring and Connections**

The configurations for signal inputs and outputs include various digital output settings and limit switches for operational control. Ensure proper voltage levels for input signals to maintain functionality.

**Communication Specifications**

Communication with RS232 and RS485 requires adherence to specific parameters, including parity settings. The RS485 uses checksums for data integrity and must be connected correctly to avoid confusion in data transmission.

**Feedback Mechanisms**

The DBP operates on continuous feedback lines, allowing for real-time monitoring and adjustments. Users should activate specific features based on operational ratings.

**DCB Control Features**

The DCB facilitates command control of motion sequences, with capabilities for both continuous and discrete operation modes. These commands are integral to the amplifier's operation, ensuring precise monitoring of velocity and direction.

This comprehensive overview encapsulates the essential details of the DBP systems and their functionalities, aimed at ensuring effective usage and maintenance.

The connection of commands can be initiated through three primary methods: directly from the host or via user-defined inputs. The commands are designed to manage the motion of the system, allowing for the initiation or termination of movement based on specific criteria. The software subroutines control the motion, and termination can occur once stationary or when a defined endpoint is reached, either through a command from the host or activated via a switch.

Activation of a termination switch will immediately halt the motion, regardless of the system's current state. These commands prioritize safeguarding the machinery by ensuring an immediate stop whenever necessary. The internal mechanisms will only allow motion termination if factors like friction are accounted for.

Information received from the system includes various parameters such as velocity, and defined operational status codes sent to the Device Control Board (DCB) and the corresponding amplifier. The data relayed consists of metrics denoting the state of the system, like position and velocity, which support efficient processing and monitoring through high-level communication protocols.

Protection features for the DCB include safeguards against short circuits and output overloads. The system inhibits operation if voltage conditions fall outside preset limits. For instance, operation will cease if the supply drops below 13V or when feedback from the internal components detects lower levels than required. Battery voltage conditions are also monitored to maintain optimal system integrity.

The block diagrams illustrated outline the communication protocols and pathways within the system, emphasizing current feedback mechanisms, protective circuits, and operational inputs/outputs. These components work in concert to ensure precise control over movement and efficient response to command signals, whether in a velocity or current mode.

The mounting and power distribution setups for the various versions of the Device Board Power (DBP) are also specified. This includes details on connector types, power phase arrangements, and how components interact within the system architecture. Proper connection and activation of inputs are critical for functional operation, ensuring that various voltage levels and directional commands are correctly interpreted for system responsiveness.

**Inductance Specifications**

The inductance for the DC supply of each phase (Ir) should conform to the following specifications. When using an AC supply, technical standards must be adhered to, including recommended inductance values for each phase. In general, it is advisable for the AC phase supply to be rated higher than 20A, typically in the range of 135V to 270V for the 3U amplifiers.

**Wiring Guidelines**

Connect the wires from the DBP MC Chassis together, ensuring they are twisted and shielded. Pay attention to the grounding setup: for non-isolated AC chassis, connect directly to a three-phase source. The amplifier's ground will be created if grounded properly. For isolated configurations, the DC chassis should be grounded similarly, ensuring the amplifier's connection is secure.

**Additional Notes on DC Power**

DC power terminals must be connected if a single-phase configuration is employed or if an increase in shunt current is necessary. When using more than one DBP, direct connections to the three-phase mains are required.

**External Shunt Resistor Connection**

For connecting an external shunt resistor, follow the guidelines outlined for DBP connections, ensuring configurations adhere to the specified voltage and current capacities.

**Communication Protocols**

For Hall sensors and communication protocols such as RS232 and RS485, itâ€™s essential to connect shielding only at the computer end to prevent interference. Use twisted pair shielding for signals, ensuring proper connections are made at both ends for reliable communication.

**Encoder Connections**

Differential encoder connections should be made ensuring that the supply voltage matches the encoder's requirements, either +5V or +15V. Shielding must be correctly grounded to the J1 or J6 connection points or the respective frames.

**Settings and Procedures**

In operational procedures, select the appropriate DIP switch settings based on the specification sheets. Reference voltages and feedback configurations must align with factory OEM settings for optimal performance. 

**Performance Verification**

After installation, verify that signal LEDs indicate "ON" status. If errors occur, consult the troubleshooting guide and ensure all connections are securely made. The DCB should read "Communication OK" for proper functionality. Make sure to clear any error codes as specified in the operational manual. 

For any adjustments necessary during operation or if issues arise, refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for corrective actions.

**Instruction Overview:**

A) This instruction details the internal protective functions of the Latch Model (LM0) and the inhibited state of Latch Model 1 (LM1). For each function, clearing is performed by either applying the input (H/R-17a, E-J3/21) or turning off the device. It's recommended to operate in LATCH MODE (LM1). Connect leads appropriately and deactivate the feedback during operation. Should feedback be required, it must be correctly managed via the leads, along with the immediate input to the DCB RAM.

The DIP switch settings to manage baud rates and system status indicators are as follows: ON/OFF statuses for various components, including battery status and output voltage. It's essential to observe the DIP switch configurations carefully for proper auto-selection and input management.

Concerning circuit configurations, inductance and resistances (C1, R4, and R7) need to be aligned correctly to the amplifier input. If utilizing option DS11, ensure that it is set to OFF and apply the BA command while using a +2.0V waveform as necessary.

For overall system performance, ensure the critical parameters are satisfied, specifically regarding velocity feedback and waveform stability. Repetitive adjustments may be necessary, particularly surrounding the shorting of components C1 and R4.
