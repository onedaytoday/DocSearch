**Technical Paraphrase:**

The complete defrosting process depends on the type of frost present. During operation, without proper defrosting, frost can accumulate, affecting both the internal system and the stored food. To address this, follow these steps: 

1. Turn off the appliance using the appropriate switch.
2. Disconnect it from the electrical supply.
3. Empty the contents and clean the interior thoroughly before restocking with fresh food.

If any issues arise, consult the accompanying chart for guidance on servicing and operation, as sounds may indicate specific problems. 

Ensure that cushion spacers are properly positioned at the back of the unit. If the light is flashing, it may indicate that the door is not closed correctly or that the appliance is experiencing frequent temperature issues.

Excessive frost accumulation can suggest that food items are placed too closely together or that the unit is too cold. It’s critical to keep food at a safe distance from each other and monitor temperatures closely. 

When servicing, ensure that the electrical supply is correctly connected. If you notice any faults, such as flashing indicators or insufficient cooling, disconnect the appliance and perform necessary troubleshooting as per the instructions.

Always change the water supply connection as needed, ensuring that hoses are intact and tightly secured. If any issues arise in the initial setup or operations, address them accordingly to avoid future complications.

For proper appliance performance, it's essential to adhere to the positioning guidelines specified on the rating plate (QT3619FX, QT3619K, QT3549W, QT3549FX, QT3549K). Maintain ambient temperatures within the recommended ranges. 

If the appliance needs to be earthed, consult with a qualified electrician to ensure compliance with E.E.C. directives.
