### Cooking Instructions for Ready Meals

**Oven Functions: Cooking and Roasting**

Utilize the convection heating and roasting functions of your oven, ensuring that you refer to the provided guidelines for proper use. Place the food directly on the roasting shelf or below for optimal results. Monitor cooking times to prevent overcooking or burning. For heavy items, check periodically to adjust heat as needed.

**Oven Settings for Various Meats and Poultry**

Different meat types and portions may require unique temperature and thickness adjustments. For poultry, the recommended temperatures and roasting times vary based on whether the food is whole or cut into pieces. Always preheat your oven adequately before cooking.

**Defrosting and Drying Functions**

Use the defrost function to thaw food on a shelf, covering it with a plate if necessary. For optimal results, avoid placing frosted items in direct contact during defrosting. The drying function allows food to cool overnight, usually at a set temperature to preserve freshness.

**Preservation Techniques**

When using the preserve function, ensure jars are filled appropriately without touching each other. The initial temperature should be carefully regulated to achieve desired consistency. Once cooking is complete, the temperature may be reduced to maintain preserves successfully.

### Cleaning Guidelines

When removing racks or components, follow the designated steps to avoid scratches or damages. Be cautious when handling fragile parts and ensure secure reattachment after cleaning.
