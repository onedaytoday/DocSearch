In order to set up the TV (DVB-S model) equipped with a Conditional Access Module (CI CAM), please ensure you have the software and PDF CD-ROM ready for installation. Connect the LNB to the appropriate input on the device, ensuring compatibility with a Mac. Plug the device into an AC power source, and connect the DC output to the DC-12V input as provided in the documentation.

After unpacking, follow the software installation instructions detailed in the PDF. Use RG-6 cable to connect the LNB to the ANT IN port on the TV. The device is designed to automatically configure itself; simply adhere to the on-screen prompts during setup. If you need to purchase a CAM or subscribe to a service, complete this step as prompted.

To begin recording and accessing the Electronic Program Guide (EPG), follow the instructions after the device powers on. If switching between different service types is necessary, refer to the user manual for guidance on how to select the appropriate options. Once software installation is complete, you can access additional applications through the CD-ROM.
