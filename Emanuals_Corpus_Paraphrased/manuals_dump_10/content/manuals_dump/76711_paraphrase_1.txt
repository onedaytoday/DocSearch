For detailed adjustments, access the GUI by pressing "HOME MENU," select "Advanced MCACC," and follow the on-screen instructions, ensuring to handle the microphone and speaker setup correctly to optimize results.

### Advanced MCACC Overview

The Advanced MCACC system allows users to optimize audio performance through several procedures. First, select the desired mode and then access the MCACC settings. It is recommended to choose the "ALL" option to utilize all available features, including the Equalizer (EQ) when the MCACC EQ S-Wave is enabled.

You have three correction types to store in the MCACC memory. Each correction aligns left and right channel characteristics. For front channels, select "FRONT ALIGN" to ensure synchronization with the front speakers, and choose "YES" for THX settings or "NO" for standard configurations. The S-Wave feature analyzes reference tones to achieve balanced audio seating.

Ensure that the microphone is placed in an appropriate spot as indicated on-screen. Select "ALL" or "SP" based on your system's characteristics. Use USB memory to save separate SYMMETRY settings and other measurements. Advanced users may opt for Professional EQ options based on their acoustic environment.

While conducting these operations, the MCACC will display tones on-screen, which you should follow by pressing the "START" button to continue. Should any issues arise (e.g., error messages), revisit previous selections and make necessary adjustments. If the Phase is displayed as inverted, check that all connections are secure.

### Acoustic EQ Implementation

To optimize surround sound performance, users can manually adjust the Acoustic EQ settings. Ensure that the tones match the reference sounds, making necessary alterations as needed. Each adjustment aligns with the specified reference, allowing for nuanced corrections.

Monitor the acoustic performance by applying the Advanced MCACC Wave options. This includes setting trims for the main channels or subwoofer. As you finalize the setup, be cautious of drastic adjustments that might lead to an imbalanced auditory experience. 

If the MCACC function detects any discrepancies, such as surrounding sound issues, it will provide troubleshooting information. You may toggle between EQ settings to observe their effects on sound propagation.

When using the MCACC function, potential characteristics will showcase real-time adjustments. Comparing predicted and actual sound profiles helps refine acoustics effectively. After completing adjustments, don’t forget to save your settings, ensuring you can revert or fine-tune as necessary in future uses.

### Advanced MCACC Functionality

#### Checking MCACC

To automatically perform MCACC (Multi-Channel Acoustic Calibration System), access the GUI (Graphical User Interface) by pressing the HOME MENU on your TV. From there, press ENTER to navigate through the menu items. Use the RETURN button to go back to the RECEIVER options.

Select "MCACC" from the available options, which include various configurations (e.g., Wave, Acoustic EQ), each with specific settings that can be adjusted. To repeat the MCACC process or navigate to different functions once completed, press RETURN.

#### Input Selection and Surround Sound Configuration

Navigate through different input selections and configurations using the HOME MENU. To set up the surround back terminals, select the SP option corresponding to your connection type (e.g., HDMI). 

Ensure that your system is configured to ensure optimal surround sound performance. You can customize playback depending on whether you are using height channels or standard surround configurations.

Be cautious when adjusting settings to prevent any mismatch in bass management across speakers. Selecting SMALL or LARGE options will determine how the bass is routed—either to the subwoofer or to specific front speakers. 

For systems equipped with THX capabilities, adhere to the specifications for speaker sizes to optimize overall sound performance. Follow prompts in the GUI for a successful setup.

Certainly! Here’s a paraphrased version of your text in a natural, technical manner while retaining the original meaning:

---

Select “LARGE” for surround sound bass and “SMALL” for other sounds. If you're choosing surround options, you can select “NO” for surround back or adjust bass settings accordingly. Set the subwoofer option to “NO SW” if you have selected “NO” for the surround back. When “YES” is chosen, the bass capacity can be shifted from the front speakers to the subwoofer. If you choose “PLUS,” the subwoofer will continuously receive bass sounds that would typically be routed to the front speakers. If you select “NO,” bass will be directed from other channels, and you can choose "X" to complete the configuration. 

Use the manual settings to adjust tones across different zones if necessary. If you select the surround back option as “NO,” bass will be handled differently, possibly affecting overall sound output. The system accounts for the different bass outputs to ensure each is correctly balanced based on the selected configuration. 

In instances where THX settings are enabled, you have the option to toggle various THX processing features, including SB THX Select2 and Boundary Compensation. Confirm your settings for the best sound experience, and adjust audio tones either automatically or manually as required. Use the on-screen menu for easy navigation and selection of different sound options and network configurations.

For network settings, ensure your device is properly connected, either using DHCP or static IP configurations. As you adjust settings for IP addresses, DNS servers, or proxy fields, follow the manual’s prompts carefully to ensure successful connectivity.

Whenever you make adjustments related to HDMI settings or Bluetooth functionality, confirm the settings using the on-screen indicators. The receiver allows customizable controls over volume and sound enhancement features, providing options to mute or adjust sound levels easily. 

When positioning speakers, maintain symmetry to optimize audio output in your home. Ideally, speakers and subwoofers should be spaced a minimum of several inches from walls for optimal sound reproduction. Proper calibration via the MCACC function will help mitigate sound reflections and enhance acoustics.

Testing has shown that appropriate positioning results in better sound dispersion, ensuring that both surround and front speakers work harmoniously. Employing the MCACC for fine-tuning sound levels can significantly improve audio quality and overall listening experience.
