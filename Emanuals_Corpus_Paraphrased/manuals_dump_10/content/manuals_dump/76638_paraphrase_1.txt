### Navigation Warnings and Safety Information

The navigation system provides essential warnings and safety information that rely on the attached GPS. If the vehicle changes location, the GPS will transmit pertinent information. It is crucial to plan your route prior to departure and pull over to adjust route parameters if necessary. We highly recommend activating the safety mode unless passengers are the sole operators of the system.

The interface is designed for user-friendly guidance while the vehicle is in motion, providing directions and instruction to facilitate easy navigation. Users can access different functions through direct touch selections, which can be graphically represented on the display with accompanying arrows.

Users can initiate selections by touching the screen directly, and selected options will take effect instantly. Depending on the current display, this interface allows for modifications to route parameters and the selection of features. The function status (enabled or disabled) is clearly indicated, with visual cues for active switches.

For text input, users can select between various keyboard layouts such as ABC or QWERTY, which accommodate both letters and numbers. Switching between layouts can be done by repeatedly pressing the respective button. The device supports various languages, and users can input text using alternative keyboards tailored to specific languages.

The navigation system operates in both 2D and 3D perspectives, adjustable via a specific button. NOTE: The 2D North-up view is beneficial for clarity, while the 3D Track-up view can enhance spatial awareness. Each view can be adjusted based on user preference or situational needs, with prompts available for ease of transition.

Brightness settings can also be altered to suit daytime or nighttime conditions, with options for automatic adjustments based on the environment. Users have the flexibility to enhance visibility in varying light conditions.

Lastly, the GPS offers a Lock-On-Road feature that indicates real-time vehicle positioning on the road. This arrow guidance is crucial in navigating one-way streets and ensuring accurate localization according to the road layout. If deactivated, the system will display standard positioning without the directional assistance.

Here's a more concise and technical paraphrase of your text:

The Lock-on-Road function facilitates selecting a chosen item using the cursor, enabling permanent selection whenever a point of interest (POI) is highlighted in 3D backgrounds. When GPS and Lock-to-Position are activated, the cursor is represented by an arrow. Selected items and their GPS coordinates are displayed alongside historic navigation data. To mark the current location instantly, press the Record button, which will save it to the Navigation History list.

This system includes thousands of built-in POIs, with options to create and manage them. If multiple POIs are too close together, they may be displayed as a single item. Inactive route sections will appear differently when compared to active sections, which guide the user along the currently navigated path. Users can choose whether to display nearby POIs based on the active route.

The Cockpit screen provides an overview of navigation, including turn indications and route details. The display can switch between 2D North-up and 3D Track-up modes, allowing users to navigate intuitively. The GPS quality is indicated, and audio alerts can be adjusted based on preferences.

Track recording and playback are integral, letting users revisit routes or specific locations easily. When adjustments are made to the cursor or GPS settings, the system automatically recalibrates. The relevant information appears as the user interacts with the interface, guiding them effectively throughout their navigation experience.

### Navigation Options Overview

The navigation system provides several features for users. It enables options for turn notifications, including indications for upcoming turns, such as intersections and roundabouts, which are displayed as you approach them. The "Next Turn" feature is visible when nearing these turns. 

There are two display modes: 2D and 3D, with both options available to enhance route visualization. Information about the route is presented continuously on the screen while navigating, detailing aspects related to your destination. This feedback system includes arrows indicating direction and distance, adjusting dynamically as you progress along the route. Conditionally formatted colors help differentiate various components of the route, which includes recommendations for preferred roads.

When choosing your route—whether for a car or truck—you can specify the desired criteria, such as the shortest or most suitable route for emergency scenarios. The system considers various factors, including estimated time of arrival (ETA), to optimize the route accordingly.

Warning notifications are displayed for significant changes or alerts regarding your navigation. The interface includes features that let you access built-in Points of Interest (POI), showcasing them on your route. Users can browse through these POI items, filter by distance or category, and manage their POI lists easily.

Tracks can be recorded and displayed as necessary, with options for starting or stopping the recording process directly via the interface. Users can also highlight specific tracks or POIs, providing convenience during navigation.

Additionally, the itinerary function allows users to manage multiple waypoints. Each item in the itinerary is equipped with relevant pictograms and information, facilitating smoother transitions through navigation steps. 

Overall, the navigation system is designed to give clear and contextual instructions, enhancing the driving experience, and making route management intuitive.
