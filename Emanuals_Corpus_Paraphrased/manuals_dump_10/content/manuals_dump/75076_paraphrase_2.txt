**Convection Cooking Instructions**

To begin convection cooking, press the START button. This method enhances cooking efficiency for recommended items, particularly meats. For defrosting, press the defrost button followed by START. Consult the Defrost Chart for food types and quantities, or input the weight manually. Ensure food is suitable for microwave use and adequately covered during defrosting to prevent drying.

Maintain moisture by covering food with a cloth or towel, and follow the cooking guidelines provided in the microwave cookbook. If cooking is interrupted, use the STOP/CLEAR button to restart manually. Error messages may appear if cooking parameters are exceeded; review the user manual for troubleshooting tips.

For optimal heating, ensure food is covered loosely to allow steam to escape—especially important for items like popcorn. Adjustments may be necessary based on the food’s weight and type when reheating or cooking.

Specific guidelines for different food types, such as fresh vegetables or ground meat, include particular cooking times and covering instructions. Always follow the recommended temperatures and cooking times to achieve the desired doneness and avoid overcooking.

To preheat, touch the START button, ensuring the oven temperature is set appropriately for the food being prepared. Consistent monitoring and adjustments will help maintain the quality of dishes being cooked or reheated.

For certain items, such as cakes or casseroles, follow the thickness and texture guidelines for best results. 

In summary, always consult cooking charts and guidelines for effective use of the convection microwave, and remember to utilize the preheat function as needed.

### Convection and Cooking Guidelines

**Overview of Convection Cooking:**
Convection cooking utilizes both heat and moisture for efficient food preparation, with temperature settings ranging from 100°F to 450°F. Optimal cooking temperatures for various foods include High (300°F to 325°F) for meats and textured breads. To start, select High and preheat to 375°F or touch the preheat function for settings at 350°F or 325°F, depending on the food being prepared.

**Microwave Cooking Procedures:**
To initiate cooking, touch START. The microwave will notify you once it has preheated with a sound alert, indicating the selected temperature has been reached. It's important to follow the cooking and preheating instructions carefully.

**Using the Defrost Function:**
For defrosting, consult the Defrost Chart for specific types of food. Items such as steaks and chops should be shielded and rearranged periodically during defrosting to ensure even thawing. If using the Defrost operation, thawed foods should be covered to prevent ice crystals from forming. 

**Child Lock Feature:**
To activate the Child Lock, touch the designated buttons until LOCK ON appears. To release, follow the same procedure. This feature ensures that the microwave settings cannot be altered without your permission.

The microwave supports multiple languages and measurement units (e.g., pounds and kilograms). You can select your preferred option via the settings menu.

**Cleaning Instructions:**
For upkeep, clean the microwave with a soft cloth using a non-abrasive cleaner. Avoid using harsh chemicals or scouring pads on any surfaces.
