The charts recommend that textiles should not be overly compressed. For synthetic materials, it’s crucial to minimize their usage beyond one-third of the load capacity to achieve optimal performance. The following instructions apply to various items: bathrobes, tablecloths, towels, and other stubborn textiles. It is advisable to freshen them by soaking overnight and then washing with appropriate detergent. Utilize cold or warm water, and only use bleach with whites and colors separately. For stain removal, treat fabrics with bleach as required, ensuring thorough cleaning after the initial treatment.

Specific washing programs for cottons include settings for economy and prewash modes, suitable for items with varying washing requirements. Synthetic fabrics should be washed at temperatures between 60°C and cold, with options available for prewashing and economy cycles as needed. Delicate fabrics, including acrylics, require a specific 40°C prewash cycle. 

Each wash program includes features such as spin, rinse hold, night cycle, easy iron, and additional rinse options. Manual redistribution of items may be necessary, especially for those labeled for hand wash or delicate treatment. Specific options for soaking and washing jeans are designed for their care.

When following these instructions, ensure all compartments, including compartments for cleaning products, are properly maintained to avoid operational issues. Deterge and clean these sections regularly to maintain machine efficiency.

In the event of malfunction or an error code appearing (like E10, E20, or E40), check the relevant hoses and connections for blockages or improper arrangements. Activation of safety features should also be confirmed. If you experience unsatisfactory performance, refer to troubleshooting procedures.

Technical height, load ratings, and water supply guidelines should be documented accurately, and it’s imperative to follow specified instructions regarding installation and operational adjustments for safety and efficiency.
