To begin, ensure that the heating switch is turned off. Proceed by switching on the oven and setting it to the desired cooking temperature, typically between 150°C and 200°C. Preheating the oven is essential for recipes like Shortcrust pastry, which may require specific adjustments based on the type and amount of ingredients used. For optimal cooking results, place food evenly on trays or in containers. For roasting meats, temperatures of 200°C to 250°C are recommended, while poultry should be cooked at a lower range of 150°C to 175°C. It's crucial to monitor cooking times precisely to ensure that the meat is adequately cooked; if it feels firm to the touch, it may be done. 

Different types of dishes require specific temperatures—cakes and pastries like shortbread or fruit cakes typically need preheating at specified temperatures. Similarly, breads and pizzas should be baked at designated settings to achieve the best texture and flavor. 

For cleaning the oven, always let it cool down first before switching it off and disconnecting from the power supply. Regular cleaning operations should be done using appropriate non-abrasive cleaners to prevent damage to surfaces. The oven cavity should be cleaned after each use, particularly when it reaches high temperatures, to avoid burning food residues. If the cleaning function (P I) is needed, it can be activated easily. Ensure that no items are left inside while using this function.

To clean the oven efficiently, remove removable parts first, clean each surface thoroughly with suitable cloths, and ensure all elements are reassembled correctly with attention to detail. If any components are scratched or damaged, replace them immediately to maintain safety. 

In case there are issues with the appliance, check to ensure it is receiving power and that settings are correctly configured. If problems persist, consult the customer service department for assistance.
