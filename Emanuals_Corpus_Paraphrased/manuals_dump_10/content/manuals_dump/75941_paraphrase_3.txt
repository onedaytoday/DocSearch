**Initial Setup**

To prepare the appliance for use, ensure it's upright, give it several hours to stabilize before operating, and follow the detailed setup in the section: "Initial Operation."

### Defrosting Guidelines

To defrost the appliance, ensure it is turned off. The frost that accumulates will melt and drain from the base. Before cleaning, **disconnect from the electricity supply**. Use appropriate cleaning agents that do not contain bleach to clean both inside and outside of the appliance thoroughly.

**Caution:** Avoid using aggressive cleaning products, as these can damage the appliance and affect its cooling efficiency. If the drain outlet becomes blocked, clear it to prevent further issues.

### Lighting Safety

Before performing any maintenance, **turn off the light switch** to avoid electric shock. The specifications for the light are voltage (V) and wattage (W). To purchase replacement parts, contact AEG Service Force.

To replace the light bulb, unscrew the head and remove the light cover.

### Operational Symptoms

If the light remains continuously on or if you hear unusual sounds, it may indicate frost buildup or an obstruction. Check that the light switch is properly functioning and ensure food is stored correctly to maintain airtight seals.

### Water Leaks

In the event of a water leak, immediately contact AEG Service Force, as this may indicate a mechanical failure. Ensure compliance with all relevant safety regulations, including GSG, VBG, and VDE standards.

### Cooling System Overview

Cooling operates by transferring heat from the food to the surrounding environment. The heat exchanger is typically located at the back of the unit and should be kept clear to allow for proper airflow.

### Warranty Conditions

The warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship for the first purchaser for a specified period. Unauthorized repairs or modifications may void this coverage. For repairs, promptly contact the service office or an authorized AEG service technician.
