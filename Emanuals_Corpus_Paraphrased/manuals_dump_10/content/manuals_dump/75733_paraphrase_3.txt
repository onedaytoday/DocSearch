**Operating Modes of the Appliance**

The appliance operates in various modes, as follows:

- **SHOPPING Mode**: Designed for cooling the section for a specific number of hours (C hours).
  
- **FROSTMATIC Mode**: Activates cooling in the section for a set duration.
  
- **COOLMATIC Mode**: Functions for C hours.
  
- **FROSTMATIC and COOLMATIC Mode**: Engages both cooling modes for the specified duration.
  
- **HOLIDAY Mode**: Operates for C hours, maintaining normal conditions.

To initiate operation, press the MODE button once. The SHOPPING mode will flash. If it doesn't switch after a few seconds, rapidly pressing the MODE button will change the operation. The currently active mode (SHOPPING, FROSTMATIC, COOLMATIC, or HOLIDAY) is displayed. A DOOR OPEN warning appears if the door remains ajar, and a HIGH TEMPERATURE alert arises if the conditions exceed safe levels. A SERVICE error message indicates a malfunction.

**Initial Setup and Cleaning**  
To set up the appliance, ensure it stands upright for a specified number of hours before operation, allowing proper cooling. Cleaning should follow the "Installation" guidelines. Confirm that the temperature is set to the correct rating.

When first powered on, the appliance will flash a red light and emit a sound if it detects a warning, with readings displayed for the sections. Resetting any warnings can be done by switching off the appliance.

**Operation Explanation for Modes**  
- In **SHOPPING Mode**, food cooling is enhanced, particularly for perishable items, operating for up to C hours.
  
- **FROSTMATIC Mode** preserves fresh food products by ensuring efficient cooling.
  
- **COOLMATIC Mode** activates cooling for specific foods.
  
- When combining **FROSTMATIC and COOLMATIC**, both modes work simultaneously for optimum cooling.

**HOLIDAY Mode Summary**  
This mode is designed for periods of absence, maintaining a low energy state to prevent spoilage. Activation requires repeated pressing of the MODE button until the HOLIDAY indicator flashes.

**Switching Off the Appliance**  
To turn off the appliance or specific sections, hold the appropriate button until a countdown confirms the action. Once completed, the appliance will shut down, and all displays will reset.

**Warning Indicators**  
In case of function alerts like "DOOR OPEN" or temperature warnings, lights will flash, and acoustic signals will sound until the issue is resolved. Food safety must be monitored during alerts, ensuring that no thawing or overheating occurs.

For technical issues, the SERVICE indicator will flash, signaling the need for customer support.

Ensure correct operation by regular servicing and adherence to operational protocols to avoid malfunctions or food spoilage.

**LONGFRESH C Overview**

The LONGFRESH C features adjustable shelving that optimizes height for various storage needs. It is designed to maintain the freshness of food while minimizing moisture loss. When compared to conventional fresh food storage, the LONGFRESH C preserves higher food quality and nutrient retention.

**Food Storage Guidelines**

Items placed in the LONGFRESH C should be appropriately defrosted before use. It is essential to follow instructions for effective cooling and storage in designated sections, particularly for fresh produce and dry items. The system includes multiple accessories to accommodate different food types and their specific cooling requirements.

**Cooling Efficiency**

To ensure optimal cooling of bottles and food, the COOLMATIC function may be activated for swift temperature reduction. This feature automatically adjusts settings for efficient cooling. A thermometer can be used to monitor the internal temperature, ensuring it remains below safe thresholds for perishability.

**Food Preparation and Wrapping**

Before storing foods, ensure they are properly wrapped to retain quality and prevent contamination. Shellfish, meat, and other perishables are best stored in the 0°C section to enhance freshness without compromising safety.

**Defrosting Practices**

The defrosting compartment efficiently removes ice buildup, and regular maintenance should include emptying the compartment when ice thickness is excessive. Caution should be exercised not to use external heat sources for speeding up this process, as it can compromise the appliance’s integrity.

**Cleaning Instructions**

To maintain hygiene, ensure the appliance is disconnected from electricity before cleaning. Use non-abbrasive cleaners and avoid substances containing bleach to prevent damage. Follow the recommended cleaning procedures to maintain performance and safety.

**Troubleshooting**

Users may experience various sounds or alerts related to cooling efficiencies and door closures. If the appliance operates outside normal parameters, indicators such as flashing lights or warning tones will signal for attention. Consult the provided resources or service guides for detailed troubleshooting.

This document adheres to EU directives 73/23/EWG, 89/336/EWG (including 92/31/EWG), regarding technical terminology related to cooling. The heat generated during the cooling process is transferred away from the food or other items stored, with the system designed to efficiently manage heat displacement. The cooling unit is installed in the rear and is built-in, ensuring optimal functionality.
