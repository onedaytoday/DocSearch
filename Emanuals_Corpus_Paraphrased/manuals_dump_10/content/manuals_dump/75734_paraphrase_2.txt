This guidance applies to children and individuals involved with cleaning services, along with functions such as switching off COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC modes. Proper positioning of shelves and maintaining the cleanliness of food storage areas are critical, and the following details provide insights aimed at helping users choose high-quality products effectively.

**Safety Precautions:**
- Ensure that children and individuals with reduced physical capabilities or limited knowledge of the appliance do not have unsupervised access to it to prevent hazards such as suffocation or electric shock.
- Keep the appliance area clear of obstructions; overheating can lead to fires or malfunctions.

**Appliance Setup:**
- Upon unpacking, allow the appliance to sit upright for at least four hours to stabilize coolant flow before usage.
- The back of the unit should not be placed against any surfaces to avoid overheating.

**Operating COOLMATIC & FROSTMATIC Functions:**
- Activate the COOLMATIC function using the designated switch. A flashing light indicates the function is active, while an acoustic signal notes temperature changes.
- To deactivate, set the ON/OFF switch to OFF.
- The FROSTMATIC function should be engaged when storing fresh produce, utilizing similar activation procedures as with the COOLMATIC.

**Shelf Management:**
- Adjust shelves to accommodate various food items effectively. Ensure compatibility with bottles by positioning them with the opening facing frontward.

**Auditory Signals:**
- Normal operational sounds include whirring and occasional cracking, which are indicative of operational efficiency. If unusual sounds occur or these signals increase in frequency, it may indicate an overload or malfunction.

**Defrosting Instructions:**
- Regular defrosting is required to maintain optimal appliance performance. Follow cleaning instructions to ensure all components remain free from frost and debris for effective operation. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**
- Regularly clean the unit, removing any food residues and ensuring that insulation materials meet safety standards. Follow recommended cleaning methods for surfaces to maintain the integrity of the appliance.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the appliance exhibits operational issues, verify the door seals are secure and check for any obstruction in air vents.

These instructions aim to facilitate the effective use of the appliance while ensuring safety and performance standards are met.

### Troubleshooting and Technical Instructions

#### Common Issues
1. **Frost Accumulation and Cooling Issues**
   - Frequent activation of the FROSTMATIC and COOLMATIC functions can lead to excessive frost buildup.
   - Ensure that water is flowing properly, as blockages can prevent appropriate drainage, leading to frost issues.
   - Verify that products are not placed too close together, which can restrict airflow and lead to improper cooling.

2. **Defrosting Problems**
   - If frost accumulation is excessive, check if the defrosting outlet is clogged and clean it if necessary.
   - Ensure all items are stored correctly and spaced adequately to facilitate air circulation.

#### Installation and Safety Precautions

- Maintain a distance from heat sources and ensure there is adequate airflow around the appliance.

#### Wiring Information
- Proper connection of the power supply is crucial:
  - Yellow wire: Earth
  - Brown wire: Live (L)
  - Blue wire: Neutral (N)
