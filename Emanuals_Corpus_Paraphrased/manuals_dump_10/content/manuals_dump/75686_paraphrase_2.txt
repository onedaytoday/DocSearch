**Chillers Overview**  
Chillers are designed to cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C quickly, reducing bacterial growth. This rapid chilling process allows for safe food storage at +3°C, enabling the food to maintain quality without deterioration. 

**Chilling Mechanism**  
The chilling system operates continuously, using built-in features that provide comprehensive performance. There are different modes for soft chilling (2°C) and standard chilling (12°C). Each mode is activated automatically when food is inserted into the unit. Additional features include built-in UV sanitation and a frost-free operation mechanism.

**Operating Status and Monitoring**  
The digital display indicates countdown timers and service notifications. Two operating modes (P1 and P2) are available, allowing for thorough monitoring of food temperature and compliance with HACCP standards, even if the process is interrupted.

**Construction and Insulation**  
Built with AISI stainless steel and high-density polyurethane insulation, these chillers are HCFC-free and conform to various ISO standards. The design features rounded corners and includes IP20 protection, ensuring durability and safety.

**Technical Specifications**  
- Chilling efficiency is compliant with NF Regulations for both domestic and UK standards.
- Various configurations and dimensions are available, including GN types and installation options.
- Supporting technical accessories include a single sensor probe, wheels, and specialized kits for different chilling applications.

**Hygiene and Certification**  
The RBC051 model is certified by AFAQ AFNOR, adhering to NF031 standards for hygiene and thermal performance. The chillers are designed for easy cleaning and efficient cooling.

**Accessories Included**  
Accessories provided include single sensor probes for chillers and freezers, blast chiller kits, HACCP connectivity options, and various shelving solutions for enhanced storage and organization. 

**Installation Requirements**  
Users can opt for optional plumbing features, depending on their specific setup needs. 

**Model References**  
Key models include RBC051 and RBC061, with the latter offering further flexibility. Each meets rigorous standards for food safety and operational efficiency.
