After washing, secure the hose connections and clean the lint filter regularly. Disconnect the appliance from the power supply for maintenance, and thoroughly clean both the exterior and interior components, especially the recesses that may accumulate detergent residues.

If there are any performance issues, check for clogs in the hose or other malfunctions indicated by error codes (e.g., E10, E20, E40). Ensure all connections are tight and properly installed. Responses to malfunctions should be immediate to prevent further complications.

For washing delicate fabrics, opt for specific cycles and temperature settings, and if necessary, consult the manufacturer’s guidelines for any special handling instructions.
