Here's the paraphrased text:

The ECO VALVE facilitates emergency drainage through the emptying hose. If necessary, disconnect and cool down the system as outlined in the instructions. Clean and secure the cover as previously stated, ensuring all steps are followed to avoid service issues. A flashing indicator suggests a problem, such as improper closure or obstruction of the hose. Take immediate action if any alert light signals malfunction. Confirm the hose is securely connected and not blocked. Ensure that the selected options are appropriate and function as needed. If there are stubborn blockages, clean or redisperse materials in the hose using suitable products. 

For service requests or purchase inquiries, contact customer service using the provided information. Ratings and specifications for the water supply are detailed in the AWF8120 technical chart.
