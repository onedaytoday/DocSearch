**Preparation of Cubes and Defrosting Instructions**

To prepare the cubes, it is essential to defrost them adequately, aiming for uniformity in texture. The defrosting process will remove any frost buildup, which forms during storage. This frost must be cleared to ensure proper thawing. Defrost foods at least once, monitoring the frost thickness, but avoid over-defrosting. Be cautious, as inappropriate heating methods or mechanical devices during defrosting can be hazardous and may negatively impact food safety and the integrity of plastic components.

Keep food cool and covered during defrosting, using materials such as layers of newspaper. Always switch off the appliance and disconnect it from the electrical supply for safety during cleaning. 

**Cleaning Instructions**

Regular cleaning is necessary for efficient operation. Ensure that all surfaces are cleaned thoroughly, and refer to the Cleaning section for guidance. When cleaning, deactivate the power supply to prevent electric shock. Avoid using harsh chemicals; instead, use recommended cleaning agents for food preparation areas. After ensuring that all components are cool, clean appliances with a cloth and designated cleaner.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**

If you encounter malfunctions, refer to the troubleshooting guidelines. In cases where the appliance appears switched off or the power supply is compromised, follow the recommended steps to reset or adjust settings. Regularly check for potential issues such as frost buildup, temperatures that are too cold, and ensure they are corrected according to the instructions provided.
