### EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION

This section addresses the operation and specifications of the equipment. The unit features an internally mounted, sound-attenuated design with protective components, specifically the AC leads connected to the input and switch. It includes several features, such as insulation classified as NEMA MG1-32.6 and NEMA MG1-1.66. The AC waveform and power factor comply with NEMA MG1-32 standards.

### ENGINE OIL RECOMMENDATIONS

The engine requires high-quality oil, such as 15W-40, that meets classification standards CC, SD, SE, and SF. For optimal performance, below freezing temperatures may necessitate an alternative oil such as 5W-synthetic, SAE 30W, or 15W-40. It is crucial to perform regular servicing in these conditions to maintain proper function.

### COOLANT RECOMMENDATIONS

The coolant specifications should be adhered to in order to avoid issues such as overheating. Use recommended coolant types that are compatible and ensure that the system does not contain chromate, which can contribute to overheating. Caution is advised when handling coolant to avoid burns; the recovery bottle should always be securely closed.

### ENGINE PROTECTIVE DEVICES

The protective devices are essential to prevent potential damage under abnormal operating conditions, such as excessive temperature or pressure. Key components include:

- **High Coolant Temperature Switch:** Activates if coolant temperature exceeds 210°F, leading to a shutdown and illuminating an LED indicator.
  
- **Low Coolant Level Sensor:** Prevents overheating if coolant drops below a critical level.

- **Low Oil Pressure Switch:** Will trip at low oil pressure during cranking or operation, requiring the system to be reset.

- **Overcrank Shutdown:** Triggers if cranking exceeds a specified period; the system can be reset by toggling the AUTO/OFF/MANUAL switch.

- **Overspeed Shutdown:** Engages when RPM exceeds a safe threshold, ensuring protection against excessive speed.

- **RPM Sensor Loss Shutdown:** Initiates shutdown if signal loss occurs.

- **DC Fuse:** Protects against overcurrent situations.

### FUEL SYSTEM FUEL REQUIREMENTS

The fuel system operates on either natural gas or propane. Specific dimensions and configurations must be followed to ensure fuel supply lines are adequate, including maintaining a minimum elevation of 6 inches. It is the responsibility of the owner/operator to ensure compliance with these specifications.

- **Natural Gas System:** Adequate ventilation to prevent gas accumulation is essential.

- **Propane Vapor Withdrawal System:** Sufficient line diameter is necessary for efficient operation. Ensure the system can function optimally and maintain proper cooling.

### SPECIFICATIONS

- **Generator Type:** Synchronous insulation class with compliance to ISO 8528-5, BS 5514, SAE J1349, and DIN standards.

- **Engine Specifications:** Naturally aspirated with a compression ratio of 9.4:1 and standard bore and stroke dimensions.

- **Cooling System:** Adequate coolant capacity to manage heat rejection and ensure operational efficiency.

- **Electrical System:** Contains a 12V static battery charger with recommended battery specifications.

### GENERATOR CONNECTION BOX CONFIGURATION

An optional cold weather kit (0F6148) is available, including a battery warmer and junction box for 5W-30 synthetic oil. To convert the fuel system from natural gas to propane, specific procedures must be followed, ensuring no interruption in service.

### GENERATOR AC LEAD CONNECTIONS

The generator may have configurations for either single-phase or three-phase connections. Ensure correct wire placement according to rated specifications for proper operation.

- **Single-Phase Connection:** Typically uses a four-lead setup for 240V supply.

- **Three-Phase Connections:** Factory-configured for various loads, ensuring correct terminal arrangements for voltage ratings.

Following these guidelines will ensure optimal operation and safety of the equipment.
