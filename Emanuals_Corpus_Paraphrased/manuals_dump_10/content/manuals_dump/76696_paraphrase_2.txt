**A. Setting Up the Screen**  
Follow these steps to position the screen vertically and align it with the ground. Ensure the junction is secure. Rotate the casing until it is grounded, with the top facing upward. Confirm that the components are aligned properly. Do not apply excessive pressure to the top locking mechanism; use the height lock/release feature appropriately.

**B. Adjusting Screen Height**  
Adhere to the instructions provided to prevent any adverse effects when adjusting screen height. An undesirable effect may occur if adjustments are not made correctly. To change the height, rotate the screen counter-clockwise using the height lock/release mechanism located near the carrying handle. Once the desired height is reached, secure it again.

**C. Unlocking and Adjusting the Height**  
Follow the instructions to unlock the height adjustment mechanism. Rotate the lock counter-clockwise to release the screen. Once adjusted, ensure that the screen is moved to its original position. After that, rotate the screen clockwise to secure it in place. For maintenance, clean the screen regularly to ensure optimal performance.
