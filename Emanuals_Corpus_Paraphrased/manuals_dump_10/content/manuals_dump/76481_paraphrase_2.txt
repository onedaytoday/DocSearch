### TM and Water Note

**Important Information if Purchased with TM and Water:** 

When purchasing the TM and Water, please refer to the following instructions and information. The water supply is located at the back right of the fresh food compartment. Make sure it is turned off. The unit may have been tested at the factory for proper operation. It is essential to access the Water Works section for optimal use and to review the Consumer Assistance guidelines, especially if you are using the RG-100 or NGRG-2000 Ice and Water models, which have been tested and meet NSF International health and safety standards as well as ANSI/NSF performance specifications. 

Ensure that the water supply is properly rated for capacity, flow rate, and pressure (GPM and PSI). Regular maintenance every few months is recommended to maintain peak performance. To turn the water supply off, grip it firmly and turn it towards the 'OFF' position, gently moving it back and forth if necessary. If you need assistance with the housing or screws, contact Consumer Assistance. 

**Important: The light indications** prompt operational checks. If the system does not operate as expected, consult the included instructions and ensure proper installation.

### Food Storage Guidelines

Fresh food storage is most effective when the temperature is set to 34°F to 40°F. Avoid overcrowding shelves to ensure proper air circulation and cooling, particularly around meat products, which should be securely wrapped to avoid contamination. Foods should be stored in airtight containers to prevent freezer burn and ensure freshness. Hard-to-freeze items should be placed where air can circulate freely. 

### Energy-Saving Tips

To optimize energy efficiency, reduce exposure to direct sunlight and heat sources, like ovens and dishwashers, especially in cabinetry. Ensure insulation is intact, and clean the condenser coils regularly to maintain efficiency.

### Understanding Operational Sounds

Familiarize yourself with normal operational sounds, which can vary in intensity and include:

- A sound of air moving through vents.
- A hissing or heating sound from the defrost heater.
- Clicking when turning on or off the appliance.

Should you hear abnormal sounds, investigate for potential issues.

### Cleaning Recommendations

Regular cleaning is essential to prevent buildup. Use a gentle cloth for surfaces and avoid abrasive materials. Be sure to turn off the unit before cleaning and allow parts to cool if needed. 

### Light Bulb Replacement

When replacing light bulbs, ensure that the appliance is unplugged, and wear protective gear to avoid injury. Follow manufacturer guidelines for the type of bulb required.
