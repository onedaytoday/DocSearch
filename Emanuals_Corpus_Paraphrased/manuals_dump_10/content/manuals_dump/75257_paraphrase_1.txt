### DEFROST FUNCTION

This feature is designed for thawing foods, including items that may be covered in icings, frostings, or cheesecakes. To activate DEFROST, switch the appliance to the Defrost setting. 

#### IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS 

The interior lighting and cooling processes can affect defrosting efficiency. The environment can impact how quickly food thaws; colder conditions may slow down the process. For optimal results, it's recommended to thaw meat and similar items using this function. While defrost times can vary, thin cuts of meat or minced items may require fewer hours, while larger items could take approximately several hours. Food should be cooked immediately after thawing or refrigerated if not used right away to prevent bacterial growth.

### CARE AND CLEANING 

Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and has cooled down. Avoid using cleaners that contain bleach, as they can damage the finishes. 

#### EXTERIOR CLEANING 

For the outer surfaces, use a soft cloth with suitable cleaners that won’t harm painted finishes. Wipe spills immediately to maintain the appliance's appearance. 

#### CONTROL KNOBS AND HANDLES 

Use caution when cleaning these areas, as inappropriate cleaning materials may dull the surface.

#### REMOVING AND REPLACING WIREWORK RUNNERS 

To remove shelves and wirework runners, unhook them from the top of the cavity, then carefully pull them out. 

#### HOB CLEANING 

Clean the hotplate by wiping the surface and ensuring the light indicator works correctly. The crowns should be cleaned regularly, and care should be taken to avoid scrubbing too aggressively to maintain their appearance.

### CLEANING THE GRILL AND OVEN COMPARTMENTS 

The interior surfaces, including the back, are coated with Stayclean materials and should be manually cleaned using non-abrasive cleaners. To ensure effective cleaning, maintain a temperature below 220°C. The Stayclean feature helps reduce food splatters, but it’s advisable to avoid excessive roasting techniques that could intensify splattering.

### CLEANING DOORS AND GLASS PANELS 

For thorough cleaning, avoid using bleach or aggressive chemicals. 

To clean between the outer and inner door glass, carefully remove the inner glass panel, clean both surfaces, and replace securely.
