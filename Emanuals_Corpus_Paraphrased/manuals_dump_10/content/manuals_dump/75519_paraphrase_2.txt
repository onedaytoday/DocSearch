### Technical Paraphrase

The cooking function can be activated or deactivated within a few seconds. When the cooking surface cools down, the heat function resets automatically. Repeated acoustic signals may indicate that the heat has been switched off and will sound again after another few seconds. The overheating protection feature will switch off the cooking function to prevent damage to the cookware. If the cooking surface is inactive, it will be disconnected from the power supply. 

For child safety, a child lock feature deactivates the section when tampered with, especially if an obstructive cloth partially covers it. Itâ€™s essential to ensure that the cooking area is clear for optimal performance. The appliance must be used according to the specifications provided, including using cookware compatible with the cooking technology.
