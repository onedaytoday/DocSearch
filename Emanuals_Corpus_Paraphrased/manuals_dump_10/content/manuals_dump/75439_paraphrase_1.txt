### Selecting Software and Settings

To initiate your selection of software, begin by navigating through the available options and make adjustments to the settings or text as needed. If the displayed text reflects the current choice, proceed based on your selection. Preheating should commence while preparing to cook. Once the appliance reaches the designated temperature, the Luxury-Lighting feature activates, illuminating the interior with adjustable theater-quality lighting, found both at the front and rear.

### Lighting Controls

The lighting operates whenever the appliance is in use. It is crucial to follow the guidelines outlined in the Cleaning section. Once the oven is locked, the light switch will toggle between on and off. To engage the CONTROL LOCK, press the designated buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. When locked, the control can only be manipulated while the cavity light is active, indicated by a flashing display.

### Cookware Considerations

The type and placement of cookware significantly affect cooking efficiency. Select cookware capable of conducting heat well, and ensure it is compatible with the rotating mechanism. Be mindful of the cookware’s position, as it should not block heat circulation. 

### Cooking Parameters and Features

For optimal cooking performance, the cookware should be appropriate for the heat sources. Utilize the controls by turning them counterclockwise to adjust the BTU settings based on the requirements of the food being prepared. Refer to the accompanying chart for specific cleaning and defrosting options.

### Preheating and Cooking Tips

When using the preheat option, various cooking features apply, such as Convection with specific temperature presets (e.g., 350°F/176°C to 550°F/288°C). To expedite preheating, use the Rapid Preheat command and press START. Monitor the heating process carefully, as it can be canceled at any time.

### Recipe and Cooking Guidelines

For browning or cooking specific food items, ensure proper preheating with recommended temperatures. Follow specific guidelines to ensure safety and efficiency in the cooking process. If a fire occurs, never attempt to extinguish it with water; instead, use an appropriate fire extinguisher.

### Convection Cooking

The Perfect-Convect feature maintains consistent heating, which can enhance cooking results. It is recommended to follow cooking instructions closely when using the Convection Convert option to ensure optimal performance. Adjust temperatures accordingly, and ensure that food is spaced properly within the oven to allow heat to circulate effectively.

Remember, you can always cancel preset functions or cooking processes when necessary, ensuring flexibility in your cooking operations.

The option provides the ability to use Convection with CONV BAKE for optimal cooking performance. It allows food items to be cooked according to recommended guidelines, ensuring they are evenly heated. Note that you can cancel the cooking process at any time. To begin, set the temperature to approximately 350°F (176°C). 

To activate, press UPPER OVEN, followed by CONV BAKE, then COOK OPTIONS, and select CONV CONVERT. Once you press START, the display will indicate PRE-HEATING until the oven reaches the set temperature, at which point PRE-HEATING will turn off and cooking can commence. 

For roasting, the roasting pan catches grease, enhancing cooking efficiency while allowing heat to circulate around the food. Ensure the food is positioned securely without a cover, and monitor for over-browning using the provided Convection Roasting Chart.

To guarantee meat is properly cooked, utilize the probe feature to monitor internal temperatures at key points, such as 170°F (76°C) for poultry. It is crucial to check the thickest part of the meat, taking care to avoid touching the bone.

For defrosting, keep in mind to follow USDA guidelines to prevent foodborne illnesses. Select the UPPER OVEN, press DEFROST, and note that cooking processes can be canceled anytime.

When using the SLOW COOK function, ensure that food is completely thawed prior to cooking. The temperature ranges from 225°F (108°C) to 275°F (134°C) based on the type of food being prepared. 

The BREAD PROOF setting lightly covers the dough while allowing heat to surround it, enabling proper rising. Be cautious during cooking processes to avoid overheating, which can compromise the food's quality. 

For precise cooking, utilize the MY FAVORITE feature, which allows you to recall specific settings quickly. You can overwrite existing settings as needed by following the on-screen instructions.

The oven supports a range of cooking functions, including Bake, Convection, and Broil. Temperature settings can be adjusted from 150°F (66°C) to 500°F, depending on the desired cooking outcome. To initiate any cooking program, follow the prescribed steps, ensuring the desired settings are confirmed before starting.

Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

This section pertains to using the oven during the Sabbath or holidays. It primarily involves the BAKE function and the oven's heating features. Initially, select the BAKE option and set either the upper or lower oven, followed by the COOK TIME. The COOK TIME feature has a factory preset of 1 hour and governs the cooking functions. When using these features during the Sabbath, if the lights are activated, they will automatically turn off once the user has finished setting them. It is advisable to initiate with the START function; however, should there be an error in setup, the temperature can be readjusted within the range of 170°F to 550°F. 

In the event of a fire, it is crucial to have a fire extinguisher available. Do not use foil to line the oven drawer or cover the racks, as this could obstruct airflow and create safety hazards. Additionally, ensure that cooking items are placed at the correct height to facilitate even cooking and prevent overheating.

Cooking food items can occur using specified temperature guidelines such as 350°F (176°C), 170°F (76°C), and 450°F (232°C). The display will indicate when preheating is complete, and it is critical to monitor food at adequate temperatures to avoid foodborne illnesses. 

Flatware and similar items should also be heated at specified temperatures. Proper clean-up is necessary, and the oven cavity should be cleaned without abrasive cleaners. 

To manage user preferences, navigate through the options using the USER PREF button. Adjustments for the clock, temperature offset, audio preferences, and self-cleaning functions are available through straightforward button presses. The self-cleaning feature employs high temperatures to make cleaning easier without the need for chemical cleaners, though care should be exercised to remove racks prior to initiating a self-clean cycle.

Ensure proper protocols are followed to safeguard the oven during the self-clean process, including monitoring the cooling phase and ensuring that the oven door remains locked until the cleaning cycle is fully complete. 

These instructions summarize operating and cleaning procedures, temperature settings, and guidelines for proper usage during specific circumstances.
