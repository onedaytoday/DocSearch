#### IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
For the safe use of this appliance, adhere to the following guidelines. If you have any doubts regarding these instructions, consult the customer service. Please ensure the appliance is connected according to the specifications provided. Avoid exposing the unit to heat sources or direct sunlight, and ensure adequate ventilation. When moving the appliance, turn it off and allow it to stabilize for a minimum of a few hours. Be cautious of any potential ignition sources. Keep children away from the appliance to prevent accidents such as suffocation. The cooling and charging should only be handled by authorized technicians. Bottles, especially carbonated ones, may burst if frozen, so it’s recommended to follow the manufacturer's guidelines for freezing items.

#### OPERATION
The yellow warning light signifies activation, while the red light serves as a food temperature alert. Adjust the thermostat by turning it until it reaches the desired setting, typically indicated by the appliance's design. If the red light illuminates, the food has reached a temperature that requires attention. For optimal food freshness, adhere to the timeframes outlined in the instructions for fast freezing and subsequent storage. Always allow food to cool before placing it in the unit to maintain efficiency. Items should be cooked or properly thawed as per guidelines to avoid spoilage.

#### HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES
To prevent food contamination, cool cooked items promptly and store them properly. Ensure food remains covered and avoid thawing at room temperature. Use non-porous containers for storage and ensure hygiene throughout handling. Monitor food freshness regularly and discard any items that show signs of spoilage.

#### DEFROSTING
Defrost the appliance when frost buildup becomes significant. Turn off the unit and allow it to reach room temperature. Use newspaper to collect melting water during the defrost cycle and clean thoroughly once complete. Follow specific guidelines for different food types, ensuring they are stored correctly to minimize ice crystal formation.

#### MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING
Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electrical outlet to ensure safety. Use soft cleaning agents—avoid abrasive substances or strong chemicals that could damage the appliance surface. Regular maintenance ensures efficiency and prolongs the appliance's lifespan.

#### TROUBLESHOOTING
If any issues arise, please refer to the troubleshooting section. Common symptoms include unusual frost build-up or temperature inconsistencies. Customers should remain within the operating temperature range of 10°C to 38°C and verify that the thermostat settings are correct.
