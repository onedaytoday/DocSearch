**Installation Instructions for EDFP210FPC and EDFP217FPC**

To ensure a smooth and accurate installation, please read these simple guidelines thoroughly before proceeding. Verify that your installation aligns with all relevant plumbing, electrical, and safety codes.

For reference, the LKFRB1, which is included with the shipment, is designed to heat the fountain. It is important to note that grounding electrical equipment, such as telephones and computers, to water lines is a standard practice. This grounding may occur within the building or externally, but it can introduce electrical feedback into the fountain, leading to electrolysis. This sometimes results in a metallic taste or an increased metal concentration in the water. Such problems can be mitigated by employing the recommended materials. Ensure that any drain fittings installed are made of plastic to provide electrical isolation between the fountain and the plumbing system.

**Important Notes:**
- All service work should be conducted by authorized personnel. 
- Installers should take heed of the following details.
- Refer to the mounting bolt and access hole layouts in Figures 97565C for EDFP210FP and EDFP214FP.

**Rough-In Requirements:**
Ensure the wall is prepared as illustrated, complying with ANSI A117.1 and ADA guidelines. Securely fasten the fountain using the provided screws and washers, and follow the enclosed instructions for installation.

**Cable Adjustments:**
For optimal mounting of the heated units, adjust the positioning as required. Ensure the operating cable is threaded correctly to allow free movement and to avoid complications during fountain operation. Ensure water supply and stream height meet the factory specifications, adjusting as necessary.

**Water Connection Notes:**
Refer to the provided diagrams regarding water flow direction. Utilize push-fit connectors for ease of installationâ€”simply push in to secure and pull to release. Ensure that the ends of tubes are properly seated in the fittings.
