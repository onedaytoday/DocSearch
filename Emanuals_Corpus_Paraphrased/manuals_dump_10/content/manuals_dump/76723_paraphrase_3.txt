### STROBE INSTALLATION FOR ELK-1RT OR ELK-150RT STAINLESS STEEL BOX

**A)** If your ELK stainless steel box is already installed, remove the front cover (the speaker does not need to be removed). For new installations, mount the stainless steel backplate and speaker/siren according to the provided instructions.

**B)** Attach the strobe unit to the lower flange of the backplate by sliding the clear plastic wiring protector into the left (outer) slot on the lower flange. Ensure that the end with the loose wires is facing you and positioned upwards. Verify that the wire slide is fully against the wall.

**C)** Connect the red (12V+) and black wires from the strobe to the non-pulsed alarm output or violation output. (Note that most pulsed outputs may also work with the strobe, but the flash rate may be slightly irregular.)
