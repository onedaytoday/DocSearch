**FROSTMATIC Function**  
The FROSTMATIC feature can be activated or deactivated manually. When turned on, it operates for a set number of hours, during which the indicator light is illuminated. Manually switching off the FROSTMATIC will halt its operation, allowing the appliance to return to standard conditions. To disable it, use the ON/OFF switch, which operates on a countdown timer. Once the timer elapses, the FROSTMATIC function will turn off. In the event of a power supply disruption, the FROSTMATIC function will remain off until reinstated manually.

The FROSTMATIC feature also assists in preserving food quality by cooling it quickly when placed on the LONGFRESH 0°C shelves. These shelves are adjustable for height to accommodate various bottle sizes and food items. Proper organization is essential; taller items should be placed at the back, while shorter ones go in the front. Foods should be stored strategically to maintain airflow.

The LONGFRESH 0°C compartment maintains a consistent temperature approximately at 0°C, creating an optimal environment for fresh food storage. This feature ensures that fruits and vegetables stay fresh longer and are defrosted effectively without compromising quality. It is important to manage humidity levels to prevent food from drying out. For best practices, keep items covered or properly wrapped to maintain their texture and moisture.

**Food Storage Recommendations**  
Foods that should be stored in the LONGFRESH 0°C compartment include various fruits and vegetables, each with specific recommended storage durations. For instance, onions can last up to a month, while apples and pears should be used within a shorter timeframe to maintain freshness. Ensure food is airtight to prevent spoilage from moisture loss.

**Defrosting Procedures**  
Defrosting is enhanced by a built-in heater designed to facilitate the process. The frost buildup should be monitored; when it reaches a certain thickness, it's important to perform a defrost cycle. Please adhere to safety guidelines to avoid electrical hazards during this process.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Regular cleaning of the appliance is crucial for its functionality. Ensure the FROSTMATIC function is off and unplug the unit before cleaning to prevent electric shocks. Use appropriate cleaning agents and methods to maintain surfaces without damaging components.

**Troubleshooting**  
In the event of malfunction, refer to the specified guidelines for corrective measures. For persistent issues, please contact customer service. It is important to follow the operational manual closely for optimal performance, and to verify if components like lights or cooling functions are operating correctly.

**Regulatory Compliance**  
This appliance complies with relevant electronic and safety regulations, which aim to ensure consumer safety and product reliability. Always operate within the specified guidelines for best results.

**Technical Overview**  
The cooling mechanism relies on efficient heat exchange, where warmth is extracted from the food and ambient surroundings. The system is designed to minimize energy loss while maximizing cooling efficiency, which is facilitated by its built-in components. Proper installation and placement are vital to ensure optimal function and airflow around the appliance.
