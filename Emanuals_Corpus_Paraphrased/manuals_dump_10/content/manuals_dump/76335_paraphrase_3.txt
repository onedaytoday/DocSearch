**FOM CLS Software Adjustment**
The FOM CLS software includes several updates:
- Adjustments for temperature settings and flow rates are implemented. 
- The calibration process for speed, both low and high ranges, has been refined. 
- A backlight feature has been added for enhanced visibility during operation. 

**Inspection Protocol**
The reference inspection for the FOM CLS system requires thorough evaluation of connections, including hoses and flow pathways, ensuring they are unobstructed and comply with specifications. Connections should be made from suitable materials, predominantly PVC, to guarantee reliability. The water supply pressure and flow rates must be monitored to ensure they meet outlined criteria prior to operation.

**Operational Guidelines**
The FOM CLS relies on an integrated system that activates under specific conditions, including heating elements. The assembly instructions detail the configuration of components, including manual and automated functionalities. 

**Service and Calibration Procedures**
Actionable service programs allow for the management of various counters and calibrations, including trip hour counters and wash program counters. Calibration for the level sensor should be meticulously followed to ensure correct operation and prompt service notifications when adjustments are needed.

**Installation and Configuration**
Upon installation, ensure that all hoses are correctly connected and calibrated according to factory settings. This involves checking both the configuration and the performance of the system when activated, ensuring it functions as intended.

**Troubleshooting and Adjustments**
In cases where the calibration is indicated to be off, adjustments to the flow rates and speed settings may need to be made. Procedures for addressing weight discrepancies and installation issues are also provided to maintain the machine's efficacy.

**User Settings and Functional Adjustments**
System settings allow for user-defined adjustments concerning operation time, temperature control, program modes, and manual functions. The functionalities are designed to enhance user experience while maintaining safety and efficiency.

**Note on Authorized Service**
For any modifications or technical issues, authorized technicians should be contacted to ensure compliance with established guidelines. The documentation includes specific instructions for servicing, error corrections, and operational adjustments for maintaining optimal performance. 

This documentation serves as a technical reference to ensure the operational integrity of the FOM CLS washer system.

### Table Function Overview 

This table outlines the default settings and explanation for various functions related to the heating operation of the system. 

- **PC5 HEATING BLOCKING:** Defines priority for heating, distinguishing between different operational modes. Standard operations are not affected.
  
- **SERVICE ALARM:** Provides service notifications, including alarm for process timeout, both at the end and during pauses, which requires attention for error notifications like overfilling.

- **PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS:** Activation depends on system configurations, necessitating a password for access.

- **LEVEL IN MM:** The highest software reading reflects the measured level from the FOM CLS, essential for maintaining operational standards.

- **START SLOW FILLING & OFFSET LEVEL:** Adjustments in filling accuracy are influenced by temperature settings and the software's calibration parameters.

### Speed Calibration

- **SPEED CALIBRATION - LOW AND HIGH RANGE:** These adjustments are made in software to align RPM readings with actual performance, correcting any discrepancies in measurements.

### Cleaning Procedures

- **Cleaning of FOM CLS:** Regular cleaning of the system is essential to prevent performance issues caused by accumulated lint, threads, or other debris. This involves inspecting heating elements and ensuring their functionality while preventing obstruction of air and water flow.

- **Repair Guidelines:** Detailed instructions for repairs include disconnecting hoses, cleaning connections, and ensuring everything is properly assembled without pinching any components.

### Inspection and Compliance 

- **Regular Inspections:** The FOM CLS requires ongoing inspections to align with IEC specifications. This includes verifying that cooling, heating, and supply systems are functioning correctly. 

- **Safety and Maintenance Protocols:** Follow precise protocols for system maintenance to ensure longevity and optimal performance, as outlined in specific chapters of the guidelines.

### Heating Efficiency and Standards 

- **Heating Reference Standards:** The system operates within specific temperature ranges to maintain efficiency. Monitoring for temperature accuracy is crucial, ensuring that relays and other components are functioning as intended.

- **FOM CLS EMPTY Protocol:** Defines procedures for specific heating actions across various temperatures, ensuring compliance with quality standards.

By adhering to these guidelines, operators can ensure the system's optimal performance and compliance with safety regulations.

**FOM Laboratory Operations and Heating Adjustments**

The attached FOM provides procedural guidelines for laboratory operations related to the heating of the BSP system. This documentation covers authorized laboratory activities. 

In instances where the FOM contradicts CLS standards, refer to the internal software protocols. If the heating temperature is excessively high or low, adjustments must be made, including potential replacement of components. 

Should flow rates be inaccurate due to high incoming pressure, flow adjustments should be implemented. Chapter flow outlines the flow characteristics between the ELS and FOM, ensuring a streamlined setup.

The flow K-factor must be calibrated for each installation, influencing the amount of supply flow. If discrepancy arises, follow the outlined procedures to select appropriate settings without external instruments initially.

Proper flow calibration must be verified regularly. Ensure all components are functioning correctly, as malfunctioning parts impact overall laboratory efficiency. Cleaning according to the provided steps will enhance performance and prevent clogging from contaminants such as lint and threads.

Regular inspection of the incoming supply will help maintain optimal operation. Disassembled parts should be cleaned periodically to avoid performance degradation.

For the motor-operated systems, ensure self-clearing functionality remains intact by checking cross-sectional parameters. The acme-threaded apparatus should function smoothly, eliminating air blockages while ensuring proper flow control. 

Follow cleaning instructions diligently to prevent blockages in the supply lines. All components should be secured correctly for safe operation.

For routine maintenance, check the heating relays and ensure they operate within specified parameters, responding to temperature thresholds accurately. Ensure that the heating system is properly calibrated to avoid unnecessary downtime. 

In conclusion, strict adherence to the outlined procedures is crucial to maintain optimal performance and accuracy within laboratory settings, while regular inspections and cleaning will mitigate long-term operational issues.
