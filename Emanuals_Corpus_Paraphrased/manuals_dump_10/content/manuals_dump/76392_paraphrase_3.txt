To ensure safe operation, do not attempt repairs if you are inexperienced, as this may lead to serious malfunctions. Only qualified AEG/ELECTROLUX personnel should perform repairs. Before operation, read the instructions thoroughly and ensure correct handling to prevent any mishaps.

Keep children away from the washer-dryer when it is in operation. If any functionality is compromised or behaves unexpectedly, it is your responsibility to follow the instructions and rectify the issue. Specific care instructions are provided for various fabrics, and only use recommended detergents and bleaches.

For recycling information and environmentally safe disposal, consult your local household service or municipality. The washer-dryer is designed for standard washing of fabrics, typically without prewashing required.

The machine includes options to manage drying efficiently, employing functions that minimize wrinkling and improve usability. Selecting the proper drying setting (e.g., DELICATE or ECONOMY) allows for energy efficiency. 

Each selected cycle is accompanied by indicator lights and auditory signals for easy monitoring. In the event of an interruption, the START/PAUSE function allows you to resume washing or drying as needed. 

For cycles like PREWASH and STAIN, be aware of their specific utility; these features efficiently handle stains and pre-treatment needs. The frequency of cleaning cycles is vital for maintaining the appliance's integrity. 

Sorting laundry by type and color is crucial for optimal washing results. Manage whites, colored fabrics, and delicates effectively to avoid cross-contamination. Follow guidelines for maximum load capacities and care instructions for each fabric type mentioned.

Use appropriate additives for stain removal and special washing conditions. Only specified treatments should be employed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Always prioritize adherence to these instructions for the best performance from your washer-dryer.

Certainly! Here's a paraphrased version while keeping the technical details intact:

The choice of detergent—whether in powder or liquid form—directly impacts the laundering process. Traditional powders should be applied directly to the clothes, whereas traditional liquids can be introduced through a measured dispenser located on the top and back of the machine. Compact powders and liquids follow similar guidelines; adhere to the given instructions for direct application or dosing. Fabric conditioners are crucial as they help in softening fabrics and facilitating easy care.

When using the washer, ensure to follow the operational guidelines. Always monitor the load size; overloading the machine can lead to issues, particularly with synthetic materials that may pose combustion risks. 

For optimal drying, choose the correct cycle based on the items being washed. Refer to the provided chart to determine settings specific to fabric types. For example, initiating a cycle may require you to press the START/PAUSE button after selecting your desired program. If there is a need for a rinse cycle, utilize the RINSE option to ensure thorough cleaning. 

Additional features include an EXTRA RINSE function, which can be activated by pressing the SPIN SPEED and DRYING TIME buttons for a few seconds to ensure proper rinsing results. The DELAY START option can also be set, allowing you to pre-program the cycle start time with a visual countdown.

For acoustic feedback, an option to deactivate the buzzer can be set by pressing the TIME SAVER and SPIN SPEED buttons briefly. If troubleshooting is required, follow the instructions provided for resolving common issues such as E10 (water supply error) or E20 (drainage error).

For maintenance, periodically clean the hose and check for blockages. If temperatures fall below 0°C, ensure proper precautions are taken to prevent freezing risks. Overall, consistent adherence to guidelines provided in the machine's manual will lead to effective performance and longevity.
