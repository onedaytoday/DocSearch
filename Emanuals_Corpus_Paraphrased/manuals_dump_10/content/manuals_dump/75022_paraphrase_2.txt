**Placement and Cooking Guidelines**  
When using the oven, position food centrally on the shelf to ensure even cooking. It is important to allow space around the tray or dish to facilitate air circulation and minimize the need for cleaning. Consider the thickness of the food when cooking, as this will influence cooking times and browning. Thoroughly preheat the oven before use, especially for items like toast. Regularly turn food as needed.

**Top Oven:**  
The top oven is designed for versatile cooking. Place food on the appropriate shelf and allow enough space for even heating. Preheat the oven before cooking; this ensures effective results. Always use the oven light to monitor progress without fully opening the door.

**Main Oven Heat Zones:**  
The main oven contains varying heat zones— the top is slightly hotter than the bottom. Familiarize yourself with these zones to optimize cooking, especially when using multiple racks. Preheat before cooking for best results.

**Cooking Charts:**  
Follow the provided cooking charts for various dishes, ensuring that the correct oven positions and approximate cooking times are observed. Utilize internal temperature guidance for meats to confirm doneness.

**Slow Cooking:**  
This method is effective for tougher cuts of meat, allowing them to become tender over time. Ensure food is adequately thawed and use the appropriate times for slow cooking, especially for items such as soups, casseroles, and stews.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**  
Always turn off and unplug the appliance before cleaning. Avoid using bleach-based cleaners as they can damage the finish. For the hob, clean the burners and hotplates with suitable cleaning solutions. Shelves, runners, and other accessories may also be washed in the dishwasher where applicable.

**Door Maintenance:**  
To clean between glass panels, carefully remove the outer glass and use appropriate cleaners. Ensure the glass is reinstalled correctly to prevent accidents.

**Replacing Light Bulbs:**  
If the oven light needs replacement, ensure the appliance is off and cool. Remove the cover and unscrew the old bulb before installing a new one.
