### Abstract

**DPE Transition from FC 55XX/57XX to FC 45XX**

The migration from DPE models 54XX/56XX to 45XX involves utilizing the Core Software, referred to as Licensed LIC, which is only authorized for EMC service personnel. Each DAE assembly includes SPS, and if the Access option is utilized, the corresponding Core Software will be accessed via CD-ROM, which may also be shared with switches.

### Core Software Compatibility

Users must be aware that the Core Software must be compatible with the revisions of Navisphere and ATF (Application Tool Framework) operating systems. For instance, if connecting to systems with versions earlier than the specified Core Software, it must be noted that the latest revisions are documented as New 5.32.XX and New 6.32.XX, which require accessing the information through the EMC URL provided.

### Procedures for Core Software Transition

To transition from DPE 54XX/56XX to 45XX, specific procedures apply concerning the Core Software or Service Pack. The software versions must correspond accurately to RAID configurations, ensuring that all LUNs are bound correctly as part of a RAID group. For Core Software above version 5.XX, RAID and LUN functionalities are impacted, and this information must be retrievable from the Core Software and Navisphere CD-ROMs.

### Installation and Configuration

In the process of installing Core Software, the selected options can influence the flashing status indicators on the device. Specifically for versions 5.3X or 6.3X, users should follow procedures to ensure that the DPE is powered down before making connections to the SPs. Memory configurations must be handled with ESD precautions, ensuring that slots and connectors are correctly oriented.

### Licensing and Copyright

This documentation, including the software referenced, is proprietary to EMC Corporation. All users are obligated to adhere to EMC's licensing terms when utilizing this software, which includes Navisphere and Access components. Compliance with copyright regulations is enforced, and all related materials are the intellectual property of their respective owners.

### Conclusion

Upon completing the configuration and ensuring that SP PROMs are updated, all indicators will signal readiness for operation. For any discrepancies, users must refer to the RMA Authorization procedures outlined.
