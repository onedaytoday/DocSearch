**English EMS2840 Overview:**

This microwave model offers three cooking options by combining traditional cooking with microwave functionality. To cook using the microwave, select the desired power level (450W, 600W, or 300W) using the Touch Control panel. Preheat the microwave as necessary and confirm settings by pressing the Stop/Clear button to exit.

**Defrosting:**

For defrosting, press the Defrost button, which automatically adjusts power to 180W. It's important to turn the food during defrosting to ensure even results.

To reheat chilled ready meals, press the Reheat button, then follow the instructions on the auto-cook selection chart. Adjust settings as needed and confirm by pressing Stop/Clear.

**Cooking Guidelines:**

Ensure all food is suitable for microwave cooking and is placed in appropriate containers.
