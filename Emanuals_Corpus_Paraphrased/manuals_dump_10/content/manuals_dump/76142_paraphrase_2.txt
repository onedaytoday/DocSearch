**Duct Preparation**: It's essential that ducts are installed correctly to prevent fire risks and to optimize appliance performance. Use straight ducts wherever feasible to enhance airflow. Avoid configurations that may restrict airflow such as tight bends or sharp angles.

---

**Cabinet Preparation**: Maintain appropriate clearances from heat sources to prevent fire hazards. Follow all specified dimensions to ensure safety.

---

**Installation Requirements**: Ensure that all installation standards comply with the National ANSI/NFPA codes. Verify that the electrical supply is properly grounded and secured against overload.

---

**Installing the Hood**: Mount temporary boards when positioning the hood and ensure that it is securely attached to the established framework. 

---

**Electrical Connection**: Prior to making electrical connections, ensure the power supply is disconnected. Confirm that the voltage matches the specifications found on the unit's nameplate. Follow proper grounding practices to ensure safety.

---

**Verifying Operation**: After installation, test the unit to confirm all functions, including lighting and blower operations. Switch the system ON to ensure everything runs smoothly. Adjust settings as necessary for optimal performance.
