To effectively deep clean and sanitize heavily soiled items such as towels and clothing, select the appropriate settings on your washing machine. It's advisable to use the internal heater set to a temperature of 60°C (140°F) or higher to enhance performance, particularly in minimizing bacteria transfer. Note that for optimal results, higher concentrations of bleach or specific chemicals may be required. 

This guidance abides by NSF International standards, which are pivotal for ensuring health and safety.

**Performance Features of Family-Sized Clothes Washers**

The heated internal system operates at a temperature of 60°C (140°F) for several hours, sufficient to eliminate bacteria. In case the heating process is interrupted, both the efficacy and temperature may be compromised. Ensure you set the machine accordingly to maintain the desired temperature.

**Status Display:** Displays current cycle status. Any imbalance triggers a warning on the display.

**Drum Light:** Automatically illuminates the drum whenever the door is opened, helping to monitor loads effectively.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Always clean the washer exterior with a damp cloth to prevent buildup. For an efficient washing machine, it’s crucial to regularly maintain the drum and cleaning components. Specifically, periodically run the "System Clean" cycle to eliminate any residue from previous washes.

**Stain Removal Guidance**

For effective stain removal:
- **Immediate Action:** Treat stains promptly following product instructions.
- **General Procedures:** Scrape or blot the stain before applying prewash or cleaning agents.

**Hazard Precautions:** Avoid combining bleach with certain cleaning agents to prevent harmful fumes and potential health risks.

**Regular Maintenance:** Clean the dispenser drawer and ensure all detachable parts are maintained for optimal performance.
