For an efficient and accurate installation process, please consult these straightforward instructions before you begin. Ensure that your installation adheres to relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes. Use these guidelines as a reference during installation.

It's common practice to ground electrical devices, such as telephones and computers, to water lines. This grounding may be either within the building or external to it. However, improper grounding can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, resulting in electrolytic reactions that impart a metallic taste and increase the water's metal content. To prevent this, it’s crucial to use the correct materials as specified.

Any drain fittings supplied by the installer should be constructed from plastic to ensure electrical isolation of the fountain from the building’s plumbing system. For the water inlet connection, ensure that the outer diameter (O.D.) unplated copper tubing is used to connect the cold water supply service stop (not provided). 

Please take note of the water flow direction and the recommended locations for the water supply and waste outlet, as illustrated. It's essential to reinforce the wall in the indicated shaded areas, and proper positioning of the fountain should align with ANSI A117.0 standards. 

The installation process involves securely assembling the parts using appropriate type screws and washers. Be careful to avoid soldering tubes inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. These products are designed to operate at specific pressure levels; do not supply water at pressures exceeding the specified limits, as doing so may void the warranty.

Stream height adjustments should be made carefully, using a screwdriver to turn the adjustment screw clockwise or counter-clockwise as needed. For the water cooler activation, only lead-free components should be utilized with necessary precautions taken to meet all outlined specifications.

For parts inquiries, please consult your local distributor or contact Elkay Manufacturing Company. When installing replacement components, ensure that nuts are tightened just enough to hold parts snugly in position without over-tightening.

Refer to the parts list for component details and specify part numbers as needed.
