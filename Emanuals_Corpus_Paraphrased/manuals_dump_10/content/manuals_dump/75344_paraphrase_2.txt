### Operation Overview

The internal cooling process functions to maintain optimal operation. The selection of the cooking function can be managed through the top cavity controls, allowing you to choose settings conveniently. Once the desired function is confirmed, it will preheat to 80°C. To deactivate this function, simply press the button once. As the temperature is reached, an indicator light will illuminate and an audible signal will signify that the heating has ceased.

Additionally, there is a Defrost function for items requiring gradual heating, such as frozen food. This function allows you to defrost meals without opening the door, enabling cooking to commence smoothly once the process is complete. The system provides versatility for other applications like Gratin and top cooking.

### Usage Guidelines

When loading the shelves, ensure they are positioned straight and pushed toward the back. Verify that the front is devoid of any obstacles to facilitate heat circulation. **CAUTION:** Supervise young children around the appliance and ensure they do not access the cooking section while in operation.

To switch on the cooking function, press the appropriate button on the cavity control. The display will show your selection, which can be confirmed after a few seconds. If the set temperature of 250°C is reached, the function will automatically terminate. The corresponding indicator light will activate accordingly.

### Preheating and Cooking

Preheating enhances the cooking process. It is advisable to preheat if you are preparing items like ready meals. When batch cooking, a temperature reduction of approximately 20°C to 25°C from the recommendation might be necessary. 

Follow the designated cooking chart for specific recommendations, such as cooking times and temperatures. For items that are typically iced or frosted, consult the cooking functions outlined.

### Child Safety Features

To activate child safety mode, press the designated controls until “SAFE” appears on the display. This will prevent any unintended usage of the appliance. To disable child lock, press the selector again until “SAFE” is cleared. While in this mode, the appliance will not operate until reset.

### Cooking Charts

Consult the various cooking charts to guide you on cooking times, temperatures, and shelf placements for different types of food. Adjustments may be necessary based on individual recipes and ingredient thicknesses. 

### Roasting Guidelines

For roasting meats, maintain a temperature range of 160°C to 180°C. Ensure to check internal temperatures for proper doneness, following the recommended cooking times to achieve the best results.

Overall, adherence to these operational and safety guidelines will ensure a seamless cooking experience.

### Cooking Guidelines

When using the oven, ensure you arrange food in a way that allows for optimal heat distribution, which can help achieve desired thicknesses and browning. Preheat the oven to the required temperature, such as 'high', before placing food inside. It is essential to position food centrally on the shelf directly beneath the heating element, monitoring cooking progress and turning food as needed.

### Shelf Arrangement

Shelves are numbered from the bottom upwards. For optimal results, ensure there is sufficient space above the food for heat circulation, especially when cooking items like Yorkshire pudding or cakes. Maintain a clean environment by allowing space around dishes to reduce the need for extensive cleaning post-cooking.

### Cooking Materials

Use preferred cookware, such as enamelware or heavy-duty materials, to enhance browning and ensure even cooking. Non-stick finishes can also improve heat conduction, contributing to a more effective cooking process.

### Defrosting Instructions

For proper defrosting, place food in a cooler environment, allowing it to thaw gradually. The defrosting time varies based on the type of meat and thickness; typically, smaller cuts require fewer hours. Once defrosted, cook food immediately to ensure food safety.

### Troubleshooting and Maintenance

If issues arise during cooking, allow the appliance to cool down and check connections. Ensure that all operation instructions have been closely followed. If the appliance is not functioning correctly, there may be issues with the mechanical components or electrical supply.

For effective cleaning, switch off the electricity supply and allow cooling before cleaning the appliance. Use appropriate cleaning agents that do not damage the finish. Manual cleaning is often necessary for shelves; some may be dishwasher safe, depending on their material.

### Technical Specifications

The appliance must comply with applicable electrical standards, ensuring proper grounding to prevent hazards. Review the electrical rating plate located on the appliance to confirm specifications. 

Ensure connections are secure and follow local electrical codes, particularly when installing new appliances. Use PVC insulated cables rated for specific electrical requirements, promoting safety and efficiency.
