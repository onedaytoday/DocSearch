### Technical Documentation on Touchmonitor Specifications

#### Phase and Refresh Rate Configuration
The refresh phase of the LCD and clock settings should be synchronized to the VGA input, ensuring a secure connection with the LCD touchmonitor. The LCD touchmonitor typically operates at 15-inch XGA resolution; this is important when transitioning from VGA to SVGA to XGA inputs. The native resolution and refresh characteristics of the LCD must be matched for optimal performance.

#### Compatibility and Input Configuration
To effectively utilize different input formats (VGA, SVGA, XGA), the corresponding resolutions and refresh rates should align accurately with the specifications of the LCD. If the resolution exceeds the touchmonitor's capabilities, artifacts may appear, affecting display quality. These artifacts can include issues with character representation.
