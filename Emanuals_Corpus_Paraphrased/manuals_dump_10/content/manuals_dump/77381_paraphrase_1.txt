   B. Apply light grease on the threads and carefully screw on the cover.

3. **Oil Pressure Adjustment Assembly**:  
   A. Located in the front housing, this assembly features a machined seat that requires adjustment. Turn the adjusting screw counter-clockwise to modify the bypass.  
   B. Upon reassembly, clean the contacting surfaces and ensure the washers are in place before securing the assembly.

4. **Tri-Micro Oil Filter Service**:  
   A. Begin by loosening the screws on the front housing to access the oil filter. Ensure a clean area and that all debris is cleared from the assembly.  
   B. Apply fresh oil during reassembly and allow components to settle before tightening screws.

5. **Oil Pump Assembly**:  
   A. To disassemble, first remove the necessary screws from the housing. Inspect the seal and clean as needed. Each component must be re-centered before reinstallation.  
   B. Ensure the pump is lubricated, and examine the hydraulic connections carefully.

6. **Preparation for Internal Servicing**:  
   A. Disconnect the electrical heater and remove the cover to access internal components. Carefully inspect for any damages or burrs that might impede reassembly.  
   B. Apply a light layer of grease to both the heater cover and body for a smooth fit.

7. **Crankshaft Seal**:  
   A. Check the crankshaft seal for wear. Cleaning and maintenance are essential to extend the seal's life.  
   B. Inspect the connecting components to ensure proper fit; any deemed damaged should be replaced.

8. **Connecting Rods and Pistons**:  
   A. Carefully remove the covers, noting the assembly order. Thoroughly clean all parts prior to reassembly.  
   B. Upon reassembly, ensure that bearings are properly seated; they should move smoothly without excessive force.

**Caution**: Inspect the bearings closely for signs of wear. If damaged, replace them to prevent operational issues. 

**Final Note**: Adhere to the specified torque values during reassembly to ensure reliability in the compressor's function. Regular inspection and maintenance will promote longevity and efficiency.

### B. Reassembly

#### Connecting

To begin the reassembly process, refer to the Piston Ring Dimensions Table for guidance on the specific dimensions and tolerances for the compression and oil rings. Ensure that the rings are correctly oriented with the specified notches aligned as shown in the figures provided. The rings should be securely pulled together and locked in place, allowing for smooth operation of the crankshaft.

Take care when reassembling parts, as each component must be carefully aligned and seated according to the instructions. It is crucial to ensure that the assembly is checked for any obstructions, especially within the suction chamber, prior to finalizing the assembly.

When installing cylinder liners, use the appropriate tools to ensure a proper fit and orientation, following the guidelines for any necessary modifications to the crankshaft assembly.

#### Crankshaft

To remove the crankshaft, begin by detaching it from the front housing and carefully unscrewing any threaded screws securing it in place. Be cautious of any components that may obstruct the removal process and ensure the bearings are free to facilitate the disassembly.

After the crankshaft is detached from the front housing, ensure that it is cleaned thoroughly to remove any contaminants. The final assembly requires that the crankshaft is positioned correctly within its housing, and following the specified torque settings is essential for optimal performance.
