**Important Safety Information**

For models such as the CineTension2 and VMAX, note that these screens feature overheat protection. If the system shuts off due to overheating, allow it to cool down before further operation. Avoid making repairs yourself to prevent voiding the warranty. Keep the area around the screen free from obstructions, and refer to the remote IR instructions carefully. To prevent risks such as electric shock or fire hazards, ensure that the power cord is secured and protected from elements like wind or UV radiation.

**Operation and Compliance**

This device complies with FCC Class standards, ensuring reasonable protection against interference. Should you experience any disruption in reception, try the following: Turn off the device and check the connections; adjusting the location of either the transmitter or the receiver may improve performance.

**Screen Operation**

With the built-in 12V input, the screen can be controlled via IR (Infrared) and RF (Radio Frequency) receivers. The IR receiver needs a direct line of sight, while the RF receiver does not require this. Use the 5-12V IR switch to operate the screen without obstructions, and be aware that IR signals should not be concealed.

Refer to the tables provided for specific model dimensions and ratios, such as FE72V, FE84V, and FE100V, among others. These measurements are for reference and may vary slightly.
