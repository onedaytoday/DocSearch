### Getting Familiar with Your Oven
Familiarize yourself with the oven controls, including the cooling fan, which operates automatically when the oven is switched on or off.

### Cooking Tips
Ensure even cooking by adjusting food placement according to thickness and type for optimal results. Clean as needed, particularly if splatters occur during cooking. 

For further assistance or to order parts, contact the service center directly.

### Preheating and Cooking Instructions

**Preheat the Oven:** Adjust the oven to the desired heat setting. Ensure food is positioned centrally and directly beneath the heating elements to ensure even cooking. Refer to the Service Force Grilling Chart for specific cooking times.

**Using the Second Oven:** This oven heats from the top, making it suitable for baking cakes and similar items at a temperature of 100°C.

**Important Notes:** 
1. The oven will indicate when it has reached the set temperature by switching on and off, signaling its operational status.
2. Ensure that the food and dishes are placed appropriately to allow for heat circulation, thereby reducing cleaning requirements.

**Shelf Configuration in the Second Oven:** 
- The shelves should be adjusted to lie flat and positioned at the back. Ensure the front is clear for easy access. There should be adequate spacing to promote even cooking.

**Hints and Tips:**
- Maintain spacing between dishes to facilitate better airflow and ensure proper cooking. Avoid placing cookware or rough materials that can obstruct heat distribution.
- Heavy or polished surfaces can enhance browning.

### Oven Cooking Charts

**Main Fan Oven:**
- Preheating is essential for optimal cooking. Without it, cooking efficiency and final temperature might not meet recommendations.
- Use the cooking temperature guidelines, adjusting down by 20°C-25°C for various food types.

**Conventional Oven:**
- Designed for cooking without a fan. It is ideal for dishes requiring top browning.

- **Roasting Chart:** Consult the roasting guide for internal temperature guidelines to achieve the best results.

### Pizza Function:
This setting allows for thorough cooking of pizza and similar items.

### Speedcook Function:
This function enables cooking without preheating, although it requires adherence to specific cooking times.

### Thermal Grilling:
This method integrates top heat with circulation around food, allowing for efficient cooking. It combines the benefits of grilling while working with a closed lid.

By following these guidelines and charts, you can optimize your cooking results. Make adjustments based on your specific oven model and preferences.

**DEFROSTING**

The defrosting function allows for thawing food without applying heat, using surrounding air instead. This feature is ideal for items that may be covered in ice or frost. 

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

The defrosting process begins and ends when the respective operation light is activated. The cooling efficiency can be influenced by the temperature of the surrounding environment. For optimal results, it's advisable to defrost meat using this function rather than thin cuts, which can take hours to thaw. 

Immediately cook food once it's been defrosted, and never refreeze items that have already thawed. Always adhere to food safety guidelines to prevent bacterial growth during cooling, reheating, and defrosting.

**HELPFUL TIPS FOR PURCHASING AND PREPARING FOOD**

When sourcing food, prioritize the 'freshest' options and deliver them quickly to minimize bacterial exposure. Follow cooking instructions carefully to ensure thorough heating. For meat, a thermometer should be used to verify that internal temperatures reach safe levels (60°C, 70°C, 80°C) as per safety guidelines. 

**CARE AND CLEANING**

**OVEN MAINTENANCE**

Before cleaning, allow the oven to cool down, ensuring the cooling fan has completed its cycle. Avoid using harsh cleaning materials that contain bleach, as they can damage finishes. For the exterior, use a cloth and appropriate cleaner based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.

**CLEANING THE INTERIOR**

The interior oven surfaces, including the Stayclean coated areas, require manual cleaning. While Stayclean surfaces are self-cleaning up to 220°C, they should not be neglected; follow instructions to prevent build-up that impairs performance.

**CLEANING DOOR GLASS**

Use a designated cleaning solution for the inner glass panel, taking care to avoid damaging the assembly. If the glass gets chipped or scratched, consult a service professional to mitigate safety risks.

**REPLACING COMPONENTS**

Oven shelves and interior parts can often be cleaned in a dishwasher or manually, depending on their condition. Always disconnect the electricity supply for safety when replacing components like light bulbs.

**TROUBLESHOOTING**

For issues with the oven, ensure that it's plugged in and correctly set, and verify that the cooling processes are functioning. If problems persist, contact service support for guidance.

**SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS**

For service inquiries or to purchase parts, contact Service Force. For more information, visit their website or consult the customer care department for warranty questions.
