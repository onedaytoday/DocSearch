### Food Cooling and FROSTMATIC Functionality Guidelines

To optimize food preservation, allow food to cool before placing it in storage. This minimizes warmth, which can lead to increased frost formation and potential spoilage.

**Using the FROSTMATIC Function:**
The FROSTMATIC feature enables rapid cooling of cooked items. It is recommended to activate this function for a designated period, typically between 4 to 24 hours, after which the function will automatically turn off. A yellow indicator light will signify when this function is active. You can also deactivate FROSTMATIC manually if needed, but once turned off, the appliance will return to its previous settings.

**Tips for Effective Cooling:**
1. Wrap food in airtight materials to prevent flavor transfer and freezer burn.
2. Ensure that items are stored in a way that promotes quick cooling, as thicker layers of food may require longer cooling times.

**Ice Cube Preparation:**
When preparing ice cubes, ensure to check the machine every few seconds to prevent overflows or blockages from frost.

**Defrosting Procedures:**
To maintain optimal appliance performance, regularly defrost the unit when frost buildup exceeds a specific thickness. It is important to follow the manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations for defrosting.

**Warnings:**
1. Never use heating elements or non-recommended mechanical devices during defrosting as this may lead to health hazards or equipment damage.
2. Ensure proper safety procedures are followed when cleaning the appliance to avoid electric shock. Always switch off the device before cleaning.

**Cleaning Protocol:**
1. Turn off the FROSTMATIC function and disconnect the appliance from the power supply.
2. Clean the interior and surfaces using appropriate cleaning agents to avoid damage.
3. Periodically check for frost buildup and maintain cleanliness for efficient operation.
