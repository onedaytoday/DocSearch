**ENGLISH**

Choose the appropriate type and configuration to use with the specified components. If needed, turn off the device immediately before servicing it. Ensure that the system is powered down to prevent injury during maintenance. It is essential to follow the technical specifications carefully and wear protective gear as needed.

To adjust the housing, begin by removing the four screws. Position the components correctly, ensuring that the cover fits securely. If adjustments to the wheel tracking are required, lock it in place by turning clockwise. To loosen, turn it counterclockwise. Tighten the locking mechanism as needed, following the directional arrows.

The assembly consists of thrust bearings located at the rear, which should be adjusted easily. Ensure the screws are aligned properly by turning them clockwise until they make contact. It is important to utilize the correct wrench for tightening.

When mounting the table, if the housing becomes dirty or damaged, clean it thoroughly using appropriate cleaning agents. The ON/OFF switch should always be guarded to prevent unauthorized access or accidental activation.

If any troubleshooting is necessary—such as when a relay trips or if there’s an overheating issue—power off the device, allow it to cool, and check for the correct phase connection. During initial operation, ensure that all components are correctly mounted to prevent malfunction.
