Overall, follow the prompts through the menu to efficiently manage your audio and video settings, ensuring optimal performance from your connected devices.

The Advanced MCACC system allows users to select various configurations for sound adjustments. To initiate, choose the MCACC ALL option (recommended) or the EQ S-Wave setting. This enables three distinct correction processes which are stored in the MCACC memory, ensuring symmetrical adjustments for both left and right channels. The ALL CH ADJ function allows for individual calibration of front speakers and aligns them based on THX standards. When prompted, select YES THX for SMALL speakers; otherwise, opt for NO.

The STAND.WAVE EQ S-Wave function analyzes reference tones, aiding in the calibration of the microphone for balanced seating, as indicated on the on-screen display. Users can select ALL or SP to specify the characteristics—this process ensures that adjustments are appropriately measured and saved. The Professional EQ feature can also be invoked when SP or EQ S-Wave is active, providing additional acoustic corrections.

To set up the microphone, ensure it's positioned appropriately at ear level, and follow the displayed instructions during the MCACC process. If any discrepancies arise (shown as ERR messages), users can choose to RETRY or proceed through the menus accordingly. For optimal performance, the microphone should be connected properly, and surrounding sounds must be controlled to avoid interference.

Advanced settings like the Acoustic EQ Professional optimize sound by adjusting frequencies to match reference tones. This system allows for dynamic adjustments based on individual room characteristics. Users can manage sound levels for various channels and ensure a precise match to the reference outputs. After completing adjustments, the system should effectively play surround sound, enhancing overall listening experiences.

In summary, the Advanced MCACC is designed to streamline the calibration process for optimal audio performance, utilizing sophisticated settings that adapt to specific acoustics and user preferences.

Additionally, THX-specific adjustments can be made to ensure optimal sound performance when using surround back channels.  

**Final Notes**  
Configure your front and surround speakers effectively by selecting LARGE or SMALL settings as needed, which influences bass distribution. Follow on-screen instructions to ensure proper acoustics for an enhanced listening experience.

### Surround Sound Setup Guide

To optimize surround sound, select "LARGE" for the bass output from the subwoofer and rear speakers effectively. Choose "SMALL" to redirect bass to other speakers or select "NO" if you want to bypass rear speakers entirely. If you select "NO," the subwoofer will handle the bass. When "YES" is chosen, the bass settings for "SMALL" will apply.

To enhance bass performance further, use "PLUS" to ensure consistent bass output, redirecting lower frequencies typically designated for front speakers to the subwoofer. Conversely, if "NO" is selected, bass will not funnel to other speakers.

For sound setups using MCACC or THX, make sure to adjust according to the speaker configuration, considering their capabilities and characteristics. For users with THX enabled receivers, be ready to specify whether surround back is manually or automatically configured, and adjust the boundary settings appropriately if the subwoofer is not THX Select2 certified.

### Network Configuration

Access the network settings through the GUI by pressing the HOME MENU. Configure your IP address and proxy settings as needed. Ensure DHCP is turned ON if connected to a broadband router, or manually input details if DHCP is not available.

### HDMI and Bluetooth Integration

The HDMI functions and Bluetooth operations can be configured via the GUI. Depending on your setup, specify options for automatic or manual device recognition. You may also enable or disable reduction settings that manage sound output levels, ensuring the optimal listening experience.

### Speaker Positioning and Calibration

For ideal sound positioning, ensure speakers are symmetrically placed and maintain at least 10 inches from walls for optimal acoustics. Utilize the MCACC function to achieve steady calibration and maintain the height of the speakers in line with ear level for better sound clarity. Adjustments made during testing may include repositioning to eliminate cramped sound fields.

If utilizing a subwoofer, ensure it is positioned correctly for aligning bass frequencies cohesively with other speakers. Regularly check and fine-tune settings to achieve a balanced acoustic environment for diverse audio scenarios.
