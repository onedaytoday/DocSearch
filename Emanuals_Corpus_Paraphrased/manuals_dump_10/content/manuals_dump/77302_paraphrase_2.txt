**Troubleshooting Guide: Problem Causes and Remedies**

When the switch is turned on, if the internal fuse is blown, a qualified service technician should be contacted for replacement. If the amplifier is incorrectly connected, it can lead to improper sound output. The DAB-50 should be able to find both DAB and FM stations. If the correct information isn't displayed, ensure that the proper selection has been made in the CONTROL/TUNING section, as you may need to cycle through options to find your chosen station.

If you experience unusual sounds or whistling, verify that the volume is set appropriately. Refer to the TROUBLESHOOTING section for detailed guidance.

For technical specifications, please consult the RF section, DAB III, and FM character types, as well as the LED backlight and SPDIF details conforming to IEC60958 standards. Additional technical data is available without needing further clarification.
