### Meat Oven Functions and Usage

**Roasting Function:**  
Utilize the Rotitherm feature for cooking meats and poultry, taking into account the thickness of the items. Ensure the oven is pre-heated following the recommended time. The first shelf position is ideal for optimal cooking results.

**Defrosting Function:**  
For defrosting, remove food from packaging and place it on the shelf. Avoid covering it in a way that may slow the process. Rotate items such as meat, trout, or cream slightly during defrosting for even results.

**Drying Function:**  
Enable convection heating with shelves lined with greaseproof paper. Allow food, such as beans, mushrooms, apricots, and pears, to cool overnight after drying.

**Preservation Function:**  
Use the appropriate jars for preservation, ensuring there is enough space between items for even processing. Switch the setting to preserve to 100Â°C, ensuring items are not touching.

Before cleaning, ensure the oven is switched off and cooled down. Use appropriate cleaners to avoid damage, and refrain from using abrasive materials that may scratch surfaces. Clean the interior and each shelf with a soft cloth.

**Removing Shelves:**  
To remove shelves, pull them out from the front and lift them at the back. Clean each shelf separately and handle them carefully to avoid scratches.
