When positioning the hose for coating application, ensure it doesn’t get obstructed by coal-burning materials or freeze in temperatures below 0°C. The hose should be connected to the supply properly to avoid breakdowns. It’s important to fix the hose securely and to ensure it is correctly threaded. If necessary, extend the hose appropriately; if it gets too long, consider purchasing a hose designed for this application that complies with local building codes.

The hose must also include a water-stop feature to prevent damage, as indicated in the section "Technical Water-stop." Be sure to position the hose branch at least above the ground for proper ventilation. Refer to the rating plate on the hose to verify that it meets required specifications. 

WARNING! Always ensure that the hose is properly grounded, and remember that compliance with safety regulations is critical. If repairs or replacements are needed, treat the hose as a household item for recycling purposes. For any questions regarding proper disposal or services, consult the location where it was purchased or refer to the recycling information provided. These instructions should be followed to ensure safe usage.

Additionally, make sure to wash items before loading them, ensuring that they are treated correctly for optimal results.
