**(EWT806 and EWT606)**

Congratulations on your choice to utilize the EWT806 and EWT606 models. For optimal performance, ensure that the machine is operated correctly by following the provided instructions carefully. This document serves as a reference for owners, detailing important warnings and information about the washing features.

If you encounter issues with washing, such as residue build-up or clothes becoming stained or yellowed, please refer to the instructions regarding water options, bleach usage, and cleaning processes. The washer is designed to handle various loads effectively and includes multiple settings for optimizing wash results.

To operate the machine safely, be aware of warning labels and ensure children are supervised around it. Always turn off the machine when not in use, and contact authorized service support if technical issues arise.

The new features of these models allow you to customize wash settings based on the load type and soil level. Using the correct water and active settings can help save money on utilities while ensuring your garments are cleaned thoroughly. If you've used a top-load washer previously, remember that this model operates differently to accommodate various fabric types and soil levels.

In terms of operation, the washer's cycle involves a series of rinses and rests to effectively clean clothes and minimize detergent residue. Options can be manually adjusted to fit your specific needs, allowing flexibility based on load characteristics. 

The washer’s technology monitors the amount of clothing loaded, ensuring an efficient wash without overloading. If clothes need redistribution during the cycle, the machine will signal adjustments to maintain performance. 

Be sure to sort clothes by fabric type prior to washing—separating items like corduroy, synthetics, and delicate fabrics to avoid damage. Follow pre-treatment instructions for stains as needed.

Measure load amounts according to the guidelines to prevent overloading and ensure proper function. When using bleach, adhere to provided instructions carefully to avoid damaging fabrics, and opt for the recommended bleach type.

For a range of fabric care options, select settings like Normal, Heavy, or Light based on your load's needs. This creates an efficient washing experience tailored to various types of clothing. 

Finally, if you have questions about the machine or require assistance, reference the detailed guides included for clarity on operating procedures and maintenance recommendations.

The operation process involves selecting options for washing different types of clothing. You can choose heavy items or lighter fabrics to refresh them. Use the provided controls to adjust settings based on your selection. Specific instructions inform you on water temperature and duration, helping you decide on the right cycle for the clothing. If you're unsure which option to select, the system displays the recommended settings based on the clothing type.

When starting the process, ensure the selected garment quantity matches the machine's capacity. If the amount is excessive or too low, it may not operate correctly. Ensure the lid is properly closed and locked before proceeding. The system will indicate various stages of operation with visual prompts.

When activating the wash, you can choose between different washing settings, including gentle cycles for delicate fabrics. You have the option to wash clothes separately or together, depending on their fabric types. If items begin to accumulate dirt or detergent residue, regular cleaning and maintenance are advised.

For optimal performance, inspect garments for stains before washing, and treat them as necessary. Using appropriate cleaning agents and techniques is crucial to avoid fabric damage. 

Ensure that chemicals used for washing, such as bleach or stain removers, are safe for the fabric types. For stubborn stains, use specific cleaning methods relevant to the substance causing the stain, and follow care labels on clothing items closely.

Regular maintenance of the washing machine is essential, including cleaning around and inside the machine to remove any buildup that could affect performance. Always refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for specific cleaning products and techniques suitable for your washer.
