Certainly! Here's a paraphrased version of the text, maintaining its technical context and meaning:

For stubborn stains, it is recommended to treat fabric with a cloth and appropriate grease removal agents, either warm or cold. For white and colored fabrics, use bleach carefully. Lipstick stains should be treated with bleach on white fabrics specifically. It's essential to differentiate between various washing methods based on the fabric type, and a prewash may be required for heavily soiled items. 

The washer settings should be adjusted according to the type of material. For optimal results, water temperatures typically range from 30°C to 95°C, depending on the fabric. When washing synthetic items, consider using a prewash option for heavily soiled fabrics.

Regular maintenance of the appliance is crucial—ensure the filter and catch are clean to avoid blockages. Disconnect the machine from the power supply before cleaning or servicing. For safety, ensure hoses are properly secured and not kinked. 

If the machine indicates a malfunction (e.g., E10, E20, E40 errors), review operation guidelines and contact service for troubleshooting. Clean the hoses regularly to maintain optimal performance.

Position hoses according to the installation guidelines to prevent obstructions and ensure efficient drainage. Use hoses compliant with local authority regulations for plumbing connections, ensuring they’re securely attached and appropriately routed.

Finally, avoid placing carpets around the appliance to prevent potential damage and facilitate a safe working environment. Properly manage any excess hoses to keep them organized and avoid wear.
