**Safety Information**

Please read the following instructions carefully to ensure safe operation. 

- **WARNING**: To minimize the risk of electric shock or fire, always comply with the instructions below. Neglecting these could lead to serious injury or death: 
    - Do not wash items that have been treated with flammable substances or greasy items that may cause hazards.
    - Be cautious of hydrogen gas, which is explosive when mixed with debris. 
    - Always keep children away from the washer and prevent access when unpacking it. 

**Installation Instructions**

Ensure the washer is properly grounded to avoid electrical hazards and potential injury. Use appropriate installation methods to prevent shocks or serious accidents. 

**Operational Guidelines**

When operating the washer, please ensure to:

- Sort laundry according to color and fabric type to enhance washing efficiency.
- Avoid overloading, as tightly packed items may impede performance.
- Use only low-sudsing, high-efficiency detergents, and follow dosage instructions carefully.

**Sounds During Operation**

Be aware of typical operational sounds including:

- **Drain Hose**: Water movement through the drain hose is normal.
- **Water Valves/Dispenser**: A slight sound during water intake is expected.
- **Door Lock**: You may hear a clicking sound indicating a secure door.
- **Drain Pump**: High-velocity sounds while draining are typical.
- **High-Speed Motor**: Sounds corresponding to various cycles are part of normal operation.

**Loading Recommendations**

When loading the washer, maintain separation between heavy and light items, as well as between different fabric types. Ensure items are free from embellishments that could lead to further complications.

**Detergent and Bleach Instructions**

Use bleach sparingly—never exceed recommended amounts, and always add it to the correct chamber. Avoid pouring bleach directly into the drum.

**Program Selection**

Choose the appropriate washing cycle by adjusting options on the control panel. Refer to the instruction guide for specifics on cycle capabilities to ensure proper selection.

**Caution**

Do not attempt to force items through the door while a cycle is in progress, as this poses an entrapment risk. 

For troubleshooting or specific operational questions, consult the provided resources or get in touch with a qualified technician. Thank you for trusting us with your laundry needs.

**Selection and Cleaning Instructions**

To ensure a thorough cleaning, it is essential to select the Deep Clean or Sanitize cycles for heavily soiled items like towels and clothing. It is recommended that the internal heater be set to 60°C (140°F) or higher to effectively eliminate bacterial loads. Use bleach or other specialized chemicals as required. 

**Note:** This machine has been tested by NSF International to meet health and safety standards, specifically NSF P172 regarding the performance of family-sized washers.

The internal heater will maintain the set temperature, and during the heating phase, cold water may initially enter, resulting in lower temperatures. The washer resumes to the set temperature once it stabilizes at 60°C (140°F). 

Select the proper wash cycle based on the fabric type: for example, use Casual for light items and Colors for delicate materials. This is especially crucial for individuals with allergies or asthma. 

**Rinse and Spin**: It’s vital to use the Rinse and Spin option to ensure a rinse of the chamber, particularly when using heavy sanitizing settings.

**Specialty Cycles**: To access Specialty Cycles, press the appropriate button on the LCD display. Specialty settings include Jeans and other cycles designed to minimize bacterial presence.

For stuffed animals and toys, ensure they are securely closed in a laundry bag to prevent tangling and allow for thorough sanitation. 

**Clean Washer Cycle**: To maintain the performance of your washer, run a Clean Washer cycle as prompted. Regular cleaning prevents odor buildup and ensures optimal functionality.

**General Guidelines**: Use lighter cycles for synthetic and colored items and refer to the chart for selecting the correct cycle based on fabric weight. Regularly check detergent levels to avoid overflow and imbalance during washes.

Please remember to adhere to safety precautions when handling cleaning products. Follow instructions to prevent mishaps, and avoid mixing bleach with other chemicals to minimize hazardous reactions.

**Stain Treatment**: For effective stain removal, treat stains promptly with prewash settings. Use specific treatments for different types of stains, being mindful of any product incompatibility to avoid damage to fabrics.

Should you encounter issues like excessive suds or unbalanced loads, the washer will display relevant notifications to guide you in rectifying these conditions.

By following these guidelines and selections carefully, you can maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of your washing machine while ensuring the cleanliness of your laundry.

### Cleaning Routine

**Preventative Cleaning**

For safety, ensure that children are kept away from the washer to avoid entrapment or tip-over hazards. To maintain the washer's freshness, perform the **Clean Washer** cycle at least once a month. Follow the instructions provided, either responding to prompts or manually initiating the **Clean Washer** process as needed.

**Important Note**: Always remove all items from the wash drum before starting the **Clean Washer** cycle. Use only liquid bleach or the recommended TIDE Washing Machine Cleaner, but never both. If bleach is used, ensure the **Remove Liquid Only** dispenser cup is cleared prior to use to avoid harmful vapors, especially when mixed with other household cleaners.

Additionally, clean the dispenser drawer area once a month. Remove any buildup from the prewash and bleach compartments, ensuring that all residues are cleaned through the recesses.

**Daily Preventative Maintenance**: Regularly check for and remove any items left in the washer. Maintain proper organization to prevent overloading and damage. Always keep the washer area clean, using household cleaner as necessary.

For more persistent issues such as mold or odor, follow the designated cleaning procedures as described earlier. If using bleach or a bleach cleaner, ensure to perform the **Clean Washer** cycle afterward for optimal results.

**Routine Maintenance**: After completing the cleaning processes, wipe down the top and exterior surfaces of the washer, and detach any supply hoses for thorough cleaning. If staining occurs, consider using bleach or specific stain removal products.

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Possible Cause:** Unbalanced load or improper installation.

**Problem:** Water Issues  
- **Possible Cause:** Clogged hoses or inadequate water supply.
