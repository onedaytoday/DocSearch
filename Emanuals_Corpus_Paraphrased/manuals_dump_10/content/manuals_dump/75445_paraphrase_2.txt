**Installation and Service Requirements:**  
Only qualified installers should carry out installation and maintenance. **Note:** Retain this document for local electrical inspections and future reference. Follow all relevant codes and regulations to prevent hazards such as fire or property damage. **Safety Notice:** If you detect a gas odor, immediately turn off the gas supply and evacuate the premises. Contact your neighbor for assistance and follow emergency protocols.

**Gas Range Installation Guidelines:**  
Ensure proper clearances between the range and surrounding walls (noted as height, width, and depth specifications). Protective coverings must withstand heat and comply with national standards. 

For safety, ensure the installation is done in accordance with ANSI/NFPA guidelines and that all electrical connections are properly grounded. The range features a non-removable cooktop, and users should reference specified cleaning procedures. 

**Grounding Instructions:**  
It’s crucial that this appliance is correctly grounded to prevent shock. A preferred grounding method involves using a three-prong plug connected to a grounded outlet. 

Make sure to locate the gas shutoff valve within easy access. Regular maintenance should be performed to avoid gas leaks. Note that if you are converting from natural gas to propane, follow the conversion instructions carefully, as improper installation can lead to significant risks.

When operating the range, ensure the area is free of flammable materials, and familiarize yourself with all shutoff and operational protocols to maintain safety during use. 

For lighting the burners, follow the procedure closely, ensuring the gas supply is purged before ignition to avoid flare-ups. If adjustments to flame height are necessary, utilize a screwdriver to make these changes, always turning in the direction that maintains the flame without extinguishing it.

Continually refer back to these guidelines for safe and effective operation of your gas range.

Here is a paraphrased version of the provided text in a clear and technical manner:

Ensure proper installation of the gas range by following these guidelines. When the thermostat activates, it triggers the heating element to turn on, and once the temperature reaches the set level, it will turn off after a few seconds, indicating "OFF." The range should be pre-set to 300°F per the operating instructions. If necessary, adjust the heat settings by utilizing the appropriate screws located at the rear and front of the unit. 

Take precautions to minimize the risk of injury or damage during installation. Follow the outlined steps meticulously to determine the correct placement of the range, including necessary tools such as a screwdriver and wrench. The range's mounting template should be used to establish precise screw locations on the wall. 

For safety, ensure that any gas odors are addressed immediately, and refer to local codes and regulations. Installation should only be performed by a qualified technician. Retain these instructions for future reference and consult the service numbers provided for any assistance.

Important safety instructions include adherence to ANSI Z223.1, NFPA, and CSA guidelines to ensure correct installation and operation of the range. 

For LP/Propane gas conversions, additional instructions are provided elsewhere in the manual.
