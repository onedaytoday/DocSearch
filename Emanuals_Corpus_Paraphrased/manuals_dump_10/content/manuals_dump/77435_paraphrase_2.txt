Here’s a technical paraphrase of the text:

The system permits the selection of either non-latching or latching operations for the high relay, with options exceeding that of the ST1400. The status of the high relay is displayed, and users can acknowledge their selection by pressing the switch/CAL/RESET. Note that if the relay status is not confirmed, repeated prompts will indicate the need for acknowledgment, shown by a flashing selection. Users should follow protocols for clearing and initializing the high relay functions.

To initiate operations, the UNI-TRAN device can activate using either an external switch or an internal push-button. The system then utilizes an LED indicator to confirm clean air application.

Initially, the detector must be positioned in its operational environment for at least a few hours to ensure accurate readings. The calibration sequence requires confirmation of an O2 input via a designated LED display confirming zero air flow. If zero air is not applied correctly, the system will prompt users to initiate recalibration procedures.

If the LED indicator flashes red and green, this signifies a fault. Users should repeat the previous steps or follow alternate procedures for proper functioning. When selecting options from the detector, users must acknowledge their choices with a YES prompt, and the system will help guide the operation.

In cases where an incorrect input is detected, operators may see an LED flash indicating an error, prompting them to correct the input and proceed with established protocols. The system allows for various relay configurations, including both latching and non-latching options.

Overall, the UNI-TRAN device requires consistent monitoring of its operation status through the internal diagnostics and LED indicators, ensuring the reliable functionality of all connected devices. For troubleshooting and performance evaluations, users are encouraged to consult specific chapters outlined in the operational manual.

The Light The Detector features four LED indicators and operates through a cover-activated switch. This switch, when engaged, enables the Detector. Activating the switch resets the Detector, allowing a second activation for monitoring. Connection leads from the relay should conform to specifications: the relay needs to be an SPDT type rated for either DC or AC use. Both relays are normally open and normally closed. Upon activation, the relay responds to detected conditions, and its performance is determined by factory settings. The relay may be configured for either isolated or non-isolated output, depending on its application.

If any thresholds are breached, indicative by a red flashing LED and "SENSOR FAIL" alert, maintenance might be required. Troubleshooting guidance is provided in the designated chapter for when the input conditions fall outside of operational ranges. The warranty, effective for years from the purchase date, covers necessary repairs. Contacting the manufacturer or authorized personnel expedites service and minimizes downtime.

**Terminology Clarification:**
- **Switch On**: Describes the conditions for activating the switch.
- **High**: Refers to the relay's state when a high condition is detected.
- **Non-Latching**: Indicates that the relay remains activated only while the condition persists.

Maintaining the physical integrity of the Detector in environments where electricity may pose hazards is paramount. Proper protective shipping and installation cautions are emphasized to prevent damage. Ensure to adhere to company guidelines and protective measures to maintain operational functionality.
