### Cooking to Minimize Soil Contamination 

For optimal cooking results, higher roasting temperatures can enhance flavor but also increase the risk of splattering. It is crucial not to brush or splash the meat while roasting. Proper coverage helps prevent splatter during cooking, allowing the dish to brown evenly without overcooking. 

### Replacing an Oven Light Bulb 

To replace the bulb, disconnect the power supply. For a bulb rated for 300°C with a screw fitting, remove the shelves and the cover. Use a screwdriver to detach the cover, then remove the old bulb. After inserting the new bulb, reattach the cover, replace the shelves, and restore power.
