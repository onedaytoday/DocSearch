### Paraphrased Instructions for Microwave Cooking 

**Blanching:** For AG-61+62D-UK English, blanching is recommended prior to cooking. This process, along with proper sealing and storage, can enhance preservation. Heat blanching prepares food for further cooking and ensures it is stored in airtight containers, which is essential for both preservation and ease of reheating via microwave. When microwaving, follow the specific instructions for thawing, heating, or cooking food quantities. A general guideline is: cook twice the amount for nearly double the time, and half the amount for half the time. 

Keep in mind that round food tends to cook more evenly than food with corners, as the corners may overcook in the microwave. Cover the food during cooking to reduce time, and ensure that portions, especially thicker ones, receive adequate microwave exposure to heat evenly. Rotating and turning food items, particularly larger portions, can promote even cooking. 

**Heating:** When reheating ready-made meals, ensure the food is covered with a microwave-safe plate or lid to retain moisture. Defrosting will typically take less time than conventional heating. Remember to use heat-resistant dishes when defrosting. Thin items require careful covering to avoid overcooking, while thicker items should be monitored for even heating. Adjust heating times to ensure the food is adequately warmed throughout.

**Fresh Food Cooking:** For fresh produce or meats, cook them directly without prior defrosting, seasoning them as usual. Following guidelines for cooking times will ensure thorough cooking, providing the best results.

**Microwave Operation:** Refer to the microwave's instructions, noting the specific functions for cooking soups, meats, and baked goods. To set the timer and cooking mode, align the TIMER/WEIGHT/POWER dial clockwise. Use the COOKING MODE button to select the desired action, and press START/QUICK to initiate.

**Microwave GRILL Function:** Utilize the grill function to brown or grill food directly. Begin with recommended times and adjust accordingly to avoid burning.

**Multiple Sequence Cooking:** Use this function to sequence cooking stages effectively, encompassing various modes. When required, adjust the TIMER/WEIGHT/POWER settings as necessary.

**Quick Start Function:** The START/QUICK button allows for immediate cooking with a preset time. Care should be taken to supervise children during operation, and the STOP button can be used to cancel.

**Safety Features:** To activate the safety lock, press and hold the STOP button for several seconds. 

**Automatic Cooking Functions:** The microwave features AUTOCOOK and AUTO DEFROST functions. Select by pressing the AUTOMATIC PROGRAMMES button and adjust parameters according to the weight of the food for optimal results. Follow the provided charts for guidance. Use the START/QUICK button for immediate action. 

These guidelines will ensure effective use of your microwave, enhancing both safety and cooking efficiency.

**Meat Preparation**  
Utilize a shallow dish suitable for microwave cooking. When preparing meat, ensure it is boneless and includes finely chopped onions and crushed garlic. If fresh beans are used, cook them finely and incorporate them with the seasoned meat. Secure the mixture with a toothpick, cover it, and heat until thoroughly cooked. To achieve a smooth consistency, whisk vigorously. Once thickened properly, grease the dish, layer in the meat, and cover it for cooking. 

**Additional Ingredients**
