### Instructions for Roasting Meat Using the Rotitherm Function

- **Roasting Meat**: When utilizing the Rotitherm function, it is important to focus exclusively on roasting meat, rather than cooking other food types simultaneously. If you wish to prepare other dishes, consider using a separate cooking function to avoid overcooking or burning the meat. 

- **Pre-heating and Selection**: Before starting, pre-heat the Rotitherm function as per the chart provided. Select the appropriate temperature according to the type and quantity of meat, ensuring adjustments for poultry, meats like Lancashire meatloaf, and game birds like pheasant or partridge.

- **Defrosting Guidelines**: For defrosting, set the function to 30°C. Cover food with a plate to expedite the process. Reference the defrosting chart for specific foods like meat and trout, ensuring all items are appropriately covered.

- **Preserving Heat**: The preserving feature is designed for items stored in screw-top jars. Ensure they are sealed securely. Turn off the function only when the items are ready for removal.

### Cleaning Instructions

- **General Cleaning**: Switch off the appliance before cleaning to avoid electrical shock. Use a damp cloth for routine cleaning, ensuring that high-pressure cleaners are avoided. 

- **Shelf Removal**: To clean the shelves, make sure to unscrew and carefully detach them from their mountings. Be cautious of sharp edges and ensure the appliance is completely cool before proceeding.
