**Sorting Instructions:**
Sort laundry into categories such as whites, coloreds, synthetics, and lightly colored items (including those that are cold-washable). It is advisable to wash new colored items separately to maintain their vibrancy. Treat pillowcases and textiles as indicated on care labels, ensuring they are not overloaded during washing.
