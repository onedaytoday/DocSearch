## Preface
The ESD-380 is engineered for heavy-duty applications, providing robust performance and secure installation. It features an advanced DSP with options for zooming—22X, 12X, and 23X (with additional items). The device captures at a resolution of 364X (or 276X for certain parameters), allowing for continuous operation with integrated backlight and infrared capabilities. These features make it suitable for various applications requiring high reliability. RS-485 connectivity enables the automation of monitored areas, while other advanced functions support a range of operational needs. Every unit is manufactured and rigorously tested under ISO conditions to ensure performance and durability.

## Key Features
- **Camera Performance**: Supports multiple zoom functionalities (DR 23X, 22X, 12X).
- **IR Backlight Functionality**: Enhances low-light imagery.
- **Continuous Operation**: The device is capable of lasting performance without interruption.

## Rotary Body Features
- **Preset Function**: Allows users to easily set and retrieve defined camera positions.
- **Auto-Turn Around**: Features tracking capabilities for automated monitoring.
- **Remote Access**: Supports remote functionality for operational convenience.

## Precautions
Ensure proper handling; avoid physical shocks or disassembly by unauthorized personnel. Operational temperature range is -30°C to 45°C (-22°F to 104°F). Use a soft cloth for cleaning and avoid harsh brightness which can cause glare.

## Quick Starting Guide
To begin using the ESD-380, access the ESD-CC1 keyboard:
