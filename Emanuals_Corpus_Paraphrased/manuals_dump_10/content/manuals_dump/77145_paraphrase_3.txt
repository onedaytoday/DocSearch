AS Introduction: Founded by JHD, we offer a range of IEC-tested and certified computers. The product functionality attracts clients, as the IEC 60945 tested interfaces are combined with advanced displays. Our IP-rated products cater to various applications, utilizing innovative technology that minimizes reflection and enhances performance. This enables effective heat management in state-of-the-art equipment like LCD-TFT and ETX-PC computers, ensuring long-term serviceability. These specifications facilitate new builds and installations, with options for front mounting that integrate seamlessly and provide IP66 protection.

Hatteland Computers’ MMC2 and MMD2 products, available from Q2, simplify the transition from LCDs to superior LCD technologies. The MMD series features products designed according to the highest industry standards and specifications. Our displays comply with IP66 IEC standards and are certified by organizations such as ABS, BV, ClassNK, DNV, GL, and LR, including specific models designed for ECDIS and ARPA.

AS Computers (MMC) utilize TFT-LCD technology in conjunction with advanced motherboards, offering functionality and design flexibility. Following rigorous IEC tests, these standalone and rack-mounted systems cater to diverse customer needs, including customizable RAM, graphics, storage cards, and factory-installed software. These systems meet IEC, IACS E10, and IEC regulations, being certified by enhances such as ABS, BV, ClassNK, DNV, GL, and LR, alongside JHD displays, allowing for versatility in power supply and mounting options.

Touchscreen Technology: Our touchscreen products come in resistive and capacitive variants, allowing for optimal customization. For capacitive screens, an electrically charged overlay detects touch interactions. ClearTek coatings enhance durability and accuracy, ensuring consistent performance—even in challenging environments.

Resistive touchscreens feature a hard-surface coating designed for reduced reflection, supporting high levels of touch pressure and durability. Both touchscreen types are rigorously tested for performance, compatibility with various cleaning agents, and resistance to wear and tear.

Mounting Guidelines: Information on the installation and positioning of products is crucial for optimal functionality. Care should be taken to select appropriate mounting options—be it wall or ceiling mounts—to ensure thermal management and operational efficiency. Proper air circulation is essential to prevent overheating, especially in enclosed spaces.

Installation Requirements: The installation setup should be free from excessive light reflections. Proper adjustment and spacing during installation are important for maintaining component integrity. Ensure grounding connections are secured and check the product condition upon receipt, as any damage should be reported immediately. Connectors, including RGB/DVI, RS232, parallel, LAN, and USB, must be handled with care to ensure appropriate operation.

This paraphrase retains the essence and technical details while presenting the information in a clearer format.

The RGB/DVI connection must be established at a high resolution, supporting UXGA for optimal performance. It’s essential to verify compatibility with the associated MMC products and utilize the appropriate mounting bracket; otherwise, it can void the warranty. Additional details can be found in the Technical section, which covers components like the MicroPlastic washers and their respective mounting instructions.

For the MMC ETX model, the LED brightness can be adjusted, and there's support for front USB I/O connections. The HDD LED indicates write activity, turning on during data transfer and requiring immediate release. The brightness settings can be adjusted when the unit is powered on. It's crucial that users manage the environment to prevent overheating, especially under sunlight conditions.

The PCI slot supports various COM ports and is compatible with specified network connections, such as Ethernet. The design protects warranty coverage if PC cards are mounted based on factory specifications. The system supports a range of input/output options, including USB and serial connections, ensuring versatile compatibility.

For CompactFlash cards, users must not remove them while the unit is operational to avoid data corruption. The specifications detail different operational models (AC and DC) and include power supply information.

The JH 10T08, JH 15T05, and JH 19T02 models feature TFT LCD displays with specified resolutions and brightness levels. Each model supports various memory configurations and communication protocols like USB and RS-232. Environmental specifications indicate humidity and temperature tolerances, alongside IP ratings for dust and water resistance.

Mechanical accessories and factory-mounted options are available, and careful consideration is required for installation and operation to maintain device integrity and performance.
