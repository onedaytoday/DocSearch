**Water Supply System Priming Instructions**

When initially connecting to the water supply, ensure the system is properly primed to avoid malfunctions. It's important to familiarize yourself with the system’s operations and perform necessary checks. The built-in safeguards are designed to stop water flow for safety, and if the machine is connected to a water source, it should only be operated with the water supply turned on to prevent issues.

**Ice Dispenser Operation Guidelines**

The ice dispenser is located on the top and functions properly when supplied with adequately cooled water. Make sure the supplying water is turned on before use. Activate the ice maker using the On/Off switch and operate as needed. Regularly check for any ice blockages and ensure the reservoir is not empty. In the event of unusual sounds during operation, switch off the appliance for maintenance. Always clean the system with approved products to prevent chemical interference.

**Replacing the Water Filter**

The water filter should be checked every few months for optimal performance. Replace it as needed, and keep track of its status via the indicator light. Use only NSF-certified filters to ensure safe and effective water filtration.

**Food Storage Suggestions**

To maximize storage efficiency, avoid overcrowding shelves which can hinder airflow and cooling. Use airtight containers for meat and other perishable items, ensuring they are sealed properly to prevent spoilage. Items that emit strong odors should be stored separately.

**Energy Conservation Tips**

Optimize energy use by keeping the refrigerator away from heat sources and ensuring it’s properly insulated. Regularly maintain and clean the appliance to avoid buildup that could hinder efficiency.

**Understanding Operational Sounds**

It’s normal to hear various sounds during operation, such as hissing during defrosting or clicking when cooling cycles initiate. These sounds indicate the system is functioning correctly.

**Cleaning and Maintenance Recommendations**

Maintain appliance cleanliness to preserve its appearance and efficiency. Use non-abrasive cleaners and avoid scratching sensitive surfaces. Ensure the unit is off and properly disconnected from power during maintenance.

**Replacing Light Bulbs**

Both the refrigerator and freezer sections have light bulbs that may require replacement. Use appropriate bulbs and exercise caution while handling light covers.
