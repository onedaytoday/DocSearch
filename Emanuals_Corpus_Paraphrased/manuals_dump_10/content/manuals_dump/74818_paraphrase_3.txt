## Appliance Overview

### Recommended Food Storage

Follow the guidelines for operating the thermostat, which manages freezing and cooling. The light indicators show temperature settings and operation modes. Adjust the thermostat (A) and the fast-freeze switch (B) as necessary to maintain food freshness. When food is fully frozen (approximately three hours), turn off the fast-freeze switch.

### Operational Tips

Normal sounds during operation, such as whirring or clicking, are typical and indicate normal performance. Ensure air circulation around stored food and avoid overloading to maintain optimal cooling. Use suitable containers to prevent moisture loss.

### Defrosting

The unit may build up frost over time. When frost thickness reaches 1/4 inch, begin defrosting. Turn the thermostat to the OFF position, and allow frost to melt, collecting excess water as needed. Use protective layers (like newspaper) to safeguard against spills.

## Maintenance and Cleaning

When performing maintenance, disconnect the unit from the power supply. Clean surfaces with a soft cloth; DO NOT use abrasive cleaners or strong deodorants, as they may damage the interior surface.

If the freezer exhibits any operational issues, refer to common symptoms such as temperature irregularities or excessive frost buildup. Contact Service Force for guidance and repairs if necessary.
