### General Cooking Tips

- For tougher cuts of meat, slow cooking is beneficial. Turn food as needed and utilize a meat thermometer to verify that the internal temperature reaches at least 75Â°C before serving.
- Proper food preparation is essential, especially for items that require longer cooking times. 

Follow these guidelines for optimal performance while cooking.

**Cooking Instructions and Maintenance**

**Cooking Soups and Meats:**
Begin by placing soups or meats on the hotplate. Cook until thoroughly heated, ensuring to cover the pot to retain moisture. For gradual cooking, reduce heat and allow food to simmer. If utilizing cornflour for thickening, do so carefully to avoid curdling. When reheating food, ensure it has cooled first, and only reheat once, either conventionally or in the microwave.

**Cleaning Procedures:**
Maintain a clean workspace to prevent fire hazards from splashes or residue. Use recommended cleaning products, avoiding abrasive materials. For hotplate maintenance, clean the surface regularly, ensuring the crowns are free from debris. If the cleaning light activates, verify that the crowns are correctly positioned. Clean the shelves regularly to maintain their finish.

**Installation Guidelines:**
Ensure proper ventilation and follow the British regulatory standards for installation. The appliance should be located away from flammable materials and follow specified height and safety instructions. 

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Dimensions**: Specific measurements for hotplate height and fitting clearance.
- **Connections**: Required details for installation, including ignition specifications and heat settings.
  
**Safety Requirements:**
Follow all safety guidelines and ensure appropriate ventilation. The appliance must connect to combustion products as mandated by BS regulations.

**Installation Parts and Stability:**

### Connecting to Gas

Ensure the gas connection is made correctly with the R/8 B.S.P. thread, which is located beneath the hotplate. **Note:** When attaching the inlet gas pipe to the reset valve, exclusively use liquid sealants; do not apply P.T.F.E. tape. Make sure the gas supply is adequately accounted for. The hose must comply with current BS standards. L.P.G. flexible connections should be of a type appropriate for L.P.G. applications and marked with a red stripe, band, or label.

### Fitting the Battery 

The battery is situated at the front of the appliance. To install the battery, securely connect it to the terminals.

### Pressure Testing 

Remove the front cover and ensure to check for pressure from each side. Turn off the supply while adjusting the F.S.D. phial and injector. Adjust the thermostat and hotplate to activate the system as necessary. Confirm that all components are correctly positioned before proceeding.

### Checking the Grill 

Light the grill and observe the attached components to ensure proper function. Verify operation by adjusting the settings accordingly.

### Checking the Hotplate 

Examine the burner crowns to confirm they are seated properly. Rotate each burner on the hotplate to ensure they ignite and function correctly.

### Checking the Lid Cut-Off Device 

Activate the hotplate to confirm gas supply. The hotplate should cease operation when the lid is closed. 

### Checking the Main Oven 

Set the thermostat and ignite the oven to verify proper functioning. The F.S.D. should activate during operation, allowing gas flow only when conditions are safe.

### Checking the Second Oven 

Rotate the thermostat anticlockwise to ignite the second oven. Ensure the indicator lights are functioning and that the F.S.D. operates as intended.
