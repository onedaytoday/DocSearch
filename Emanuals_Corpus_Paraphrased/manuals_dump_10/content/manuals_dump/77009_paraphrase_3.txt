**Document Camera Overview**

The document camera has transformed the conventional classroom experience, often rendering overhead projectors (OHP) less appealing. The ELMO document camera enhances classroom engagement by facilitating easy display and retention of research-based instructional materials, including math content. 

Lightweight and user-friendly, ELMO devices are designed for educational districts, offering seamless integration into teaching environments. The device features a zoom capability of 42.4X, along with dimensions of 5.3X and 8.0X, which provide flexibility in presenting material. Users can write directly on the display and switch effortlessly between PC and document camera functionality.

The system operates smoothly at a specified frames per second (fps), allowing for hands-on demonstrations with simplified controls. It includes a USB interface that connects easily to PCs. The new auto-brightness feature enhances visibility, whether using freehand or pre-defined shapes on the platform.
