To connect your device, select from the following input options: audio input (usually white) from the receiver, or the RF input to the ANT.IN connector. Ensure you connect it directly to a non-encrypted source for optimal quality. After purchasing, unpack the items, including the required software on the provided CD-ROM. Make sure to follow the on-screen instructions for software installation, which will automatically adapt to your region. Generally, connect to TV stations or other devices like VCRs and DVDs using the appropriate inputs. Note that both receivers may utilize the DC-12V power supply, and AAA batteries may be needed. Finally, switch to the correct input source on your TV or recording device, ensuring a seamless setup for high-quality recordings.
