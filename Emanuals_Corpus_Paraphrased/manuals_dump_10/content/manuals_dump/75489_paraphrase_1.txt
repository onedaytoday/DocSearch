### III. OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

#### GENERAL

This unit features either two or four hotplates, with each plate operating at KW or KW power. The hotplates function via the main control and can be cleaned using an additional scraper.

#### OPERATION

The yellow/green indicator lights indicate that the unit is operational. These lights activate when the unit is powered on, and deactivate when the cooking switch is turned off. 

The heating and thermostatic switch work together to manage cooking functions. The unit operates in a way that allows it to switch to standby mode automatically after cooking, and can be powered off at any moment. The cooking process can be interrupted, and it will self-regulate if left inactive for a set period.

#### STANDBY

The unit can be preheated without engaging the cooking function. Each heating element will automatically switch off if the designated cooking switch is turned off.

#### INFORMATION

During operation, the heating for each plate can be activated with its respective switch. Induction heating is designed to work with specific cooking pot bases, in accordance with model 62.9581.01_UL guidelines. 

**Warning:** Ensure appropriate pots are used; otherwise, the heating function may underperform or become too hot to touch. Properly cover hands to avoid burns when handling.

The cooking capacity can supply immediate heat to food, preventing overheating. 

When cooking, be cautious of maintaining the right conditions to avoid burning or overheating the plates. Ensure the plates do not operate empty to prevent damage.

#### CLEANING

For maintenance, clean the cooking surfaces promptly after use using suitable cleaning solutions. Avoid abrasive cleaners on plastic components. High-pressure cleaning methods may be applied carefully but should not be directed at electrical components. 

#### SHUTTING DOWN

To turn off the unit, wipe it down with a cloth that has a protective coating. Regular cleaning is essential for optimal function.

#### ERROR MANAGEMENT

In the event of operational anomalies, the control display will indicate issues, such as excessive current draw or overheating. Actions should be taken promptly to cool down the unit and mitigate further risks.

#### STORAGE SPACE

Designated areas for storage within the appliance should be maintained according to the supplied guidelines.

#### INSTALLATION AND OPERATING SAFETY

Follow the installation and operation instructions thoroughly. Always adhere to safety obligations to ensure correct usage and handle potential risks effectively. 

All electrical connections and protective measures must comply with standards to prevent hazards during operation and maintenance. 

**Technical Data:** Model numbers and certifications are provided for all components and setups as per UL197 guidelines. Proper installation distances and heights according to FDA and NSF standards must be observed to ensure safety and functionality.
