To activate the defrost feature, use the appropriate settings on the control panel, selecting the defrost option or adjusting the timer in seconds. The internal light indicates operation status. To stop the defrost cycle, press the appropriate button.

**Important Notes**
- The internal light will illuminate while defrosting, and food should be monitored throughout this process. 
- The defrosting duration is influenced by the type of food; with meat, for example, thicker cuts will take longer to thaw than minced or thinly sliced pieces.
- Ensure that all cuts of meat and poultry are fully defrosted before cooking. Do not leave defrosted food unrefrigerated or refreeze it after thawing.

### Helpful Tips for Buying and Preparing Food

When handling perishable foods, adhere to basic food safety guidelines to prevent bacterial growth during shopping, cooling, reheating, and defrosting. Always purchase foods that are 'fresh' and insulated, and refrigerate perishable items immediately upon returning home. 

Follow cooking instructions closely to ensure food is thoroughly cooked, particularly when reheating. A meat thermometer is recommended to confirm that meat has reached safe internal temperatures, specifically:
- 60°C for medium-rare  
- 70°C for medium  
- 80°C for well done

If not consumed right away, food should be cooled within one hour and stored appropriately. Use separate chopping boards for raw meat and other foods to avoid cross-contamination.

### Safety and Energy Saving Features

**Main Oven Light Activation**
The oven light turns on automatically during cooking. To deactivate the light while cooking, use the control panel. 

**Safety Cut-Off Feature**
If the oven temperature exceeds 250°C or operates for longer than specified times (e.g., 120°C for several hours), the system will shut down automatically.

**Child Safety Feature**
To activate the child safety feature, press and hold the relevant buttons for a few seconds until you hear a sound or see a safety indicator.

### Care and Cleaning Instructions

**Pre-Cleaning Procedures**  
Before cleaning the oven, allow the cooling fan to fully cool down the oven before disconnecting the power supply.

**Recommended Cleaning Materials**  
Avoid using bleach or cleaners that may damage the finish. For external cleaning, use a soft cloth to wipe down surfaces. Follow the provided cleaning instructions specifically for the model D8100-1M; use only recommended cleaners and avoid those that may dull brass finishes.

**Cleaning the Interior**  
The oven's interior can be cleaned with approved cleaners, ensuring to follow manufacturer’s guidelines. The Stayclean coating on the back and top should only be cleaned manually. Regular cleaning is suggested to prevent food splatters from hardening—set the oven to around 220°C for optimal performance. This process should be done periodically to maintain the Stayclean surface.

**Care Tips for Stayclean Surfaces**  
While Stayclean surfaces are designed to reduce cleaning needs, they still require maintenance. Avoid high roasting intervals to prevent increased splatter. It's essential to allow for adequate air circulation during cooking to prevent over-browning.

**Removing and Replacing Wirework**  
To detach shelves or side runners, carefully unhook them from the upper mounts and pull them out, ensuring proper alignment when reattaching.

**Grill and Oven Furniture Maintenance**  
Grill components can be washed in the dishwasher, or they can be hand-cleaned as needed. Always check and clean these parts before tackling the main cavity.
