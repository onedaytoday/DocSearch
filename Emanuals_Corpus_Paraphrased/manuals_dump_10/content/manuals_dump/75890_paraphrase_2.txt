### Refrigerator Storage Guidelines

When arranging bottles in the refrigerator, position them upright and avoid placing them sideways. For optimal storage, use the lowest shelf as it tends to be the coolest. The top shelf is generally warmer, so products sensitive to temperature should be kept lower. Ensure that food items are either packaged or covered, using airtight wraps or lids, to preserve their quality and prevent contamination.

It’s important to allow hot food to cool down to around 18°C before refrigerating, as this helps minimize condensation and bacterial growth. The FROSTMATIC function is recommended for quickly freezing items, and it can automatically switch off after a specified duration. Be mindful that the yellow light indicates the activation of this feature, and if manually switched off, it will resume its set parameters.

### Defrosting Instructions

For defrosting, it's helpful to cut food into smaller cubes, which aids in rapid thawing. When defrosting, ensure frost is removed regularly to maintain efficient operation. Avoid mechanical means such as heating to expedite the defrosting process, as this can be unsafe and potentially damage food products.

To clean, disconnect the power supply and allow the appliance to defrost completely. Use a soft cloth for cleaning the interior, avoiding abrasive materials that could cause damage. Consistency in cleaning is important to prevent build-up and maintain hygiene.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions

If the refrigerator is not cooling effectively, check if the appliance is unplugged or if a fuse has blown. Adjust settings as necessary; consult the user manual for guidance. In case of water accumulation, it could be due to improper function of the COOLMATIC or FROSTMATIC settings which need to be checked.

For electrical issues, ensure the device is unplugged before investigating, as live wires can pose shock risks. Follow the appropriate safety procedures outlined in the user manual.

### Compliance and Regulations

This appliance complies with relevant household safety regulations, specifically those outlined by GSG, VBG, and VDE. It adheres to EU directives concerning electrical and electromagnetic compatibility, ensuring safe operation in consumer environments.

The cooling mechanism works by transferring warmth away from food, creating a controlled internal environment that inhibits bacterial growth. The system is designed to dissipate heat effectively to maintain optimal performance.
