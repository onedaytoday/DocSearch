### Technical Rephrasing of the Text:

**Functionality Overview**

1. **Display Settings:**
   - The display mode switches between factory default settings and a user-defined color profile, enabling Black & White as an easy-to-read option. The resolution is optimized when graphics selections are made, enhancing overall clarity proportional to the chosen graphics.

2. **Input/Output Configuration:**
   - Use USB connectors to transfer data between SD cards and PCs. The presets can be accessed from the selected memory, and language settings for on-screen display (OSD) can be adjusted to display either English or default settings.
   - The system will retain user settings even when powered down.

3. **RGB Connections:**
   - Ensure the correct connection of RGB and DC power inputs. Engage the power switch to turn the system on.
   - Connect to the PC via RGB inputs and ensure the appropriate settings are configured to facilitate signal transmission.

4. **Peripheral Specifications:**
   - Maintain compatibility with peripherals; the system supports USB2.0 for optimal performance. For power connection, use AC or DC IN 12V. Ensure all inputs and outputs maintain the correct polarity.

5. **Operational Procedures:**
   - To store and operate, ensure the switch is turned off during configuration. When ready for use, turn the switch on and adjust settings for brightness as necessary using the designated buttons.
   - If utilizing an optional SD, follow the prompts to avoid malfunctions. In case of issues, connectivity to the front operations should be double-checked.

6. **Data Management:**
   - When managing SD data, ensure to format the card correctly, as instructed in the OSD prompts. Be cautious of write-protection settings on the SD card.
   - For troubleshooting, ensure that the connected PC meets the necessary operating system requirements.

In summary, the required procedures and settings for optimal functionality must be followed closely to ensure smooth operation and effective management of inputs, outputs, and power sources.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE**

To start the device, ensure it is connected to a PC or power source. Turn on the switch. Access the On-Screen Display (OSD) and navigate to the [Graphics] section. Adjust the brightness settings as needed by selecting [BRIGHTNESS] and using the associated controls detailed on page 39 of the OSD guide. 

For 3D shooting, switch the device on and position the head accordingly as indicated. Activate the autofocus by pressing the [AF] button, while following the selection prompts on the OSD (refer to page 36). Adjust brightness again using the [BRIGHTNESS] controls, as explained on page 39, and toggle the power switch to ON/OFF as necessary.

**VARIOUS FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS**

The system allows for rotation adjustments for various formats, maintaining a specified ratio for both standard and enhanced SD outputs. The autofocus function can be engaged by pressing [AF]. Once an object is in focus, the shutter can be released. This procedure applies to tasks like capturing reflective subjects against bright backgrounds.

Brightness adjustments can be made through the OSD, utilizing the [BRIGHTNESS] and [MENU OK] selections.

**FUNCTIONS AND SETTINGS**

To switch between inputs, the OSD displays options for [CAMERA] and [RGB IN] inputs seamlessly. When switching input types, the corresponding OSD should update accordingly. 

For white balance settings, initiate the [One-Push] function when a white subject appears in the frame to establish a fixed white reference. This adjustment is versatile across color temperatures from 3000K to 8000K.

**MEMORY AND SETTINGS**

Stored configurations can be recalled by navigating through the OSD. The state of saved settings will persist, even when the device is powered off. If the device is shut down, previously configured settings can be accessed upon reboot. 

**TROUBLESHOOTING**

In case of operational anomalies, check the connections and ensure power supply integrity. Verify the AC input is stable and transitions between RGB and Video modes function as expected. If issues arise with lighting or focusing, manual adjustments may be necessary. 

**SPECIFICATIONS**

- Power supply: 12VDC (with AC option: 100-240V)
- Consumption: 9W (AC only)
- Input Types: Main/External RGB, USB Memory, RCA
- CCD: Supports both NTSC and PAL formats
