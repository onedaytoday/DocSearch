The appliance must be grounded. Ensure that it is connected to an AC power supply as indicated on the rating plate, which is located on the back cover. The electrical connections have been designed to comply with ASTA (BS) standards. If the wiring is altered for any reason, ensure that the wires are correctly color-coded: the yellow wire must be connected to Earth, indicated as 'E' or colored yellow; the blue wire should go to Neutral, marked as 'N' or colored blue; and the brown wire must connect to Live, referred to as 'L' or colored red. Any improper connections can cause severe electrical shocks due to exposure from the outer sheath.

To ensure electrical safety, it is important to verify the earth continuity and insulation of the appliance. Perform an Earth Continuity Check to confirm that the earth leads are clean and securely connected. Then, conduct an Insulation Check with the appliance disconnected, ensuring that all switches are turned on. If any readings are below acceptable thresholds or show signs of burning or arcing, corrective action must be taken.

For commissioning, follow these steps: set the knob to MAX, then to MIN, and transition from MIN to MAX. If the appliance does not ignite or extinguishes during testing, troubleshoot as needed.
