To properly use racks and cookware, ensure an offset position is maintained to avoid burns from hot surfaces. Use potholders when handling hot items. Keep food properly spaced between racks to ensure even heat distribution. This distance prevents direct contact with the cavity walls, allowing warm air to circulate the cookware efficiently.

When removing hot items, grasp both sides and gently pull forward to clear the back panel. Avoid forcing racks into the cavity as this can cause burns or damage. The type of cookware influences cooking efficiency; select materials that conduct heat well and are easy to clean. Ensure tight fitting to maintain balanced cooking.

To activate specific settings, such as defrost or cook time, adjust the knobs clockwise or counterclockwise as required. A guide for appropriate cooking settings is available for reference.

For preheating, select the appropriate temperature based on the cooking mode. Begin by pressing the UPPER OVEN, followed by BAKE and then START. During preheating, the convection feature may produce sounds, indicating the oven is ready. Cancelation of preheating is possible, but it is crucial to select the correct cooking method for optimal results.

When broiling, avoid exposing grease. If a fire emerges, use a fire extinguisher or cover the flames without using water.

Convection cooking options promote even heating and consistent results. Follow cooking instructions closely to maximize performance, especially with the Convection Convert setting. Always monitor food closely and cancel the cooking process if necessary for safety and efficiency.

### About Convection Cooking

Convection cooking is ideal for preparing meats and poultry. The method involves circulating heated air around the food, ensuring even cooking and reducing cooking time. Preheat the oven to specific temperatures based on the type of food, typically around 350°F (176°C) for optimal results. Follow the preheating guidelines and cooking charts provided, ensuring that food reaches appropriate internal temperatures, such as 170°F (76°C) for poultry.

When using the convection roast feature, ensure that the roasting pan is positioned correctly to capture grease, which contributes to enhanced flavor. For best results, avoid covering the food, allowing it to roast evenly.

### Internal Temperature Checks

To guarantee food safety, check the internal temperature of meats and poultry using the provided guidelines. Insert the thermometer in the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bones. Common target temperatures are 170°F (76°C) for poultry and specific temperatures for various meats, as indicated in the cooking instructions. 

### Food Safety Precautions

It is crucial to avoid food poisoning risks by ensuring that meats are not left at room temperature for prolonged periods. If you need to cancel the cooking process, you can do so at any time. 

### Slow Cooking Settings

For slow cooking, you may use settings typically ranging from 225°F (108°C) to 275°F (134°C). Make sure to fully thaw foods before cooking, and monitor the cooking time closely to prevent overcooking.

### Perfect Cooking Tips

Utilize the convection setting to achieve perfectly cooked meats, monitoring internal temperatures to prevent overbrowning. Ensure that your meat is cooked to the recommended temperatures, such as 325°F (163°C) for roasting, and follow the cooking charts for guidance.

### Defrosting Guidance

When defrosting, utilize the specific setting designed for this purpose, ensuring that food stays at safe interior temperatures. Input the correct settings for efficient and safe thawing. 

### Bread Proofing

When proofing bread, maintain a warm environment by lightly covering the dough. Follow specific temperature guidelines to expedite the rising process effectively.

### Cooking Preferences

Utilize the "My Favorites" feature to easily access your preferred cooking settings. You can save, overwrite, or delete old settings as needed.

### Multi-Stage Cooking

The multi-stage cooking option allows you to automate several cooking functions. Input the desired settings for sequential cooking tasks, ensuring that each stage is set correctly before starting.

### Sabbath Mode

The oven can be configured for use during Sabbath or holidays, disabling certain features to comply with traditional practices. Follow the specific instructions provided for setting this mode.

For precise operation and to avoid any safety issues, always refer to the cooking charts and guidelines included in the manual.
