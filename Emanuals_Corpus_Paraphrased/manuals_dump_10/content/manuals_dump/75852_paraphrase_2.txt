**OPERATION**
Ensure the thermostat is set correctly. Adjust it based on food types and ambient conditions; temperatures excessively above 16°C may prevent proper cooling. When defrosting, responsibly manage food items to minimize safety risks. 

Thawed food should not be refrozen without cooking first. It is advised to place fresh food in specific sections to optimize cooling. 

**HINTS AND TIPS**
To maintain food freshness, store different food types separately to avoid cross-contamination. Keep food covered and adhere to any storage guidelines to prevent spoilage.

Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning. Use non-abrasive cleaning products, avoiding strong detergents or waxes that may damage surfaces. For light replacement, first disconnect the power, then follow proper procedures to access and replace the light fixture.

**DEFROSTING**
Regularly check and defrost when frost thickness reaches a specified level to maintain optimal performance and prevent overflow.

**TROUBLESHOOTING**
