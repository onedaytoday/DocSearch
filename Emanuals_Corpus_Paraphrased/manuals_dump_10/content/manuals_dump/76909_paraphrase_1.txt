To ensure a smooth and accurate installation process, please review the following straightforward guidelines prior to beginning. Confirm that your installation adheres to all relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes. The provided instructions serve as a reference for the fountain. Grounding electrical devices—such as telephones and computers—via water lines is a common practice. This grounding may occur either within the building or externally. However, it can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, causing electrolysis, which can result in a metallic taste and increase metal content in the water. This issue can be prevented by using the specified materials. All drain fittings installed should be made of plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the plumbing system of the building. 

As for the installation, ensure the wall is prepared as indicated, with necessary supply lines routed through the back and thoroughly flushed to clear any debris. Connect the water supply securely and carefully. If the water pressure exceeds 80 PSIG, it may void the warranty. Adjust the height of the fountain within recommended limits by turning the adjustment screws accordingly—clockwise to raise and counter-clockwise to lower.

**Troubleshooting and Maintenance**: For any service needs, it is critical that an authorized service technician performs the work.
