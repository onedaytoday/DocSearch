**INSTALLING THE COOKER HOOD**

Begin by attaching the Ceiling/Support Shelf securely to the designated area. Use the template provided to ensure proper alignment with the shelf. The template should correspond with the dimensions of your ceiling. Be sure to use the appropriate screws for mounting, selecting those that are hollow and compatible with the ceiling's thickness. 

When installing the shelf, position the outlet (Ducted) correctly, and cross-reference the screw types to ensure they fit adequately. Make sure to apply screws with washers when securing the shelf. If adjustments are needed for the height of the installation, position the screws accordingly, ensuring they are at the desired elevation, before tightening them firmly.

Ensure that all screws are tightened completely to maintain stability and prevent any structural failures. It is vital that the mountings are robust enough to withstand the thrust produced by the cooker hood during operation. 

For ducted installations, consider using the most direct route for effective performance, ideally minimizing sharp bends. This will optimize airflow and prevent impairment. Compliance with fire safety regulations, such as British standards or DIN 4102-B1 for flammable materials, is critical.

For ducting options, choose either top mounting within the housing or an alternate style based on the installation specifics. If your setup involves gas-burning appliances, ensure proper sealing and ventilation. If using charcoal filters, confirm they are appropriately fitted to manage odors and grease.

The Chimney assembly includes sections that must be connected using the screws provided. Ensure that grease is filtered effectively through the activated charcoal and that the entirety of the unit is installed with the screws supplied. Additionally, check that the lighting is functioning correctly as part of your installation.
