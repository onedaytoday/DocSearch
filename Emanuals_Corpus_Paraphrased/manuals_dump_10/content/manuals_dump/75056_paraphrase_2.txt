**AG-21+22D-UK ENGLISH Microwave Instructions for Cooking and Defrosting**

When browning food, it's essential to achieve a desirable color, akin to the browning achieved with seasonings like Worcestershire sauce or onions. Ready-to-eat meals should be heated on a covered plate. Avoid exposing the food directly, as this may lead to uneven heating. For optimal results, ensure the heating temperature is slightly elevated, allowing for even distribution of heat.

**Defrosting Guidelines:**
Use a microwave for defrosting, which can be more effective than traditional methods. Always cover the food while defrosting to prevent it from becoming too dry. It's crucial to ensure that the items are defrosted sufficiently without overcooking. The microwave should be set to appropriate heat-resistant levels as per guidelines. If food is too thick, it may not defrost properly.

**Cooking Fresh Vegetables:**
Cook vegetables in their entirety, seasoning them as necessary. Refer to specific guidelines for cooking methods and times, particularly when using high-powered microwaves. Nutritional quality tends to be better maintained when food is fresher.

**Cooking Meat, Fish, and Poultry:**
Ensure that these items are cooked thoroughly for safety. As with other foods, follow specific cooking times and indications to achieve the desired browning effect.

**Microwave Functionality:**
When using the microwave, parameters like cooking time and power level are crucial. Adjust these according to the food type being prepared. Cooking time can be modified in seconds as needed.

Reduce cooking times by one-third to one-half when using a microwave oven. Follow cooking instructions tailored for microwave use, ensuring that food is suitable for microwave preparation. Adjust ingredient quantities accordingly to prevent overcooking.
