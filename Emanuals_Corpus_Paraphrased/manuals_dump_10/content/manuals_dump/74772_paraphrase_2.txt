### Ice Cube Preparation and Cleaning Instructions

To prepare ice cubes, ensure the appliance is properly set to the desired mode for the required duration. Verify that the necessary components are included. For optimal performance, particularly over months of usage, it's essential to pre-treat foods known for high moisture content to prevent frost build-up. This process typically requires defrosting to ensure efficient operation.

Regular cleaning of the interior is crucial for maintaining cleanliness and preventing frost accumulation. **Warning:** Before cleaning, disconnect the power to avoid electric shock. Always switch off the appliance and unplug it before initiating any cleaning procedure.

Use a damp cloth with a suitable cleaner to clean surfaces, avoiding harsh chemicals that may leave residue on food items. Ensure all food is covered before cleaning and allow it to cool to prevent heat transfer.
