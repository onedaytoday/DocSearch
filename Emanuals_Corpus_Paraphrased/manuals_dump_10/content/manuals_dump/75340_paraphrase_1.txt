## Cooking Operation Guide

### Cooking Overview
Cooking refers to the process of preparing food. Preheating the oven is essential; it should reach the specified temperature before placing food inside for optimal cooking. Without preheating, achieving the recommended cooking temperature may be challenging.

### Preheating and Cooking Functions
Ensure you preheat the oven before cooking. Always refer to the cooking chart for guidance on temperatures and times. For batch cooking, you may need to adjust temperatures downward by about 20-25°C to ensure even cooking.

### Indicator Lights and Functions
The indicator light signifies when the oven is heating or cooling. This temperature management is crucial while selecting the cooking function. Some foods may not require preheating, but follow guidelines for optimal results.

### Cooking Charts
Different foods require specific temperatures and cooking times. For example, the grill chart outlines times for various meats and fish. Always consider the thickness and type of food when determining shelf positioning and cooking duration. 

### Roasting Guidelines
The roasting chart provides internal temperature ranges for meats to ensure proper doneness. When using the oven, allow adequate space and aim for even heat distribution around the food, especially when roasting items like Yorkshire puddings or cakes.

### Cleaning and Maintenance
After cooking, allow the oven to cool before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning agents that won’t damage surfaces or finishes. Manual cleaning is often required for shelves, especially if they have non-stick coatings.

### Troubleshooting
If cooking is uneven or the appliance malfunctions, inspect the oven's function settings and ensure the electrical connections are secure. For persistent issues, consult the service center for professional assistance. 

Always adhere to the recommended procedures for optimal cooking performance and maintenance.
