The engineering of these systems takes into account various factors like dimensions and installation requirements, allowing for flexibility in construction. The front-mounted design of the HATTELAND Computers MMC2 and MMD2 facilitates ease of integration, while multiple options are available based on your specifications.

**Computer Specifications and Testing**

The MMC computers are constructed with TFT-LCD technology, allowing for a variety of applications and configurations. These systems are rigorously tested to IEC standards and are available in different configurations such as stand-alone or rack-mounted setups. Various performance features include operating RAM, graphics capabilities, and factory-installed software.

The products adhere to international standards from organizations like ABS, BV, ClassNK, DNV, GL, and LR. They are built to operate under AC or DC power conditions and are designed to accommodate mechanical requirements.

**Touchscreen Information**

The touchscreen options include both resistive and capacitive technologies, each tailored for specific applications. Capacitive touchscreens utilize an electrically charged overlay, while resistive screens are designed for durability and environmental resistance.

Touchscreen performance is defined by various factors, including the number of touch locations and resistance to cleaners. These displays have a clear protective overcoat that increases durability while maintaining functionality and user experience.

**Installation Guidelines**

Proper installation is crucial for achieving optimal performance. Ensure that all hardware components are securely fastened and that grounding connections are made to minimize electrical interference. The workspace must be clear of obstructions to maintain visibility and operation.

For further details and specifications, please visit the company website or refer to the included documentation.

The RGB/DVI configuration should be optimized to achieve high performance, specifically catering to the UXGA display resolution. It’s important to conduct thorough testing with the specific Bracket mounting for MMC products. For any critical or serious applications, adhere to the warranty guidelines outlined in the Technical section. 

The system includes RenCol MicroPlastic washers for mounting. Ensure to utilize shoulder washers appropriately; each mounting point should be equipped with the relevant washers alongside MMC products, specifically models IND100078-10 and INB100014-1.

**Physical Specifications: MMC ETX**
- **LED Brightness and USB Connectivity**: The front USB input/output supports USB connections, typically including the necessary operating system or CDs. The HDD LED indicates write activity, turning on during operations and turning off shortly thereafter. Note that the LED might appear red during operation. 

- **Brightness Adjustments**: The unit features a transreflective display allowing operation under varying light conditions, including direct sunlight. Be cautious not to remove the mounted software or interfere during operation. 

**Additional Connectivity**: 
The PCI slots (COM1 to COM4, PS/2) include isolated support for Ethernet (LAN & GBLAN) with standard CAT.5E connections. RGB output utilizes the D-SUB 15P connector, while LPT1 employs a D-SUB 25P connector, with all screws affixed to the housing.

**Inputs and Outputs**: 
The system accommodates USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 connections and supports CompactFlash II cards mounted appropriately. Do not attempt to remove the flash card while the system is powered on, as this may corrupt the data.

The specifications also outline compatibility and support for various AC and DC inputs, along with operational characteristics under specific environmental conditions (temperature and humidity).

**Hardware Specifications**: 
The system components like the TFT display, monitor characteristics (pitch, color ratio), and memory support (via SODIMM with ECC from 256MB up to 1GB) are standardized across models JH 10T08, JH 15T05, and JH 19T02, ensuring proper integration and functionality.

**Safety and Compliance**: 
All components comply with international safety standards (EN60945, IEC945, etc.) and have passed operational testing per specified conditions to ensure durability in various environments.

This information serves as a foundational guideline for installation, operation, and maintenance of the respective MMC models, focusing on optimal configuration and compliance with warranty stipulations.
