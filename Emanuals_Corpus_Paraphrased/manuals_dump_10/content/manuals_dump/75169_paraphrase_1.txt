The LW GN tradition integrates research in creativity with professional operational choices, featuring high standards in cooking, including the cook & chill method tailored to specific requirements. The air-o-steam B offers various operating modes, such as convection, allowing meat to be cooked without the use of gratin techniques and employing a half-power function for steam cooking. This approach enhances the quality of food, minimizes cooking times, and preserves flavor and texture. The product also provides options for holding food (like cakes) while managing cooking temperatures and cleaning protocols.

Equipped with HACCP compliance, the system records cooking parameters to ensure food safety. The technical specifications include dual-speed convection and steaming capabilities, alongside a structured cooking chamber suitable for various operations. The construction features thermo-glazed surfaces, efficient lighting, and IPX5 protection against water ingress.
