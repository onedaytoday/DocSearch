The cooling system comprises coolers operating at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C, designed with varying thicknesses and either built-in or external units. These four coolers feature pre-charged cooling systems, constructed with new assembly techniques, ensuring optimal performance and high efficiency. They are insulated with pre-painted polyurethane and are free from CFC and HCFC substances. The rounded corners enhance safety and aesthetics. 

The fast-fit design enables easy installation and features airtight PVC components. The system is capable of handling high ambient temperatures (+43°C) and uses refrigerant R404A, with specifications for both high and low applications. Defrosting is facilitated by heated elements to minimize frost accumulation, and the interior is equipped with IP54-rated lighting.

Key components include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat. The doors are right-hinged and utilize smooth cam-lift action hinges to maintain airtightness and high insulation efficiency. This design aids in reducing energy consumption and ensures compliance with HACCP standards.
