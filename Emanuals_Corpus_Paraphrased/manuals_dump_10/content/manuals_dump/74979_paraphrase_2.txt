### Operating Instructions

**Switches and Functions:**  
The switches on the right indicate their respective functions. When either cooking mode is active, the corresponding switch will turn off and emit a warning sound when the desired temperature is reached. The indicator lights will flash to signal the readiness of the function.

**Ventitherm and Operating Instructions:**  
The shelves are numbered from top to bottom. Ensure that heat-resistant sheets are placed correctly, focusing on the front to optimize cooking. For cakes and other dishes, the placement and use of each shelf should be considered carefully, especially when a higher temperature is needed to achieve thorough cooking. Always preheat using the Ventitherm function before loading food onto the shelves.

**Dough Preparation:**  
For yeast dough, allow it to rise as needed, either covered or uncovered, depending on the process. Preheat the oven with the designated function to activate the yeast properly, ensuring that the dough is managed on a flour-dusted surface.

**Baking Instructions:**  
Different types of baked goods (e.g., shortcrust or ring-shaped pastries) require individual preheating. Follow the specified temperatures for each type, ensuring a consistent outcome. Be attentive to signs that indicate cooking completion.

**Roasting Guidelines:**  
When roasting, use the Ventitherm or Rotitherm functions based on the type of meat. Consider heat resistance and factor in direct cooking methods for larger cuts. Monitoring the meat's temperature with a thermometer is recommended for optimal results.

**Defrosting Protocols:**  
Utilize the Ventitherm function at the recommended temperature when defrosting. Exposing food to air during defrosting may enhance efficiency. Maintain attention during the process and cover items as necessary.

**Preservation Instructions:**  
Use the appropriate function for preserving food, ensuring jars are properly sealed and placed correctly on the shelf. Maintain attention to food quantities to prevent overloading.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**  
Regularly clean the appliance with a soft cloth and suitable cleaners to avoid damaging protective surfaces. Follow safety instructions during maintenance tasks, especially when handling lighting elements.
