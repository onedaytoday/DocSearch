### Ice Water Usage and Maintenance Instructions

**Caution**: Always ensure the water filter is correctly installed. Avoid rotating or turning parts unless specified, as this may lead to improper function. The crushed ice option should not be misused to prevent malfunctions.

**Ice and Water Dispenser Location**: The ice and water dispenser is situated in the top right section of the fresh food compartment. It is recommended to replace the water filter every six months by pressing the touch light for activation. Refer to the manual or the website for further instructions on maintenance.

**Water Filtration**: The PureAdvantage™ filtration system has been certified by NSF International for its effectiveness in reducing specific contaminants. For optimal performance, replace the filter every six months.

**Proper Food Storage**: To maximize cooling efficiency, avoid overcrowding the shelves to facilitate air circulation. Keep raw meat separate from other food items and store them at lower temperatures to maintain freshness. Seal foods in airtight containers to prevent freezer burn and preserve quality.

### Understanding Normal Operating Sounds

Expect some operational sounds, such as hissing or clicking, which indicate normal functioning of the high-efficiency system. These may occur when the defrost heater operates or during cooling cycles.

### Cleaning Guidelines

To maintain the unit's appearance and prevent build-up, clean surfaces immediately using non-abrasive cleaners. Avoid using scouring pads or bleach-based products, as these may damage finishes. Always disconnect from power source before cleaning.

### Warranty Information

### Common Issues and Corrections

**Cooling Issues:**
- If the food section feels too cold or displays "Too Cold," check the cooling settings. Ensure the cooling mechanism is operational and that the outlet is connected.
- Verify that the interior is clean, without any dirt or wear, and that items are stored properly. 
- Observe the cooling On/Off button's location and ensure it’s functioning correctly.

**Moisture and Frost Accumulation:**
- If moisture, frost, or ice is collecting on the walls, inspect the covers for tight seals. Excess moisture can lead to frost and internal sweating; adjust accordingly.
- Regularly clean and ensure items are not overcrowded, as this can contribute to improper cooling.

**Ice Production Issues:**
- If the ice maker is not producing sufficient ice, check the household water supply. Make sure it’s fully connected and not restricted.
- Inspect the ice maker’s switch and ensure it is functioning. If the ice is hollow or insufficiently formed, clean the supply line and check for clogs.

**Water Supply Problems:**
- For slow water flow or supply issues, verify that the household water connection is secure and not blocked.
- Clean the unit thoroughly, as dirt buildup can impede performance.

**Lighting Issues:**
- If lights are not functioning, check the light switch and ensure it is engaged properly. Verify that both lights are operational and clean as necessary.

By addressing these common issues systematically, you can ensure proper operation and maintenance of your equipment.
