- **Types of Stains:** For chewing gum, grease, mustard, coffee, and candle wax, use the following methods:
  - **Pre-treatment:** Apply a stain remover or prewash treatment and let it sit.
  - **Scraping:** Gently scrape excess residue off the fabric before washing.
  - **Cleaning Agents:** Use specific cleaning products that contain bleach as necessary, always following safety precautions.

**Preventive Measures:**

- Maintain awareness of potential causes for common washing issues such as stains, odors, or noise. Overloading, incorrect settings, and undissolved detergent can contribute to these problems.
  
- **Noise Issues:** Common noises may stem from imbalance, overloading, or transportation damage. If unusual sounds occur, discontinue use immediately and redistribute the load.

**Water Supply Concerns:**

- Inspect water supply connections and hoses for blockages or kinks if water is slow to fill or unsuitable temperatures are experienced. Ensure water supply is sufficient and heater settings are correct (ideally above 130°F/70°C).

**Maintenance and Cleaning:**

- Clean the washer regularly with appropriate household cleansers to prevent residue build-up, and occasionally examine hoses for kinks or blockages.
