### Fan Oven Usage Guide

The fan oven is designed for efficient cooking or baking. 

**Preheating**  
The oven should reach its desired temperature for optimal cooking performance. It’s essential to preheat before starting to cook; this helps in achieving the recommended high cooking temperature.

**Cooking Temperatures**  
Follow the provided cooking chart closely. For batch baking, adjust the temperature down by 20°C to 25°C as necessary.

**Using the Fan Oven**  
1. Turn the oven on to the desired setting.  
2. Note that the cooling fan operates independently and will continue to run after turning off the oven to ensure it cools efficiently.

### Oven Shelving  
Proper shelf placement is crucial for even cooking. Ensure the shelves are positioned straight and fully inserted at the back of the oven. 

**Tips for Effective Cooking**  
Switch shelves during cooking for uniform heat distribution. Use the center shelf for optimal airflow. Heavy or non-stick bakeware may enhance browning. Avoid excessively high temperatures, as this can lead to over-browning of food.
