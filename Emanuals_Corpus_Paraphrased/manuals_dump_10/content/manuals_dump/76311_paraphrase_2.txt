**Maintenance and Service Instructions**

To clean, first ensure the ECO VALVE for emergency emptying is accessed by following the proper procedure for emptying the hose. If necessary, the cooled area should be addressed as outlined previously—remove the cover using a screwdriver.

For troubleshooting, if the operation light starts flashing, this indicates a malfunction. Please refrain from contacting service personnel immediately. If the light signals an issue, check if the components, including the hose, are properly closed and functioning as intended. 

Common issues can arise from:

- Clogged hoses or improper selections leading to undesirable operation.
- The use of unsuitable options resulting in inefficiency.
- The need for redistributing product flows, which can be manually adjusted if necessary.

For any technical service inquiries, please reach out via phone for assistance with service arrangements or purchases. Ensure you maintain a suitable water supply, ideally between 40-30°C, and refer to the EEC standards provided for compliance.

**Safety Precautions**

When ensuring security, unscrew the three screws on the porthole. Confirm that the cold water supply is properly connected and that maintenance was performed by qualified personnel. Should there be any drainage issues, consult a plumber for efficient resolution.

**Hose Guidelines**

The hose must be positioned to facilitate optimal performance; it should be of adequate length and quality to prevent operational issues. In case of supply replacement or any service requirement, consult authorized personnel.

**Recycling Information**

This appliance should be responsibly discarded or recycled based on local regulations. Keep informed about how to properly recycle old appliances, typically through local municipal services.
