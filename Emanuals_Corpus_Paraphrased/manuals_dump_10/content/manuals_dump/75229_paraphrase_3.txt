### Oven Functions and Maintenance Guidelines

**Roasting and Cooking Functions**  
The oven features the Rotitherm function suitable for various meat thicknesses, specifically designed for roasting. Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature and position the meat on the specified shelf. It’s essential to ensure the oven is preheated adequately to achieve optimal cooking results for meat and poultry.

**Defrosting Function**  
To defrost food, unwrap it and place it on the designated shelf. Cover it appropriately, and avoid wrapping materials that could extend the defrosting process. Rotate items like meat and poultry to facilitate even thawing. Food items such as cream and trout should be defrosted with care, ensuring they remain upright during the process.

**Drying Function**  
The oven can be utilized for drying using convection heat. Arrange items like beans, mushrooms, and fruits on greaseproof-covered shelves. Ensure to leave the door slightly ajar for airflow, allowing items to cool overnight after drying is complete.

**Preservation Function**  
When using the heat-only preservation option, ensure jars are suitable for canning and affix the lids securely. Fill jars without allowing contents to touch each other, reducing the temperature to 100°C. Soft fruits and vegetables like pears, mushrooms, and beans can be preserved effectively this way.

Before replacing or cleaning the light cover, disconnect the oven from the electrical supply. Carefully remove and clean the light cover, ensuring it is securely reattached. Use heat-resistant units when necessary.
