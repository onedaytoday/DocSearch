### USING THE TELESCOPIC RUNNERS (where applicable)

Follow the proper guidelines for positioning shelves securely.

For any additional components or replacements, please purchase them through authorized service providers.

### Grill Pan and Handle
Position the grill pan and handle correctly, ensuring that the food is centered directly above the heat source. The food should be situated properly on the included shelf. For optimal cooking, ensure that foods like meats are placed with sufficient distance to prevent splattering. Adjusting for food thickness can affect cooking time. When toasting, preheat the grill to a high setting. Monitor and turn the food as necessary for even cooking.

### Second Oven
The second oven is designed for baking cakes and similar dishes, operating at a cooking temperature of 100°C. To use, turn the oven off ('O') and monitor the internal light to determine when it is ready. Position the oven shelves straight to the back for optimal heat distribution. Note that the cooking performance may vary depending on the shelf positioning.

### Main Fan Oven
This oven utilizes a fan for efficient cooking. Preheat the oven until it reaches the recommended temperature. Cooking temperatures can typically be adjusted down by 20°C to 25° C depending on specific recipes. Use the fan function for batch baking, ensuring that the shelves allow sufficient airflow. Be cautious of using rough cookware, as it can lead to excessive browning.

### Conventional Oven
This oven type allows for traditional cooking methods without the added operation of a fan. It's particularly effective for gratins and similar dishes. The operation of the oven can be monitored via the internal light. Placement of dishes can significantly influence cooking results, so maintain good spacing.

### Oven Cooking Chart
Follow the provided shelf placements and temperature guidelines, especially for specific foods like meringues and pastries. Adjust temperatures based on the function in use.

### Roasting Chart
Utilize this chart for recommended cooking times and temperatures for various meats. This will assist in achieving the desired internal temperature for safety and quality.

### Pizza Function
Ideal for foods requiring top browning, ensure food is placed centrally on the shelf. Avoid using rough cookware to prevent damages.

### SpeedCook
This function allows for rapid cooking without preheating, but you may need to adjust cooking times for optimal results. Ensure you monitor the light indicators to check that the function is operating properly.

### Thermal Grilling
This method combines grilling with heat circulation for even cooking. It’s effective for preparing dishes like shepherd's pie, ensuring even heating throughout. Always monitor the internal light for readiness.

### Cooking Guidelines

**General Cooking Tips**
- Position food evenly around the cooking area, avoiding overcrowding. Foods like fish can be placed directly on the shelf or on a lower level.
- Cook food at recommended settings, usually between 140-220°C (284-428°F). Adjust cooking times based on the thickness of the food.
  
**Thermal Grilling Chart**
- For optimal results, reference the thermal grilling chart based on food type, temperature, and cooking duration (e.g., rashers, chops, whole fish).
  
**Defrosting Foods**
- Utilize the defrost function to thaw food without applying heat. It is effective for food items like cakes with icing. 
- Always monitor the internal temperature during defrosting, ensuring it remains within safe limits. Avoid leaving defrosted food at room temperature for too long to prevent bacterial growth.

**Food Buying and Preparation Tips**
- When shopping, select the freshest products and ensure perishable items are insulated to maintain freshness. 
- Follow proper guidelines for cooling, reheating, and defrosting to maintain food safety.
