**USER MANUAL ERN**

### IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

This instruction manual should be kept for reference. If the appliance is transferred to another owner, it's crucial that they understand its operation and safety information. You MUST refer to the safety guidelines. The appliance is heavy; handle it with care according to the specifications, and ensure it is connected to the appropriate power supply. Avoid exposing it to heat sources. Always follow the guidelines when accessing the back panel and allow sufficient time for it to cool down as instructed. 

Children should not have access to the appliance or its controls during cooling. Position the appliance away from direct sunlight and other heat sources. This manual is specific to this appliance and should not be used for other food preservation methods.

Avoid exposing food to frost or freezer burn. Strictly adhere to the manufacturer’s instructions for use. The cooling plates or shelves should not be interfered with, and do not use sharp tools to remove frost. The appropriate defrosting instructions must be followed to maintain efficiency.

### OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

To operate the appliance, familiarize yourself with the thermostat settings. The thermostat should typically be set to a level that allows effective cooling, taking into account factors such as ambient temperature and the volume of food stored. Adjust the thermostat accordingly, particularly if food begins to thaw or if ambient temperatures are excessively high. 

Always keep in mind that thawed cooked food should not be refrozen. For optimal freshness, set the thermostat appropriately and allow ample cooling time before placing fresh food inside. Ensure that food items are stored properly on the shelves to promote airflow and even cooling.

### MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply. Use a soft cloth and mild cleaning solutions—never abrasive materials or strong chemicals, as these will damage the appliance's surface. Clean all surfaces and components thoroughly to maintain performance.

For defrosting, turn off the thermostat and remove any food items. Allow the frost to melt and use trays to catch excess water. Regularly check for the frost buildup and clean the appliance as required to ensure optimal functioning.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

If the appliance exhibits issues—such as an illuminated light not functioning, excessive frost accumulation, or inadequate cooling—refer to the relevant sections of this manual. Common symptoms may include improper temperature settings or blockages that could hinder airflow. Adjust the thermostat as necessary or consult the Service Force for assistance if problems persist.
