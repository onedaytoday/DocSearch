---

**POST Procedures** involve initial system checks and memory diagnostics. The **NO_EVICTION_MODE_DEBUG** is defined in the file (CommonPlatform\sec\Ia32\SecCore.inc) for handling MTRR cache settings. The BSP (Bootstrap Processor) CR0 settings manage cache disabling (CR0.CD) and no-write allocation (CR0.NW) during memory operations. **DEBUG_BIOS** initializes memory configurations as outlined in (Chipset\Alviso\MemoryInitAsm\IA32\IMEMORY.INC). This includes settings for first memory, MCHBAR, DRAM types (DDR or DDR2), ECC configurations, and latency timings such as TRAS, TRP, TRCD, refresh rates, and memory clock synchronization.

**Dispatch** addresses DRAM interactions and the overall DRAM architecture while initializing ODT memory with details referenced in the corresponding chapter. 

**DLL RCOMP** and DRAM I/O clock settings align with JEDEC memory standards to manage DRAM throttling effectively. The **BDS action** directs SMM operations and BSP SMBASE during every memory ECC initialization, including USB and PS2 interface resets. 

**PEI (Pre-EFI Initialization)** stages include several key modules like PEI_SB_INIT, PEI_MEMORY_INIT, and PEI_CPUTIO, leading into DEE and chipset initialization. Each section handles distinct tasks related to system memory, hardware configuration, and power management.

**BIOS Recovery Procedures** detail methods for clearing memory and recovering from BIOS failures. This involves clearing CMOS for security or restoration and executing recovery sequences from USB if necessary. 

**FRU Units** section outlines parts and assembly components, emphasizing the importance of following security and service protocols during ordering. Each part number is cataloged alongside their respective purpose (e.g., adapters, batteries) for efficient service and repairs.

**Assembly and Components** provide a breakdown of assembly numbers, connector locations, and descriptions for various hardware interfaces (blues, GPUs, memory slots). 

In summary, strict adherence to these guidelines ensures proper functioning, recovery, and servicing of the hardware. Always consult the specified chapters for details regarding initialization, recovery, and replacement to ensure compliance with industry standards.
