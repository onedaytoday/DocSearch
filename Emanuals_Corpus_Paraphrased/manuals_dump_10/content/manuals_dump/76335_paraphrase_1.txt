**9094-21/EN Reference Washer FOM CLS, FOM IEC**

### Introduction
This document outlines the installation inspection and cleaning protocols for the FOM CLS Software, aligned with the IEC standards. It details the inspection procedures and flow management for the laboratory equipment over several months, including emptying flow charts.

### Software Installation
The FOM CLS software has undergone several updates. Key modifications include adjustments in temperature settings, speed calibration (low and high ranges), and backlight functionalities. Ensure all software modifications are implemented correctly based on testing with IEC protocols.

### Inspection Protocol
The inspection of reference components involves ensuring proper clearances and confirming connections via hoses. The hoses should be made of PVC and securely attached to maintain appropriate fluid flow. Verify that the supply meets specified standards during heating.

### Operational Procedures
During operations, ensure all mounts are assembled as per the CLS specifications. Monitor the system's functioning, both manually and automatically, utilizing the service menu to reset trip counters or adjust wash program settings.

### Calibration Processes
Level calibration procedures involve filling water to a desired level and confirming that old settings are overwritten. Be cautious during this process to prevent errors, and ensure the connections are secure for optimal performance.

### Weight Adjustment
For accurate weight readings, make adjustments to the factory settings as necessary, ensuring that the hoses and attachments remain intact and properly oriented. Additionally, follow the guidelines for calibrating load sensors to maintain precision.

### Troubleshooting and Service
If discrepancies arise in system performance, reference the provided tables for error corrections related to temperature and speed calibration. Ensure that proper procedures are followed for adjustments, especially concerning flow rates.

### Functions Overview
The default operational values for various functions are predefined, including time adjustments, temperature settings, and allowed manual operations. Familiarize yourself with the options to activate or modify settings, as well as the implications of each operational mode.

For any changes, it is crucial to consult authorized technicians and adhere strictly to operational protocols to maintain system integrity.

Here's a distilled and technical paraphrase of the provided text:

**Table Function Default Explanation**

The values displayed for "WEIGHT TIMEOUT," "BUZZER TIMEOUT," and "SERVICE ALARM" indicate configurations for the PC5, particularly in blocking heating and spinning operations. The functionality for these operations is not applicable in FOM CLS scenarios. 

The "Ru Start Slow Filling" option enhances measurement accuracy by adjusting the fill rate, while settings for "IS TEMP ADJUST ADD" and "IS TEMP ADJUST SUB" allow for temperature modifications to accommodate higher workloads. 

The "SPEED CALIBRATION" ranges are software-defined, adjusting the readings of low and high RPMs for accuracy. Correct calibration ensures conformity to displayed values.

Regular cleaning of FOM CLS apparatus is essential to remove any debris, lint, or threads that could affect performance. The tubing and connections should be inspected for blockages to maintain heating efficiency. 

Repairs may require specific tools, such as a ratchet wrench, and should be performed only by qualified technicians. Any disassembled components must be meticulously reconnected to ensure optimal function.

Maintaining compliance with IEC specifications is crucial. Procedures for inspections and servicing outlines the necessary controls to monitor heating performance and prevent malfunctions.

The RRT2008 reference tests temperature and heating cycle performances, ensuring protocols align with manufacturer specifications. Results must be documented for verification against standard operational criteria.

**Inspection Protocol**

Inspect the mounting clearances and ensure connections are secure to avoid operational inefficiencies. Regular assessments are recommended to uphold safety and functional standards in line with IEC guidelines.

This paraphrase maintains the essential technical details while improving readability and clarity.

The FOM for the laboratory, along with the attached instructions regarding operations, covers the heating BSP. The laboratory is authorized to manage this heating system, ensuring proper performance. If the flow is too high or too low, adjustments to the internal FOM software may be necessary. In cases of excessive or inadequate flow rates, components may need replacement, and steps should be taken to optimize the flow.

For the FOM Flow associated with ELS, the flow configuration must align with the standard parameters. The K-factor, which impacts installation, should be calibrated as necessary for the specific setup. Procedure B outlines steps to ensure the accuracy of the flow measurements and necessary adjustments according to the reference standards.

Regular maintenance is essential to prevent clogs from lint and threads that can hinder heating performance. The entire system, including supply hoses, should be inspected periodically. Follow the detailed cleaning procedures to remove any buildup and ensure optimal functionality.

Regarding the motor-operated components, it is crucial to maintain proper operation to avoid issues with the cross-sectional flow. Any obstructions should be cleared, and the system should be readily accessible for maintenance.

Documentation specifies regular inspections and maintenance intervals, with particular attention to cleaning procedures. Continuous monitoring helps in identifying any discrepancies in performance metrics, ensuring that all components operate according to their designated specifications. Schedules for cleaning and performance evaluation should be adhered to in order to maintain overall system reliability.
