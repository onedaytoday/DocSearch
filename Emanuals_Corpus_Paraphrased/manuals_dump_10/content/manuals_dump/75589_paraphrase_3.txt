The refrigeration system comprises coolers designed to operate at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C. The units feature insulation of varying thickness and may come with built-in or external components. They are pre-charged for cooling and require assembly knowledge for installation. The latest injection technology enhances performance and ensures high quality. The insulation is made of prepainted polyurethane, and the units are free from CFCs and HCFCs. 

The interiors have rounded corners, and the fast-fit design facilitates assembly. These coolers are engineered for high-efficiency airtightness using PVC, suitable for temperatures up to +43°C and refrigerants R404A, with capabilities for high and low temperature operation. To optimize performance, defrosting is conducted through a heated system designed to minimize ice buildup, complemented by internal lighting rated IP54. 

Key features include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat. The right-hinged doors are equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring airtight closure and enhanced insulation, which helps reduce energy consumption. These units are compliant with HACCP standards.

Accessories include aluminum shelving, door microswitches, energy-free alarm devices, graphic temperature recorders, and HACCP connection kits, alongside a plastic curtain for a 65 cm door clearance. Additional options are available for different cold room configurations.
