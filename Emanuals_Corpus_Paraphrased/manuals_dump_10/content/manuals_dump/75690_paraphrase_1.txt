**Chiller Functionality Overview**

The chiller is designed to reduce the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C in under four hours, effectively minimizing bacterial growth. This process can further lower the temperature to -18°C, ensuring food safety and quality. The unit features a comprehensive performance design that incorporates various operational modes, including soft chilling at +2°C and standard chilling at 20°C.

**Cooling Mechanism**

The ARTE system continuously monitors the cooling process, activating once food is inserted. It is equipped with built-in UV options (available as an accessory) to enhance food preservation, along with defrosting capabilities. The unit also provides countdown timers and service notifications (P1, P2) for each operational phase, ensuring efficient performance and compliance with HACCP standards.

**Construction and Insulation**

The chiller is constructed with AISI stainless steel and high-density polyurethane insulation, ensuring durability and efficiency without HCFCs. It meets ISO standards and features rounded corners for safety. The IP20 rating provides adequate protection for the electrical components.
