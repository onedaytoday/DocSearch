Operation includes features such as auto-contrast adjustments for analog and YUV signals, with access via the graphics DSUB connection, allowing users to toggle between DSUB and DVI displays. The DVI interface also provides clock phase adjustments and additional settings for intensity, saturation, hue, and flesh tone.

The OSD can be configured in various languages, including English and Spanish. It is essential to ensure the interface is properly connected and set up; troubleshooting may require reference to the corresponding chapter in the manual.
