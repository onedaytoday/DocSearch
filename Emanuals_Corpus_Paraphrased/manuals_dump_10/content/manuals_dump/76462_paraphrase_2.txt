**SBB800T Condensing Tankless Gas Water Heater Guidelines**

The SBB800T is a condensing tankless gas water heater designed for safe operation. 

### Safety Warnings
Pay close attention to the provided dangers, warnings, and cautions. Failure to heed these instructions could result in fire hazards, property damage, serious injury, or even death. Ensure compliance with all indicated guidelines to maintain warranty coverage. 

### Installation Components
Included with the heater are various installation components such as screws, optional accessories, and a PVC kit. These should be used accordingly during installation.

### Clearance Requirements
Maintain adequate clearance around the heater and termination points to prevent malfunctions. Specifically, ensure the areas surrounding vents are free of obstructions and allow for proper airflow. Clearances should follow local building codes, especially in residential settings. 

### Combustion and Ventilation
Ensure that combustion air is sourced appropriately and that all terminations are correctly oriented to avoid backdrafting or other issues that could compromise safety. Follow ANSI Z21.10.3-2011/CSA standards.

### Pre-Heater Precautions
Water temperatures may pose scalding risks; avoid operating the heater in locations that do not comply with safety and manufacturer guidelines. 

### Dipswitch settings
Adjust dipswitches as necessary for optimal performance and functionality based on installation requirements. 

### Termination Guidelines
For PVC/CPVC installations, ensure proper alignment and clearance for all terminations. Use additional straps and supports as needed to maintain system integrity.

### Compliance and Recommendations
Follow all national and local codes, including ANSI and NFPA standards, during installation and operation. Consult technical documentation for detailed instructions regarding installations specific to your setup. 

### Final Notes
Review local codes and regulations concerning water heaters. Proper installation and maintenance are crucial for safety and efficiency.

### Water Heater Capacity and Specifications

The water heater's capacity is measured in gallons per hour (GPH) and is referenced in thousands of Water Column (WC). This capacity is solely for informational purposes. The system's water supply should be fully operational, avoiding shorter supply lines, which can affect performance and contribute to combustion issues, as opposed to other chemical factors.

### Water Quality Treatment

Water treatment is necessary for maintaining system efficiency, allowing for procedures such as flushing. It is crucial to perform flushing once water treatment is installed. Optional water treatment configurations should include a shutoff valve for city water supply.

### Installation Guidelines

Ensure proper heat insulation when connecting the water heater. The piping must maintain a designated pitch. It's imperative to avoid adding any valves that may obstruct the flow near the water heater.

### Flow and Heating System

For cold water applications, optional features like a flow switch are recommended. This system should monitor and control flow rates, typically above 85 gallons per minute (GPM). If a specific heating element is used, the temperature should remain 10°F (5°C) below the recommended maximum to prevent scalding.

### Remote Connection

Connect the remote control cord to the unit carefully, ensuring correct wire assignments. A qualified technician should inspect the unit if any operational issues arise.

### Safety and Operational Instructions

Be aware of potential hazards associated with high temperatures and follow safety precautions. The installation of condensate and water drain valves is critical for safe operation.

### Equipment and Components

The provided wall anchors and mounting locations should avoid direct sunlight. Ensure all connectors and cords are correctly aligned and secured for optimal performance.
