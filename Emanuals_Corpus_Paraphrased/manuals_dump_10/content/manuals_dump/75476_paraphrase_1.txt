The cooking mode and the type and quantity of food being prepared can be adjusted using the cooking switch. Cooking will not proceed until the proper function is chosen. Once set, the switch directs the appropriate heat for cooking. Options include frying, steaming, and warming meals such as goulash or searing meat. After use, cleaning is essential to remove any burns or residues. Clean the surface with a damp cloth, ensuring to address splashes or food debris. For plastics or stubborn stains, specialized scrapers and cleaners may be necessary, but they should not scratch the surface.

Always follow the provided instructions to troubleshoot any issues. Incorrect repairs may jeopardize the appliance's function and void the warranty. For maintenance inquiries, please contact an authorized service center. Make sure the cooking switch is deactivated after use to ensure safety.
