### Sorting and Washing Instructions for Laundry

Proper sorting is essential for laundry, especially when dealing with various textiles such as pillowcases, bed linens, and garments. It's important to separate colored items from whites to maintain the whiteness of laundered whites. New colored items should be washed first with similar colors.

#### Item Categorization:
- **Laundry Types**: Items like bathrobes, work shirts, t-shirts, pillowcases, nightgowns/pyjamas, and tablecloths must be sorted by fabric type.
- **Washing Temperatures**: Use a 60°C wash for most items, particularly synthetics and easy-care fabrics, to ensure optimal cleaning results.

#### Treatment of Different Textiles:
- **Delicates**: Handle delicate fabrics with care, utilizing specific wash cycles that cater to these items.
- **Woolens**: Only wash woolens with suitable settings, avoiding regular wash options to prevent damage.

#### Detergents and Additives:
To achieve the best results, employ non-biological detergents like Fairy for whites and colored items, while avoiding bleach unless necessary. For stain removal, products such as VANISH or GloWhite can be effective when added during the wash cycle.

#### Washing Techniques:
- **Traditional vs. Compact Detergents**: Use traditional powders or liquids as recommended, measuring them accurately according to the load size. Compact detergents should be applied as specified on the packaging.
- **Fabric Conditioners**: Incorporate these during washes to enhance softness and manage ease of ironing.

#### Drying Instructions:
Choose the drying method based on the fabric type, as indicated in the user manual or drying chart. Avoid overloading the machine to prevent issues during the drying cycle.

#### Machine Operation:
After selecting the desired wash and drying settings, the appropriate indicators will signify operational phases. In cases of pause or interruption, follow the machine's prompts to resume operations.

#### Emergency Protocol:
In the event of a blockage or system failure, the washing machine should be promptly emptied and cleaned. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions to clear clogs and ensure proper functioning.

### Conclusion
Adherence to these guidelines will enhance laundry performance while preserving the quality of all fabrics and preventing damage during the washing and drying processes. Continuous maintenance of the machine also contributes to its longevity and efficiency.
