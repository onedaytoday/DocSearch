**Upright Household Z5600 Important Information**

For your safety and the functionality of the Upright Household Z5600, please ensure you read and follow these important instructions:

1. **Safety Precautions:** To minimize the risk of electric shock or injury when using or servicing the vacuum, always turn off the switch and unplug the device. Avoid using it as a toy and refrain from running the cord over heated surfaces or sharp corners.

2. **Routine Maintenance:** Regular cleaning and servicing of the device is crucial for optimal performance. Ensure that the cleaning head is free from obstructions and that the hose and thermal components are functioning properly. If overheating occurs, the thermostat will automatically shut off the cleaner—wait for it to cool before turning it back on.

3. **Electrical Safety:** Before connecting to an electrical supply, verify that the voltage matches the rating indicated on the vacuum. The cleaner must be connected to a supply with a 13A fuse. Ensure that wiring follows the appropriate color code: brown for live, blue for neutral, and green/yellow for earth. It's essential to use a properly fused outlet.

4. **Service Information:** If servicing is required, contact Customer Services for assistance. Ensure that any servicing done is authorized to maintain warranty validity. This device is designed to meet household standards and can be recycled at designated facilities.

5. **Assembly Instructions:** When assembling the cleaner, ensure screws are properly placed and components are connected securely. Refer to the user manual for detailed diagrams and steps.

6. **Using the Hose:** Attach and detach the hose carefully to avoid damage. The vacuum is designed for various cleaning tasks, including upholstery and dusting. Avoid excessive stretching of the hose to maintain its integrity.

7. **General Guidelines:** Always keep the cleaner upright and avoid placing it on stairs to prevent accidents. When using attachments, ensure they are compatible and do not create blockages.

**Important:** These instructions are vital for the safe and effective use of your vacuum cleaner. Please retain them for reference.

**Instructions for Maintenance**

When handling the pulley mechanism, ensure to stretch the base appropriately to secure it. To seat the front screws, please proceed with caution: switch off the device and release the rotation before addressing the top assembly to ensure it is secured. For optimal performance, it’s important to clean the pleated components thoroughly. Clean the pleated assembly using a cloth, ensuring all sections are complete. 

To remove the cyclonic dust cup from the cleaner body, refer to the appropriate page for emptying instructions. Make sure that the assembly is firmly seated at the front of the cleaner. 

**Caution:** The pleated assembly should be washed carefully with a cloth. 

**Micron Filter Maintenance:** Check and replace the Micron filters as necessary. For HEPA filters, ensure they are properly inserted and secured in the housing. 

**Troubleshooting:** If you experience reduced suction or other operational issues, check for clogs in the hose which may impede airflow. Clean the hose thoroughly and inspect it for wear. Adjust the height settings appropriately to enhance performance.
