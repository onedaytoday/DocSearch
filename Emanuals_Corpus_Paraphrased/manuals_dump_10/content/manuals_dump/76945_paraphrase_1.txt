### Standard Exhaust Fan
The standard exhaust fan, rated at 350 cfm, is pre-configured to circulate air through a charcoal filter. It can also vent to the outside if ducting does not exceed one 90-degree bend or a length of ten feet from the range to the exterior wall. Note that this fan only exhausts air from the back and cannot be adapted for top venting.

**Exhaust Outlet Location:** 
- Height from the floor to the center of the duct opening is 62 5/8". 
- If installing in a 30 1/4" opening, the dimension should be 8 5/8".

#### Optional In-Line Exhaust Blower
This optional blower replaces the standard 350 cfm unit and must be installed by your contractor where the exhaust duct exits the building. It is recommended for installations with more than ten feet of ducting or multiple bends. The #1518 In-Line Blower efficiently removes smoke and odors, capable of exhausting up to 35 feet from the range. Its design allows for vertical, horizontal, or angled mounting while maintaining low noise levels.

**Specifications:**
- Current Rating: 1.85 Amps
- Frequency: 60Hz
- Diameter: 13-1/2" (with an electrical box extending 1-3/4" D x 4-1/2" W)
- Inlet/Outlet: 8"

**Warranty:** One-year warranty covering parts and labor, with an option for an additional four-year warranty.

### Important Notes
- For new constructions, a four-wire range cord is required, while three-wire cords may be used in existing constructions.
- The electrical receptacle and gas piping should be positioned approximately 4 inches above the floor and 15 inches to the right from the left side of the cabinet opening.

### Safety and Efficiency
Elmira Stove Works appliances are designed to exceed U.S. safety and efficiency standards. 

### Range Dimensions
- For a four-burner model, allow for at least a 33" opening between base cabinets and a minimum height of 31" for short leg models.
- Six-burner models require a 45-1/2" opening, with standard countertop heights of 36".

### In-Line Exhaust Blower Installation Notes
- Ensure proper ducting and flashing are included for efficient installation, regardless of the location (basement or roof). Adjustments may be needed based on building structure and preferences.
