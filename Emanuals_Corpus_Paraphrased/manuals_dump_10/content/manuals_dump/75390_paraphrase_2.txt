### Guidelines for Using Your Traditional Oven

**Preheating**: Always preheat the oven as specified, since this is critical for achieving the desired cooking results, particularly for cakes. A toothpick can be used to check if cakes are fully cooked.

**Cooking Meat**: Meat should be optimally cooked to prevent toughness. If using roasts, ensure they are not overly exposed to high heat, which can lead to drying out. Begin roasting at a higher temperature and then reduce it to achieve even cooking. Utilize a meat thermometer for accuracy.

**Cooking Times**: Refer to the cooking time table for various items, including cakes, pastries, meringues, and different meats such as roasts, meatballs, and poultry.

### Maintenance

**Cleaning**: Wipe any spills promptly with a soft cloth to maintain the oven's appearance. For cleaning scratches, use gentle products and avoid abrasive materials. Allow plates to cool before cleaning, using special cleaning cloths designed for ovens. Follow manufacturer instructions for best results.

**Catalytic Cleaning**: For ovens with catalytic sides, heat the oven empty at 220Â°C for a specified duration to self-clean any grease or food residue.
