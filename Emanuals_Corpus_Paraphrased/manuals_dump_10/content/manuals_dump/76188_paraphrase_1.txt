**Installation and Operation Instructions**

When securing screws, ensure they are mounted at the designated top location. The notches should face downwards towards the round area. To provide an airtight seal, apply grease carefully to avoid electric shock risks. Always comply with safety regulations and building codes. 

**Important Safety Note**: Turn off the electricity prior to installation or cleaning. Ground connections must align with the screws â€“ typically, black screws correspond to the live wire, while white screws are for grounding. Ensure that pre-assembled grounding is properly attached.

For optimal operation, ensure there's a fresh supply of combustion air if the system is used near potentially combustible materials such as wood or fabric. If operating combustion appliances (like heaters), ensure fresh air is circulating.

The unit should be cleaned monthly to maintain efficiency and prevent fire hazards. Grease buildup can significantly impact performance. Refer to the user manual for cleaning methods, including appropriate products.
