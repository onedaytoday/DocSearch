### Overview of Food Cooking and Safety Functions

#### Food Internal Temperature Checking
Ensuring that food is properly cooked is essential. For meats, it is important to check the thickest part, including areas near the bone. The following internal temperatures are crucial for safety: 

- 170°F (76°C)
- 130°F (54°C)
- 210°F (98°C)

To confirm that food is cooked safely, use a thermometer, allowing the probe to reach the thickest part of the meat. It’s vital to ensure the probe is correctly connected during cooking. Always fully defrost food before cooking to avoid burns.

To monitor internal temperatures, set the device to 180°F (82°C) and press the appropriate buttons: UPPER OVEN, CONV ROAST, COOK OPTIONS, PROBE, and START. Once the desired internal temperature is achieved, remember to cancel the probe feature.

#### Convection Cooking
Utilizing convection heating allows for even cooking of thicker foods. The relevant temperature settings include:

- 550°F (288°C)
- 300°F (148°C)

Be cautious; ensure the oven door is closed during cooking. If a fire occurs, extinguish it properly to prevent injury. To begin convection cooking, set the oven immediately by selecting the UPPER OVEN, CONV BROIL, and pressing START. You can cancel at any time during cooking.

#### Food Safety Protocols
When cooking food, always adhere to the appropriate temperature guidelines to prevent food poisoning:

- 170°F (76°C)
- 150°F (66°C)

Ensure food is not left out for more than an hour to minimize bacterial growth. Watch for grease when roasting and reheating, and use the KEEP WARM setting if necessary.

#### Slow Cooking
Slow cooking of various foods should be done cautiously. Recommended temperatures include:

- HI: 275°F (134°C)
- LO: 225°F (108°C)

Thaw food completely before cooking and preheat as needed. To utilize the slow-cook function, press UPPER OVEN, SLOW COOK, choose the desired setting, and press START. Make necessary adjustments as cooking progresses.

#### Poultry Cooking Guidelines
Proper roasting ensures poultry is cooked thoroughly. Follow these temperature guidelines:

- Minimum roasting at 325°F (163°C)
- Internal temperature of 180°F (82°C)

Use the probe for accurate readings. Remember to start the probe feature early in the cooking process for best results.

#### Defrosting Food
To defrost food effectively, press UPPER OVEN, DEFROST, and START. Make adjustments as necessary, and monitor temperatures to ensure even defrosting, especially with thinner cuts of meat.

#### Yeast-Leavened Products
For optimal results with yeast-leavened goods, use the following temperatures:

- 100°F (38°C) for prepping

Lightly cover the items and select UPPER OVEN, BREAD PROOF, and START. You can cancel at any time.

#### User-Friendly Cooking Modes
The interface allows for easy selection of cooking instructions across various functions. If adjustments are needed, simply make selections using the UPPER OVEN and MY FAVORITE buttons, following prompts as required.

**Safety Precautions for Cooking**

Ensure the safety of children by keeping them away from the lower oven when it is hot to prevent burns. It is crucial to avoid using aluminum foil to line the oven drawer or cover the oven racks. This could interfere with the cooking process and cause food to burn due to incorrect height placement. To properly clean the oven and surrounding areas, use appropriate heat-proof cookware and utensils.

In case of a fire during cooking, utilize a fire extinguisher or turn off the oven immediately. For optimal performance, repeat heating cycles may adjust as cooking progresses.

When setting cooking temperatures, use the following guidelines:
- For baking: Press LOWER OVEN > BAKE > START at 350°F (176°C).
- For warming: Adjust settings to keep food at 170°F (76°C) or higher, avoiding foodborne illness.

The self-cleaning cycle should not involve using cleaners or products that may damage the oven’s interior surfaces. Remove oven racks before initiating the self-cleaning function. After the cycle, allow the oven to cool before opening.

**User Preferences and Cleaning**

The oven features adjustable user preferences including clock settings, cooking temperature offsets, and audible signals. To modify any preference, follow the prompts for USER PREF. 

For self-cleaning:
- Choose between light, medium, or heavy cleaning modes via the UPPER OVEN > CLEAN options.
- The cleaning process will lock the door and a cooling period will ensue afterward.

To maintain the oven’s exterior and components, refer to specific cleaning guidelines to prevent scratches and maintain functionality. Use suitable cloths and cleaners recommended for painted or chrome surfaces to avoid damage.
