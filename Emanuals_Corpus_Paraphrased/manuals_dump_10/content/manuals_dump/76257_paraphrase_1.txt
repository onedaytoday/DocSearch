The following instructions are designed to guide you in operating and maintaining the device effectively. Begin by selecting the desired program and confirming your selection by pressing the appropriate button. If the device is locked, check if it has already begun the heating process or if the temperature is too high; this could prevent changes. 

In case it becomes necessary to turn off the device, first ensure that it is safe to do so. The light indicator will automatically deactivate after a select period, accompanied by an acoustic signal. If you have chosen certain options, the relevant LED indicators will illuminate accordingly.

To manage the washing processes, consider the following programs: 

- **COLD WASH (KATOEN)**: Ideal for mixed white and colored items, effective at 60°C.
- **HYGIENE**: Specifically for white clothing, designed for optimal cleanliness, utilizing a 60°C wash.
- **JEANS COLD**: Tailored for denim items and engaging high-tech functions automatically.

You may also utilize various settings such as **SPIN REDUCTION**, **RINSE HOLD**, **PREWASH**, **STAIN REMOVAL**, and **EXTRA RINSE**, depending on your needs. Each setting or program tailors the washing process to effectively manage specific fabric types and cleaning requirements.

To ensure efficient use, sort your laundry into categories: whites, coloreds, synthetics, and specific items like towels or tablecloths. It is recommended to wash new colored items separately to prevent color transfer. Utilize care recommendations for stubborn stains and follow the suggested temperatures for various fabric types.

For maintenance, regularly clean the door seals, detergent compartments, and filters to ensure optimal performance. If using additives or special treatments, ensure compatibility with your washing conditions.

For troubleshooting, concerns such as a non-responsive device, locked settings, or indicators signaling errors may arise. Immediately check whether the door and hose connections are securely closed and free from blockages. In cases of emergency drainage, refer to the specific procedures to manage the emptying of water safely.

Always follow the manufacturer's safety instructions and guidelines for care and cleaning to prolong the lifespan of your device and maintain its efficiency.

**Troubleshooting and Maintenance Instructions** 

If you encounter an issue, check the hose for clogs and clear any obstructions. Ensure that the hose connections are secure and that the selected settings align with the cleaning phases required. If the distribution seems uneven or if one option is overused, manually redistribute items to maintain efficiency. 

Examine the hose for proper installation and verify that it is not hindering drainage. If necessary, clean or replace the hose if it’s damaged or improperly fitted. For stubborn residues, consider using specialized cleaning products as recommended.
