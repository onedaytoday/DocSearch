### C.1.4 PROGRAMS

Use the switches to select between the cooling modes P1 and P2. Each mode is designed for regulating the temperature in the chamber and facilitates both chilling and defrosting. 

#### C.1.4.1 Chilling with Cooling
The cooling system can achieve temperatures as low as -32.8°F (-36°C) and as high as +37.4°F (+3°C), operating continuously with automatic defrosting capabilities. 

#### C.1.4.2 EICE Function
The EICE can be toggled between P1 and P2 from the main menu. Depending on the selected mode, the system can be turned off. For P1, a chilling temperature of -6.8°F (-14°C) is set, while P2 provides a chilling temperature of 3.2°F (-16°C). Refer to section C.1.9.5 for additional details.

#### C.1.5 TEMPERATURE INDICATORS
The temperatures for both the chamber and the food are monitored. If chilling is active, the chamber temperature is displayed, alongside the food temperature. An indicator light will show which temperature is currently being displayed. 

#### C.1.6 ALARM WARNING
The light indicators will illuminate when HACCP criteria are met. The type and nature of alerts are detailed in section C.1.9. 

#### C.1.7 STANDARDS
The standard light typically remains off but will illuminate when in reference mode. For further reference, consult sections C.1.9 and C.1.9.4 for operational guidelines.

#### C.1.8 TIMED CYCLES
The indicator light reflects the duration of chilling or defrosting cycles. For instance, it shows how long has been spent defrosting. 

#### C.1.9 UTILITIES FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS
1. **Manual Defrosting**: Can be activated via the right switch; the light will indicate the status.
2. **Probe Temperature Display**: Shows the temperature of food items when selected.
3. **UV Sterilization Cycle**: Activates sterilization features; refer to section B.1.4 for operational details.
4. **Reference Standard**: Adheres to NSF guidelines for food safety, detailing acceptable temperature ranges for chilling.
5. **User Parameters Editing**: Allows users to adjust settings while the machine is idle.

### C.2 USER INSTRUCTIONS 
#### C.2.1 SWICHING ON
