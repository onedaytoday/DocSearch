**Diversity Overview**

This document provides important details about diversity in various contexts, specifically focusing on the integration of information from multiple sources. 

**Warning:** Ensure the device is correctly set up before proceeding. If any issues arise, check the instructions related to USB CD Activation (IEC, MCX).

Diversity is enhanced through the use of Digital Signal Processing (DSP), which enables effective reception in areas with high DTT coverage. DTT receivers are designed to operate alongside other devices, streamlining connectivity. When devices are linked, ensure that they are actively engaged in the settings.

To connect the USB, remove protective coverings and follow the instructions provided on the accompanying software CD. Ensure that the USB is properly inserted, either directly or through included accessories, to activate the diversity features. 

Refer to the appropriate section in the device preferences to manage these settings and ensure optimal performance of your DTT receiver.

**Software Requirements:**
- Ensure compatibility with USB-enabled computers.
- Follow the software CD instructions carefully for successful installation and setup.
