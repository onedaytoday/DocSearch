### Strobe Installation for ELK-1RT or ELK-150RT Stainless Steel Box

**A)** If the ELK stainless steel box is already installed, remove the front cover (there's no need to detach the speaker). For new siren box installations, mount the stainless steel backplate and speaker/siren per the provided instructions.  
 
**B)** Attach the strobe unit to the lower flange of the backplate by sliding the clear plastic wiring protector into the left (outer) slot. Ensure the end with the loose wires is facing you and oriented upwards. Confirm that the wire slide is fully pushed against the wall. 

**C)** Connect the red (12V+) and black wires from the strobe to the non-pulsed alarm output or violation output. Note that while most pulsed outputs will operate the strobe, the flash rate may be slightly irregular. 

**Specifications**  
- **Operating Voltage:** D.C.  
- **Current Drain:** Approx.  
- **Flash Rate:** Approx. flashes per second  
- **Note:** Not for continuous applications.
