Here is a technical paraphrase of the given text:

The drying process begins as soon as the selected cycle is activated. During the drying phase, the system redistributes items, including towels and shirts, ensuring that they dry evenly. Indicators will activate, showing three lights that confirm the phase is locked. If you want to switch to another drying phase, such as the anti-crease option, you can do so by turning the system off and selecting the desired phase. 

When sorting items for drying, follow these guidelines: whites and colored garments should be washed separately before drying. Stubborn stains may require pre-treatment, such as soaking overnight with a suitable detergent before washing. For grease stains or similar issues, treating them with appropriate fabric care products is recommended. 

The washing temperatures should follow these general guidelines: cotton items can be washed at up to 90°C, synthetic materials at 60°C, and delicates at lower temperatures (40°C). Always ensure that you are using the correct program for each item type, including prewash if needed for heavily soiled items. 

Special care should be taken for lightweight items and textiles prone to static, such as lingerie and silk. Manual redistribution may be necessary for items like jeans and wool if they become tangled during the cycle. The system’s various programs include specific options for night cycles, extra rinses, and spin hold features. 

Regular maintenance, including cleaning the lint filter and hose, is crucial for optimal performance. Any obstructions in the drainage system should be cleared to prevent malfunction. 

In case of errors or abnormal operation, indicators will alert you with sounds or flashing lights, guiding you to troubleshoot or consult service instructions. Always ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply before performing any maintenance work.

The following provides technical guidance on handling operational issues:

Ensure that connections are secure, particularly focusing on the E40 component, which must be tightened properly. If the system shows an E10 error, check the hose for blockages. In the case of an E20 error, clean the hose thoroughly, as it may be obstructed. Immediate washing is necessary if prompted, and the child lock feature can be activated or deactivated as needed.

It's important to redistribute items evenly within the system, particularly if there is an overload or imbalance. In the event of flow issues, check that hoses are properly connected and positioned, and ensure they are free from kinks and obstructions. For effective cleaning actions, make sure hoses are correctly screwed in and that all components are functioning correctly.

Be mindful of the water supply and hose connections, ensuring they align with specified procedures. If items remain unsold, consult service information for support. Adjustments or replacements should be undertaken following the outlined safety protocols to maintain operational efficiency.

For recycling and disposal, please adhere to local regulations regarding household waste. If your equipment requires servicing, refer to the manufacturer's guidelines for necessary information and procedures.
