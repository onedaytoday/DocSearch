**MAINTAINING YOUR WINE COOLER: Cleaning and Efficiency for Optimal Performance**

To ensure your wine cooler operates efficiently and maintains its longevity, regular cleaning is essential. Use a high-quality cleaner or polish specifically designed for stainless steel. Avoid using bleach or other harsh chemicals. Monthly maintenance is recommended, but refrain from using steel wool pads or cleaners not meant for stainless steel, as they can damage the finish. If necessary, gentle scrubbing with Bon-Ami or a suitable stainless steel cleaner and soft cloth is advised. Aggressive scrubbing pads, like Scotch-Brite, can blur the stainless steel grain.

**Wine Rack Removal/Installation**

For cleaning, remove the wine racks as follows: Ensure the unit is unplugged, then carefully unscrew and detach the racks, keeping a firm grip to avoid dropping screws. Clean both the racks and the interior of the cooler appropriately. When changing the light bulb, remove the housing cover carefully. You should hear a click indicating proper reinstallation.

If the unit appears to malfunction, first go through the standard operation checks. If issues persist, refer to the troubleshooting guide outlined in the manual. Consult an authorized service provider if needed, and ensure you have your purchase details and model information ready.
