Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a natural, technical manner:

The buttons on the appliance are linked to control the transition from the CURRENT to the DESIRED temperature settings, indicated by flashing lights (WARMER or COLDER). By pressing these buttons, the temperature will adjust to match the DESIRED setting. The CURRENT temperature is displayed with numerical indicators. When the FROSTMATIC or COOLMATIC functions are activated, the display will show the relevant status during their operation. Pressing the WARMER or COLDER buttons will activate status indicators, such as "SF," which can suggest that the food is partially thawed or defrosted. The system may also signal a WARNING if the warmest food temperature surpasses a preset limit.

When the FROSTMATIC function is engaged, the appliance will operate in a cooling capacity mode. Should the COOLMATIC feature be selected, it will maintain a specific temperature profile as indicated on the display. You can manually terminate these functions to revert to normal operation if desired. The appliance does a systematic check of the cooling setting and adjusts accordingly.

In the event of a power interruption or malfunction, proper steps for a safe shutdown must be followed. The WARNING status can be acknowledged or disabled based on whether the temperature criteria are met. Temperature warnings will activate if food exceeds a certain threshold, prompting user action.

For effective food storage, adhere to the guidelines for maximum capacities and pre-cooling methods as recommended. Use airtight containers for sensitive items and ensure proper organization according to the cooling specifications. Adjustments should be made based on the types of food being stored to maintain freshness. Proper use of the cooling system helps retain food quality and prevents spoilage.

For optimal use, a detailed reference for food types, preparation guidelines, and associated temperature settings with the appliance's capabilities should be consulted to ensure efficiency.

**Interior Cleaning and Maintenance Recommendations**

Regular cleaning of the interior is essential for optimal functionality. Caution: Always ensure the device is powered off before cleaning to avoid electrical shock! Unplug the unit or switch it off completely before using any cleaning agents. Pay special attention to the back of the appliance during the cleaning and defrosting processes. Use only approved, non-corrosive cleaners to avoid damage.

For effective cleaning, activate the FROSTMATIC function for several hours; this prepares the appliance for cleaning by making the frost easier to handle. Use newspaper to cover any exposed areas, and switch off the appliance by holding the ON/OFF button for a few seconds.

When handling food, allow it to cool before storing it inside, to prevent the appliance from overheating. Clean the interior thoroughly as often as needed, ensuring you maintain both the performance and hygiene of the unit.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**

Follow these instructions for addressing potential malfunctions. Only trained personnel should attempt repairs. If the appliance enters standby mode and the warning light blinks, as indicated by the display, check for malfunctions such as blown fuses or partial/complete thawing alerts. 

If the appliance has been improperly sealed or if high temperatures have been detected, corrective measures should be taken immediately as outlined in this manual. If warning lights such as F7 or F8 appear, refer to the relevant section for further clarification.

For optimal temperature maintenance, ensure that foods stored do not exceed 50°C. If cooling issues persist even after activating FROSTMATIC or adjusting settings, a more thorough investigation may be required.

The specifications for electrical operation (e.g., voltage, wattage) must be adhered to, and the appliance should be switched off using the ON/OFF button for safety.

**Regulatory Compliance**

This appliance conforms to all applicable EU regulations, including EMV and safety standards. It is important to follow these guidelines to ensure the safe operation of the unit.

**Customer Support Information**

If malfunctions arise despite following these guidelines, contact customer service with the model and serial number (PNC) to obtain assistance. This information can be found on the rating label of the appliance, and providing it to the service personnel will expedite the troubleshooting process.
