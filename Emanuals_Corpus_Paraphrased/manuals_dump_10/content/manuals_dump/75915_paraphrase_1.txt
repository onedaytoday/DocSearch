## Operating Instructions

### Controls
The AES system manages energy supply selection, allowing you to choose between LP gas and electric power. The operation is indicated by the LED lights, which denote the active power source.

### Starting the Refrigerator
Follow the steps for activating the refrigerator by selecting your preferred mode on the switch. Make sure the power source is connected properly and inspect the data plate for specifications.

### Switching Between Energy Sources
To switch energy sources, turn off the current mode before activating the preferred one. This ensures optimal cooling efficiency while switching between AC and DC sources.

### Winter Operation
Utilize winter covers for efficient performance when temperatures drop below 10°C. This prevents cooling issues during colder months.

### Regulating the Temperature
Adjust the thermostat for desired cooling levels. Refrigeration will stabilize quicker if items are pre-cooled prior to loading.

### Travel Catch
Ensure the travel catch is secured to keep the door closed during transit, preventing heat loss and maintaining air circulation.

### Food Storage
Store food items carefully to avoid spoilage. Ensure that doors are tightly closed, and keep items away from the cooling vents to prevent freezing.

### Ice Making
Ensure the refrigerator is set to an appropriate temperature for effective ice production. 

### Defrosting
Regularly check and defrost to prevent excessive frost buildup that can impair functionality. Be cautious with perishable items during this process.

### Cleaning the Refrigerator
Keep the interior clean with a mild detergent and avoid abrasive materials that could damage the surfaces. Remember to turn off the unit during cleaning.

### Turning Off the Refrigerator
Switch off the refrigerator using the main power switch and empty it before storing, particularly if it will not be used for an extended period.

### Troubleshooting
If the refrigerator does not operate as expected, check the AES LED indicators, ensuring connections and power sources are intact. Consult the troubleshooting section for additional guidance.

## Guarantee and Service
Your refrigerator comes with a one-year guarantee. For service details, refer to the directory provided with the product.

Follow maintenance protocols as per authorized guidelines. Regular checks are advised to comply with DVGW G607 regulations.

## Installation Instructions

### Repositioning Hinges
To change hinge placement, unscrew and relocate the necessary components, reassemble them properly to ensure a secure fit.

### Installation/Building-In
Ensure the refrigerator is installed in a well-ventilated area to prevent excess heat buildup, which can affect performance.

### Ventilation of the Unit
Adequate ventilation is crucial for optimal system operation. Ensure air circulation around the unit is maintained.

Here’s a paraphrased version of the provided text with a focus on maintaining its technical integrity:

This unit is designed to allow easy access for inspection and repair without needing to remove it from the recess. The outer section of the vehicle should be sealed off, particularly during winter, to ensure optimal functionality. This type of unit should not have integrated features and needs to be covered as specified, in order to effectively manage heat dissipation.

**Technical Specifications:**

1. **LP Gas Connection**: The LP gas connection must meet the outlined requirements. It is advised to use a continuously operating bottled-gas system with threaded connections. Avoid using push-on connections; they are not suitable for permanent installations in the United States. The gas supply must connect securely to the appropriate threaded coupling and be equipped with an LPG shut-off valve for ease of servicing.

2. **Electrical Connection**: Ensure all electrical wiring is properly grounded and conforms to the latest I.E.E. regulations. Include suitable outlets and couplers that meet BS4343/CEE17 standards. The power supply must be earthed correctly, with outlets positioned within easy reach of the lead. Wire colors must follow the standard: the GREEN-AND-YELLOW wire for earth, the BLUE wire for neutral, and the BROWN wire for live connections. 

   **Note**: It is essential to ensure the appliance is earthed. If using fuses, comply with the specified ratings for your country. Connect the (+12V) directly to the vehicle's battery. Any high-voltage connections should be carefully routed to avoid interference with the vehicle's electrical system.

**Interior Light Replacement**: If it is necessary to replace the interior light bulb, follow these steps: remove the cover by unscrewing it, and carefully replace the bulb before reattaching the cover.
