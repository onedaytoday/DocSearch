### Operational Guidance
Initial setup requires a warm-up period for proper cooling. The appliance features settings for COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC functions, which should be adjusted using the designated buttons. Check temperatures regularly, indicated visually through LED displays for accurate settings.

If any warning lights activate, please take immediate action as described in the operational section to avoid any potential hazards. 

For detailed operational instructions and maintenance, please refer to the respective sections within this manual.

**COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Functions**

The COOLMATIC function is designed to optimize the cooling process of selected items. When activated, a yellow light indicates that the COOLMATIC function is in use. You can manually switch this function on or off, which will run for a specific duration—typically a few hours—based on your desired temperature setting.

Similarly, the FROSTMATIC function is intended for freezing fresh food products, ensuring they remain protected. This function can be activated by pressing the FROSTMATIC button, which is also indicated by a yellow light. If switched on manually, it will operate for a set number of hours before shutting off automatically.

**Switching the Appliance On/Off**

To turn off the appliance, hold both the ON and OFF buttons for a few seconds. The appliance will enter a countdown mode, after which it will switch off completely. 

Be aware that unintentional closing of the door can lead to spoilage and mold growth. To mitigate this, be sure to regularly check the appliance and maintain cleanliness, especially in situations of prolonged absence.

**Temperature Monitoring**

To ensure proper food preservation, regularly monitor the temperature using a thermometer. Items should be stored at or below 0°C to prevent spoilage. The appliance may emit acoustic warnings if the internal temperature exceeds safe limits or if the door remains open for too long. The warning can be silenced by pressing the WARNING OFF button.

**Shelving and Organization**

The shelves in the appliance are adjustable to accommodate various food items. For optimal placement, ensure that taller items are positioned at the back, allowing smaller items to be stored in the front. Additional shelves can be used to maximize space utilization.

**Defrosting**

Defrosting is important to maintain optimal operation. If frost buildup exceeds a certain thickness, it is recommended to defrost the appliance. The collected water will drain through a trough located at the back of the appliance.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply. When cleaning, avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could damage surfaces. Regular maintenance will prolong the appliance's lifespan and ensure effective operation.

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any operational issues, such as unusual sounds or temperature warnings, refer to the troubleshooting section of the manual or contact customer service for assistance. It’s essential to address these warnings promptly to maintain food safety and appliance performance.

**Paraphrase:**

**Frost and Normal Operation Sounds**

If there is a frost issue, customers using AEG Service Force should be aware that it indicates a mechanical failure or breakdown. It's important to understand technical terminology related to cooling systems. These systems typically maintain a stable temperature by removing heat from food or other materials, creating a closed environment that keeps the contents cool. 

Heat is continually extracted, allowing the system to function effectively. The heater is incorporated into the design, located at the rear of the unit. During normal operation, heat is dispelled into the surrounding area. 

**Regulatory Compliance**

This product meets household safety standards, as outlined by various regulations (GSG, VBG, VDE, and EU directives 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG, including 92/31/EWG). AEG provides coverage for the first buyer, valid for a specified number of months from the date of purchase. This warranty encompasses defects in materials and workmanship but excludes issues arising from unauthorized repairs or improper installation.

If any repairs are needed, the purchaser must inform either the service office or an authorized AEG repair center. AEG reserves the right to take ownership of any parts that are replaced during repairs.
