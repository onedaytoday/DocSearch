To activate the temperature adjustment, press (C) until the display shows +8°C for the compartment marked H. This feature allows for minor adjustments in function. If there’s a malfunction, ensure that the appliance is not in contact with anything that could obstruct its operation. Keep the lowest shelf empty, and organize food items efficiently, placing them according to required height specifications. 

Warning! There is a risk of electric shock! Turn off the light switch located at the back before performing any maintenance. To clean the light fixture, gently remove the cover following the indicated instructions. The shelves include a humidity control element, maintaining optimal conditions for both warmer and cooler items.

For addressing any malfunctions or service issues, be aware that repairs should only be conducted according to listed guidelines. Ensure the appliance is cooled adequately, and switch it off if necessary. If certain food items are becoming excessively cold, check for blown fuses or defective components. 

Ensure food is properly covered and organized to prevent overlapping, allowing for better operational efficiency. Regularly clean the appliance using manufacturer-approved cleaning agents and maintain appropriate environmental conditions to prevent frost buildup. 

The FROSTMATIC function should be activated when freezing fresh items. It engages automatically and can also be operated manually. If frost accumulation is significant, defrosting should be performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. 

When preparing ice cubes, use appropriate containers and allow them to cool properly before freezing. Avoid overloading the appliance, and ensure that bottles are not filled too tightly, as they may burst under pressure. It’s essential to pre-treat certain foods before freezing to maintain quality.

Accumulated frost should be monitored, and defrosting should occur when it reaches a certain thickness. Adjust the thermostat to the appropriate setting to facilitate this process, and take care when defrosting items not listed in the guidelines.

Upon completion of the defrosting process, remove food items and place them on layers of newspaper. After defrosting, ensure to turn off the appliance. Warning lights may activate during this process to indicate the defrosting status, and sounds may also occur. To return to normal operation, switch off the appliance and follow the countdown instructions to power down.
