The LW GN series combines traditional cooking techniques with research-driven creativity, offering high operational versatility. The Cook & Chill system is specifically designed for tailored food preparation. The GN operating modes utilize convection heating to cook meat without drying it out while featuring a half-power function that enhances steam cooking efficiency. This method not only reduces cooking time but also minimizes food weight loss.

Additionally, the system accommodates specific food types like cakes with its HOLD feature, ensuring that food is maintained at safe temperatures without compromising quality. The built-in cooling system facilitates efficient cleaning, allowing for easier maintenance compared to prior models. The HACCP-compliant design also supports cooking record documentation.

Key technical specifications include supply options for LPG, built-in cleaning mechanisms, V and N dimensions, as well as weight and cooking chamber height. Enhanced cooking performance is achieved through bi-functional heating and efficient airflow management, ensuring consistent results. 

The design includes temperature regulation features and robust construction materials such as thermo-glazed baking trays for safety and durability. Multiple accessories are available, from GN grids for whole chickens to various baking trays and automated water softeners, enhancing the overall versatility of the LW GN system.

Additional options such as adjustable feet, HACCP integration, and conversion kits for gas types further support operational flexibility, while non-stick pans and customizable racks streamline food preparation processes. All components are optimized for user convenience and effective food service management.
