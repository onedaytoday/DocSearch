Ensure the turntable is correctly positioned and the door is securely closed. The microwave light activates during operation. To adjust the light, briefly touch the button once for high, three times for medium, and four times to turn it off. 

**Control Panel**  
The panel provides information regarding the functions and operation. When setting the clock, press the "Clear" and then the "Clock" buttons. Choose the appropriate A.M. or P.M. setting. If the incorrect time is displayed, the "Error" message may appear. To reset, use the "Stop/Clear" button to input the correct time.

**Cooking Functions**  
Touch the "START" button to initiate cooking or reheating. You can set intervals in seconds; after each touch, the time will increase accordingly. To pause the cooking, press "Stop/Clear," which will suspend rather than cancel the operation. 

**Repositioning Food**  
For even heating, occasionally reposition the food during the cooking or reheating process. This ensures uniformity, especially when using Sensor or Auto Modes. When utilizing these modes, microwave-safe cookware is recommended.

**Manual Operation and Defrosting**  
For manual cooking, follow guidelines for recommended cooking times and temperatures for various food items, particularly meats and seafood. If defrosting, refer to the Defrost chart and input the food weight accurately. Ensure proper handling and cleaning of the microwave interior afterward.

**Covering Foods**  
Cover food loosely to allow steam to escape without compromising moisture retention. Ideally, leave at least a one-inch gap when using wraps or lids.
