Ensure that these instructions are followed carefully for safe operation and optimal performance of your oven.

### Instructions for Oven Operation

**General Controls:**
- Utilize settings such as **Upper Roast**, **Locked**, **Warm**, **Bake**, **Delay**, **Convection**, **Broil**, **Upper Timer**, **Remove Lower Door**, and **Clean Racks** as needed.

**Preheating Guidelines:**
- If preheating is required, follow the specified instructions. Preheat to temperatures ranging from 77°C to 288°C (approximately 170°F to 550°F). For optimal cooking, set the temperature to 350°F when preparing most foods.
- If the **Convection** or **Broil** options are used, select settings accordingly instead of the standard bake.

**Operating Instructions:**
1. When prompted, press **Upper** and **Bake** simultaneously. If the symbols for **Upper** and **Bake** flash, continue to wait for the oven to reach the desired temperature.
2. Expect a notification sound when the preheating phase is complete.
3. If cooking multiple items, ensure to provide adequate space on racks to prevent overheating or uneven cooking.

**Convection Cooking:**
- For convection baking, reduce cooking time for certain foods, especially baked goods, based on experience or testing with specific items.
- Maintain a flow of hot air around the food to facilitate fast and even cooking.
- Avoid overcrowding the oven to ensure that heat circulates properly.

**Batch Cooking:**
- For defrosting and other specific tasks, consult the cooking charts to determine cooking times and temperatures. 

**Delayed Baking Instructions:**
- Utilize the **Delayed Bake** feature for timed cooking of dishes like meat or poultry. Foods should be promptly handled to minimize the risk of foodborne illness.
- To cancel the delay, manually turn off the oven if necessary.

**Convection Convert Feature:**
- The **Convection Convert** option adjusts settings for optimal performance. When using this feature, foods may require a lower temperature setting (approximately 25°F/12°C lower) than standard baking.

**Note:**
Closely monitor the cooking process, adjust as necessary, and ensure proper clearance for each dish. Inspect all racks for fitting and secure seating to avoid warping. For best results, utilize preheating and validate the temperature with the provided sound alerts.

**Setting Timed Bake, Timed Convection Bake, or Timed Convection Roast**

To set a timed cooking function, select the desired bake mode and specify the cooking duration. This mode allows your food to cook at a designated temperature and turn off automatically upon completion. To initiate, set the temperature to 350°F and place the food on the appropriate rack(s). Then, press the "UPPER" and "BAKE" buttons until the indicators appear. 

Follow the prompts to enter the desired cooking time, then press "START." The oven will sound when it completes the cooking cycle. Make sure to promptly consume cooked food to avoid foodborne illness.

**Setting Delayed Timed Bake or Delayed Timed Convection Bake**

If you need to delay cooking, select the desired bake mode and adjust the clock if the delay exceeds one hour. Program the oven to start at 350°F with the food placed on the correct rack(s). Press "UPPER" and "BAKE" to confirm, then set the cooking duration. Finally, press "START."

Again, ensure you consume cooked items quickly to prevent food safety issues.

**Keep Warm Feature**

To maintain warmth, activate the "KEEP WARM" function, set to 170°F (77°C), which keeps food warm for up to several hours after cooking. This feature can be used post-cooking along with any other baking operations. If the "WARM" setting is activated manually, it automatically turns off after several hours.

**Safety Precautions Regarding Grease**

Avoid excessive heat exposure or leaving grease-covered items unattended in the oven. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; instead, turn off the heat and smother the flames. Use a fire extinguisher if necessary. 

**Sabbath Feature**

For use during Jewish Sabbath holidays, the oven can be set to bake without manual intervention. Once activated, the oven stays on continuously for up to 12 hours, accommodating specific religious practices.

**Cleaning with the Self-Clean Feature**

Ensure the oven has cooled before cleaning. Wear protective gear and avoid using any chemical cleaners. The self-clean feature uses high temperatures to burn off residue. Remove any food remnants prior to activation. Do not place non-oven-safe items inside during this cycle. Ensure only appropriate items are within the oven during the self-clean process.

### Self-Clean Cycle Instructions

**Initiating the Self-Clean Cycle:**
To start the self-cleaning process, allow the oven to cool. This typically takes about one hour. The self-cleaning can run for approximately 2 to 3 hours, depending on the level of cleaning needed (light, medium, or heavy). Do not attempt to force open the oven door during the cycle, as it will be locked for safety. 

**Panel Indicators:**
When the self-cleaning cycle is active, the "DOOR" and "LOCKED" indicators will flash, and the selected duration will be displayed. If "REMOVE RACKS" appears, ensure that all racks are taken out before proceeding.

**Completion of the Process:**
Once the cycle is finished, you will hear three beeps, and the door will remain locked until the oven has cooled. Check that the "UPPER," "DOOR," and "LOCKED" indicators are displayed. Wait until the oven cools down before attempting to restart the self-clean. 

### General Cleaning Guidelines

**Regular Maintenance:**
To prevent the need for extensive cleaning, remove spills and heavy soiling immediately. Regular cleaning minimizes the effort required for major cleanings later.

**Cleaning Recommendations:**
For painted or chrome surfaces, use a soft cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as they can damage the finish. If sticky residues persist, use a damp cloth with cleaner, but never apply cleaners directly to the heating elements.

### Care for Stainless Steel

**Enhancing Appearance:**
For stainless steel, follow specific cleaning guidelines to maintain its appearance. To remove or replace the oven door, refer to hinge care instructions to avoid scratching.

### Troubleshooting

- **Oven Doesn't Operate:** Ensure the power supply is connected. If the oven doesn't work, check if a circuit breaker has tripped or if a fuse has blown.
  
- **Light Malfunctions:** If the oven light is not functioning, it may be burned out and needs replacing.

- **Self-Clean Issues:** If the self-cleaning cycle fails, ensure the door is properly closed. Excessive smoke during broiling can indicate too much grease; reposition items to allow for proper airflow.
