### Specifications for Counter-Depth Refrigerator E23CS78ESS

The E23CS78ESS Counter-Depth Refrigerator has the following built-in dimensions appropriate for installation: 70-1/4" in height, 36" in width, and 24" in depth. When measuring for installation, the height should be taken from the finished floor to the soffit or overhead molding. A water line and outlet connection are recommended for optimal performance.

If the optional accessory (ECK23CDS) is utilized, the dimensions adjust to approximately 70-1/4" in height, 36-1/8" in width, and 24-1/2" in depth, allowing for adequate clearance with overhead structures. Overhead clearance requirements must be observed to ensure proper installation.

Manufactured in the USA, this unit features a fingerprint- and smudge-resistant coating. The PureAdvantage technology provides cleaner and fresher air circulation, complemented by thoughtful lighting transitions that enhance food visibility. The Smooth-Glide shelves facilitate easy access to food items, which can be adjusted in height for optimal storage.
