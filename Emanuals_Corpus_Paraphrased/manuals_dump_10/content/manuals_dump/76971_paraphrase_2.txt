**Camera Operation Overview**

The camera has several modes, including White Balance adjustment ([MANUAL]) and Edge Graphics settings. The device supports Memory States for operations such as turning the camera ON/OFF and switching between Color/B&W. When powered off, memory settings are retained. 

To access wireless memory functions, press [PRESET] for factory settings or [CALL] for previously saved configurations. The SD card can be managed via the OSD using controls on the front panel or a wireless remote. To hide or display the menu, use the [HIDE MENU] button. 

To insert or remove the SD card, perform the action gently, ensuring that the device is powered off to avoid damage. The SD card should be compatible with memory sizes of 256MB or 512MB, supporting formats like SXGA, HD 720P, and XGA.

For SD card operations, pressing [MENU/ENTER] will open the respective OSD menu where options like CAPTURE and SLIDE SHOW can be selected. Be mindful of write protection settings that may inhibit read/write functionality. 

If the SD card is removed unexpectedly, the display will indicate “NO CARD.” To clear or format the SD card, navigate through the OSD options accordingly. Data transfer to and from the PC via USB is supported for compatible operating systems such as Microsoft Windows (SP2, SP4).
