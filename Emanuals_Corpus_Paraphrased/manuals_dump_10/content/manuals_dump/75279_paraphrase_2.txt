**Cooking Instructions Summary:**

1. **Preheating**: Always preheat the oven to the specified temperature before cooking meats and other dishes. This ensures optimal cooking results.

2. **Cooking Method**: For items such as trout, use a strainer to manage dripping and enhance even cooking. Coating meats with a layer (like honey) can improve flavor and richness.

3. **Dishes and Utensils**: Use high-rimmed Tirolean dishes with caution, particularly for items like gratins and baked cakes, to prevent overflow. 

4. **Cooking Adjustments**: Monitor browning levels and adjust heat accordingly. If the top or bottom is browning unevenly, reduce the temperature or reposition the dish in the oven.

5. **Avoid Overcrowding**: Ensure there's enough space between food items for proper heat circulation, which affects cooking times and results.

6. **Post-Cooking**: After cooking, let items rest as indicated to enhance flavor and texture.

7. **Specific Baking Goods**: Different pastries and doughs (like shortcrust, meringues, or choux) require careful handling and specific instructions for the best outcome.

8. **Compact Steam Information**: Refer to specific models for details on steam cooking, particularly with the EBC SL7/70 series, to attain precise results. 

9. **Warnings**: Ensure items are not too high in the oven, which can lead to improper cooking or burning.
