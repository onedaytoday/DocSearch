#### Important Notes
Ensure the oven light is operational; it indicates that the oven is heating correctly. The shelves should be positioned straight against the back to provide stability. When cooking batches like Yorkshire puddings, place food centrally with space to facilitate even heat distribution and easy cleanup. 

### Ventitherm Fan Cooking

This system circulates heat for more efficient cooking. Always preheat to achieve the desired temperature as the recommended settings may not apply if unheated. 

#### Batch Baking
Ventitherm is advantageous for batch cooking. Follow temperature guidelines closely, adjusting as necessary for different recipes.

### Conventional Cooking

### Hints and Tips for Cooking

When preparing food, it is essential to position it within the appliance to allow for adequate air circulation, particularly when cooking at high temperatures. For optimal results, monitor the cooking process and adjust the positioning of the food as necessary. The following temperature guidelines are recommended for cooking various items, such as rashers, chops, and whole fish like trout or mackerel, typically at temperatures ranging from 140°C to 220°C. 

#### Fan-Controlled Defrosting

Utilizing the fan-controlled defrosting function allows foods, particularly delicate items like cakes and cheesecakes covered in frosting, to thaw evenly without applying heat. Factors such as the cooling efficiency and ambient temperature influence the defrosting process. For faster defrosting, ensure meats are cut thinly to expedite the process, which usually takes several hours. After defrosting, it is important to cook the food immediately to prevent bacterial growth.

### Care and Cleaning

Before cleaning, always allow the cooling fan to fully ventilate the appliance. Avoid using bleach or harsh chemicals on any surfaces to maintain their finish. To clean external surfaces, use a suitable cloth; for stubborn stains, a mild cleaning product may be used gently.

#### Internal Maintenance

For internal cleaning, adhere to the specific cleaning instructions for different oven surfaces. Remove any screws securing components before cleaning, and ensure all parts are securely reattached post-cleaning.
