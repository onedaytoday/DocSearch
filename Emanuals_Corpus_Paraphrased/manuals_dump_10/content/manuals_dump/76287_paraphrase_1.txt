Thank you for choosing our washer.

### DELAY START Feature

To set the delay start for your machine, you can choose a time frame of up to a specified number of hours. Once selected, the time will display for a few seconds before reverting to the main interface. If the SOAK option is used, the corresponding time will also be displayed. You can utilize the START/PAUSE button to confirm your selection. As the program progresses, the lights will indicate the current phase.

### Sorting Guidelines

When preparing laundry, follow these sorting guidelines: separate whites, colored items, synthetics, towels, and tablecloths. Avoid washing whites and coloreds together to maintain brightness; new colored items should be washed separately at least once. Use appropriate treatments for stubborn stains, such as pre-soaking or using specific detergents designed for those fabrics.

### Washing Instructions

For effective cleaning, follow recommended washing temperatures, avoiding overcrowding the drum. If prewash is selected, ensure to add the right amount of detergent without exceeding the MAX level. The water supply temperature and amount should also be monitored based on garment care labels.

### Operating the Machine

Use the ON/OFF switch to power on your machine and select settings by pressing the corresponding buttons. Each function’s light will indicate its selection, such as SPIN SPEED or NIGHT CYCLE. You may also choose options like PREWASH or SUPER RINSE as needed.

### Maintenance Checklist

Regularly inspect your machine, particularly seals, hoses, and filters, ensuring that they are clean and functioning properly. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for cleaning and maintenance to prolong the machine's lifespan.

### Troubleshooting Issues

If you encounter error codes such as E10, E20, or E40 during operation, refer to the troubleshooting guide for potential causes and solutions. Issues might arise from door closures, hose connections, or incorrect settings. Follow the steps to resolve these issues without needing a technician unless specified.
