The cooling system consists of coolers operating within a temperature range of -2/+8°C, featuring various thicknesses and either built-in or modular designs. These units are pre-charged and constructed with advanced assembly techniques, ensuring ease of installation. Modern injection methods enhance performance and thermal efficiency, utilizing high-grade pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free of CFCs and HCFCs. Rounded internal corners facilitate better airflow, while a fast-fit design allows for straightforward assembly, achieving an airtight seal with PVC materials.

The coolers operate efficiently under high ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) and are compatible with refrigerants like R404A. They include an automatic defrosting system that utilizes heated defrosting elements to minimize downtime, while also integrating internal lighting rated at IP54. Standard features include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat. The doors are right-hinged and designed with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges that ensure an airtight seal, contributing to improved energy efficiency while complying with HACCP standards.
