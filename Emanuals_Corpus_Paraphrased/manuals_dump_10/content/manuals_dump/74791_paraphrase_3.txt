The FROSTMATIC function is indicated by a yellow light, which activates to preserve the freshness of food. If manually turned off, the light will stop illuminating. Over time, frost may accumulate in the appliance, and it is important to monitor its thickness. When it becomes too thick, adjustments to the thermostat may be necessary to prevent excessive frost buildup. To defrost, follow specific guidelines: remove food, switch off the appliance, and clean the interior. 

Be cautious when defrosting, as the indicator light may flash and produce sounds when the process is complete. Ensure that the appliance is disconnected from power for safe cleaning, avoiding any risk of electric shock.

Additionally, when storing food, it is advisable to use airtight containers or wrapping to maintain freshness. Regular cleaning of the appliance is essential for optimal performance. In case of any malfunctions, refer to the operating manual for troubleshooting, or contact service support for assistance.

For any repairs, the appliance should be turned off, and any service requests can be directed to the appropriate service provider listed online. The COOLMATIC function operates at a setting of +15°C to ensure effective cooling without ice formation, providing a suitable environment for food storage.
