### Paraphrased Text

**Cooling Foods:** Allow food to cool before storing. Ensure that warm items do not contribute to the formation of frost. For optimal results with the FROSTMATIC function, either set it to operate for several hours or adjust it according to the recommended settings. The FROSTMATIC lights will indicate the operation status.

**Food Storage:** Store foods in airtight containers to avoid contamination and preserve quality. Be aware that using the FROSTMATIC function continuously will eventually turn off automatically. The yellow indicator light will inform you when it is active.

**Defrosting and Ice Cubes:** When making ice cubes or defrosting, monitor the time closely to prevent frost buildup. If frost accumulates, refer to the cleaning and defrosting sections for guidance on removing it. A layer of frost should ideally be defrosted at least once to maintain appliance efficiency.

**Warnings:** Exercise caution when heating or using mechanical methods during the defrosting process. Following the operating instructions is crucial to ensure safety and prevent health hazards, especially concerning plastics.

**Cleaning the Appliance:** To clean, switch off the FROSTMATIC function and unplug the unit. Use a cloth to clean the interior surfaces, and ensure proper collection of any condensed water. Regular cleaning is essential for optimal performance and to avoid electrical shock hazards.

**Malfunction Troubleshooting:** If issues arise, consult the manual for corrective actions. Repairs should only be conducted by qualified service personnel. If the appliance is not cooling or if the light is malfunctioning, check for power supply issues. Always unplug the appliance before performing any checks or repairs.
