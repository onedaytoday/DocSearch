### Cooking and Food Preparation Instructions

When cooking, the oven uses heat to continuously warm the food, which facilitates the cooking process. This heat is maintained at specific temperatures (e.g., 350°F) to ensure proper cooking of various foods, including breads and reductions. When cooking, ensure the food is evenly surrounded by heat by using racks or other accessories.

To begin cooking, press "BAKE." The oven will display the set temperature, confirm it with a sound when it's reached, and heat will rotate within the cooking chamber. For favorite settings, the oven can be programmed to recall previous cooking parameters, which will be indicated by flashing prompts on the display.

**Operating Notes:**
- The oven can be used with Sabbath mode while complying with Jewish laws.
- The clock will override cooking parameters if incorrectly set. Ensure the correct temperature (between 170°F and 550°F) is chosen.
- Timed Bake or Delayed Timed Bake functions are available for flexibility.
- The light can also be manually toggled on or off, depending on your cooking needs.

### Self-Cleaning Feature

The Self-Cleaning function operates at high temperatures to eliminate food residue, reducing it to ash. It is crucial to follow safety guidelines, such as ensuring children are kept away during the cleaning cycle. The interior, including walls and racks, should remain free of cleaners or protective coatings that might be damaged during high-temperature cleaning.

When initiating the self-cleaning cycle, the door will lock automatically for safety. Once the cycle is complete and the oven has cooled down, the door will unlock, enabling further use. For different cleaning intensities, settings like SPEED CLEAN and MAXX CLEAN permit customization.

**Important Safety Considerations:**
- Use appropriate cleaning cloths and avoid scouring pads that can scratch surfaces.
- Always refer to the provided cleaning instructions, particularly for painted or delicate surfaces.
- Self-Cleaning use is limited to select cycles to prevent damage and ensure safety.

For further details on cleaning and maintenance, please consult the respective sections outlined in the manual.

**Important Precautions:** Do not allow spills, food, cleaning agents, or any other materials to enter the gas orifice holder opening. Always check the head and surrounding areas during cleaning.

**Safety Protocols:** Wear leather gloves for protection while cleaning. Use a screwdriver to safely navigate any heavy components during the cleaning process.

**Light Instructions:** The light is manually operated and will turn on when in the correct position. If the shield needs to be removed, press to release it, and then turn it back to its original position once done.

**Clock and Service Information:** Refer to the clock section for setup instructions. This includes workmanship details and listed corrections for installations that may be too tight. Ensure the appliance supply is properly turned on and check for clogs.
