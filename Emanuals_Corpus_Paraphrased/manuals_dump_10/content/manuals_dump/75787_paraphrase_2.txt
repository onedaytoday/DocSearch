**Fresh Food Storage and Temperature Guidelines**

Maintain fresh food storage within the specified temperature ranges of -15°C to -24°C, ensuring an internal temperature of -18°C for optimal preservation. Caution: Recent tests reveal that when the temperature rises to 5°C during defrosting, the operating system may prioritize immediate cooking or rapid cooling. This is indicated by flashing lights and sounds that signal reaching the highest temperature, at which point “E” will appear on the display.

For commercial and fresh foods, the recommended storage duration depends on the quantity, which should influence the cooling or defrosting process. To enhance freshness, be prepared to adjust the settings as necessary. User interaction includes pressing a button to confirm the food choice. Acoustic alerts will indicate the process status, with various sounds denoting different stages of operation.

When defrosting, pay attention to the positioning of items: ensure products are not blocking airflow. Remove ice or frost build-ups, as they can obstruct performance. Prioritize the following storage practices:
- Avoid overcrowding, which can inhibit cooling efficiency.
- Ensure that food is wrapped properly to minimize freezer burn and maintain quality.

To clean the appliance, disconnect it from the electrical supply, and use non-abrasive cleaning solutions. Regular maintenance is necessary for optimal operation.

**Troubleshooting and Service Information**

If issues arise, such as excessive frost build-up or persistent operating sounds, verify that items are stored correctly and that nothing is obstructing airflow. For persistent problems, please contact the Service Force for assistance and warranty services, relevant to your region. Refer to the specific warranty guidelines, which cover mechanical faults or defects in workmanship.

Keep in mind the product ratings for energy efficiency and ensure proper ventilation around the unit to promote effective cooling. Additionally, follow any manufacturer instructions regarding cleaning and maintenance for longevity.
