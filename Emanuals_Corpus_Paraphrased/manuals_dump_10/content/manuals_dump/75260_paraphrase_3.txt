# Adjusting the Main Oven Shelves
To position the main oven shelves, ensure they are straight with the back aligned correctly. Each shelf should be placed in a way that allows easy access from the front, and any wires should be properly arranged. 

### Tips and Recommendations
- When using the oven, switch it on in advance.
- Count the shelves starting from the top.
- For optimal cooking, center the shelves instead of placing food too close to the front or back. This promotes even heat distribution.
- For items like cakes, position them centrally. 

# Conventional Cooking in the Main Oven
This method allows you to cook without any specific operation settings. It is especially suitable for dishes like gratins that require top browning.

### Using Conventional Cooking
Activate the desired cooking function and confirm your choice. Set the temperature to 200°C. Ensure the oven has reached the target temperature before cooking. To deactivate the function, press it once again.

### Important Notes
- The interior light will activate once the desired temperature is attained.
- If necessary, the heat function may be employed for shorter cooking times.

# Cooking Hints and Tips
- To enhance cooking, adjust the shelf height.
- Leave space around the food for better heat circulation.
- Utilizing the proper cookware can improve browning and overall results.

# Main Oven Cooking Chart
Follow temperature adjustments closely, using increments of 10°C as necessary. Specific instructions should be adhered to for various items, including pastries.

# Roasting Guidelines
The roasting chart should be referenced for optimal cooking times and internal temperature targets for different meats.

# Pizza Cooking Instructions
Certain foods, like pizzas, require a specific approach. 

### Using the Pizza Setting
Activate the cooking function, then set the temperature to 190°C. Ensure the oven reaches this temperature before starting to cook.

### Important Cooking Tips
Center the food for even cooking, and if necessary, adjust the shelf position to suit thicker dishes for optimal results.

This function is suitable for slowly cooking meat to retain its tenderness. 

### Using Low Temperature Cooking
Sear the meat first over high heat and then switch to the low setting, choosing a temperature between 120°C and 150°C.

# Fan Roasting
Fan roasting provides a cooking environment that is typically associated with conventional roasting but allows the oven door to remain closed.

### Using Fan Roasting
Activate the function and set the oven to 200°C. Ensure proper positioning of food within the oven.

# Main Oven Grill Procedures
Exercise caution while using the grill, especially around children.

### Using the Main Oven Grill

### DEFROST

This function allows you to defrost food without applying heat directly to it, utilizing ambient conditions instead. It’s ideal for items like cheesecakes or foods with frosting.

**Using Defrost:**
To activate, switch to the Defrost function or press the corresponding button. Once you’ve set your parameters, the selected function will begin after a few seconds. To turn off, simply press the function button again. The process typically operates at around 30°C.

**Important Notes:**
Ensure the interior lighting is functioning. The cooling system will affect the defrosting process, particularly for items that are thicker or more densely packed. Larger cuts or thicker chops may require several hours to defrost completely. Always cook defrosted food immediately to prevent bacterial growth, and avoid refreezing items that have already been thawed.

### FAST HEAT 

The Fast Heat function accelerates preheating by rapidly raising the cavity temperature to the desired level.

**Using Fast Heat:**
Select the Fast Heat option in conjunction with your chosen cooking function. An indicator will flash as it heats. Once the target temperature is reached, you will hear a confirmation sound.

**Important Notes:**
The Fast Heat function will assist in achieving the temperature necessary for your selected cooking method.
