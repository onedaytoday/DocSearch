Recessed fountains require a supply of unplated water, as needed. Ensure a thorough connection to the cooler and the building’s water supply, using a shut-off valve for the unplated system. Remember to remove any burrs from the tubes before installation. **IMPORTANT**: Do not solder tubes that are inserted into the strainer, as this could damage the O-rings. 

Grounding is essential for equipment such as computers to prevent feedback that can lead to electrolysis, which might affect the cooler's operation. The system should be electrically isolated from the building to ensure reliable functioning. Allow clearance for steady operation.

For installation, maintain factory settings at 50°F and clean with appropriate cleaners and protectants. Lubricate the water cooler’s moving parts using lead-free options.

To connect using quick-connect fittings, simply push the tube into the fitting and secure it by pushing in the collet. To release the tube, press it in before pulling it out.
