To maintain optimal combustion flow and prevent blockages, ensure the burners are cleaned from any heavy residue. Allow the grates to cool before cleaning them thoroughly. After cooking, clean the cooking surface immediately with a cloth. If the unit has cooled down, clean any residue following the manufacturer's guidelines. Accumulated grease can affect both safety and appearance, so regular cleaning is essential.

**Troubleshooting**: Inspect the unit at least once or as soon as any issues arise, particularly if flames appear yellow. Ensure that the high heat function operates correctly; the indicator light should activate when the control is pressed. If the heat setting does not respond appropriately, check and possibly replace the battery. For units using LP gas, ensure that the supply is clear; preheat as directed.

**Insect Warning**: Keep an eye out for insects that may obstruct the burner flow. Regular maintenance is necessary to prevent potential fire hazards and ensure the unit operates effectively.

**Warranty Information**: This is a limited warranty that covers specific instructions for proper use and maintenance, as outlined in the warranty documentation.
