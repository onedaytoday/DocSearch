**Cleaning Procedures**  
When cleaning the appliance, ensure that any scouring agents or cleaning solutions used are compatible with the materials. As a precaution against frost, if the temperature is expected to drop below freezing, turn off and disconnect the appliance. Ensure it is empty before performing any cleaning tasks.

**Troubleshooting Guide**  
If you hear whistling noises during operation, this may indicate an issue with the electrical charge flow or improper connections. Verify that the household appliance is switched on and that the selector is set correctly. All parts, including inlet and outlet hoses, should be securely attached. If there is water leakage, inspect the outlet hose for blockages or excessive bends, which could restrict flow. Follow the provided instructions for correct setup. 

**Connections and Hose Maintenance**  
Ensure that the hose is properly secured and does not have any obstructions that could affect the suction. The selected program should match the load requirements, and if a rinse or soak option is chosen, terminate this process when needed. Check for any excessive outlet height that may affect performance.

When emptying the appliance, ensure the water supply is disconnected and the unit has cooled down. To avoid spills, release the emptying hose carefully and allow water to drain completely. When reattaching, ensure the hose is secured tightly in a clockwise direction.
