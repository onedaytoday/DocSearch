### Tape Recording Instructions

This device enables direct recording from a CD or via the built-in microphone. 

**Playing Compact Discs**: To switch to CD mode, press the function button. 

**Listening to the Radio**: To record using the built-in microphone, ensure the tape function is selected (RADIO OFF). Press the STOP/EJECT button to begin the process. Use only appropriate tape types, such as CrO (Chrome) or C-60, ensuring they are ready for recording. 

**Recording Process**: To record sounds from the microphone, ensure itâ€™s active. Press PAUSE to temporarily halt recording. Once finished, press STOP/EJECT to finalize the session. The Automatic Level Control (ALC) feature prevents distortion during recording.

**Headphone Connection**: The stereo headphone jack accepts standard headphones, which can prevent audio feedback when connected. When headphones are plugged in, the internal speaker will be disabled, thus enhancing sound quality.

### Care and Maintenance of Cassette Tapes

To prevent accidental overwriting, ensure the record tab on the cassette is intact. If recording functionality needs to be restored, a screw can be removed to re-enable the record tab. 

**Cassette Care**: Proper handling minimizes playback issues. Ensure the tape is aligned correctly to avoid tangling. Avoid exposing tapes to extreme conditions, like sunlight.

### Head Cleaning

Tapes should be cleaned regularly to maintain performance. Switch the device off and use cleaning cloths or head cleaners to clean the recording heads gently.

To maintain your CDs, use lint-free cloths to gently wipe the surface, cleaning in straight lines from the center outward. Avoid using abrasive materials.

### Cabinet Care

Clean the exterior with soft cloths or appropriate cleaners. Be cautious not to allow cleaning agents to damage the device.

### Troubleshooting Guide
