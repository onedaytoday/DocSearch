### FAST CHILL/FAST FREEZE Functions

**FAST CHILL**
The FAST CHILL feature quickly cools items and is ideal for parties. To activate FAST CHILL, press the recessed button until "IC" appears on the display. This function automatically adjusts the temperature to +2°C. It operates for several hours, and at the end of this period, the unit returns to its original temperature setting. You can also deactivate FAST CHILL manually.

**FAST FREEZE**
The FAST FREEZE feature rapidly freezes fresh food to preserve its quality. To initiate this function, press the recessed button on the FAST CHILL/-FREEZE control until the yellow light activates. The FAST FREEZE function will run for a specified duration based on the quantity of food being frozen. You can turn it off manually using the same button.

Both functions are designed with child-proof features. Hold the ON/OFF button for several seconds to switch the appliance off or to switch to standby mode. The countdown timer will indicate when the appliance has switched off.

**Stand-by Mode**
Stand-by reduces the temperature to +15°C to prevent spoilage, mold, or odorous buildup when the appliance door is accidentally closed. To set stand-by, turn the knob counterclockwise until the temperature reaches +10°C. The temperature can be adjusted further to +15°C as needed.

**Warnings and Indicators**
The system provides audible and visual warnings if temperatures exceed set limits or if thawing occurs. If the temperature rises above 5°C, the warning light flashes, and an alarm sounds. This alarm will cease when the temperature comes back into the acceptable range. 

**Thawing Alerts**
If food is at risk of thawing, a warning will flash. If the temperature falls below -4°C, the warning will turn off. In the case of a technical malfunction, both a visual and acoustic alert will indicate the service needed, with specific error codes (F1 through F7).

**Temperature Management**
Management of food temperature is vital for safety and quality. Use a thermometer to monitor temperatures, especially overnight. For best practices in food storage, it’s advised to keep foods below -18°C. 

**Storage Guidelines**
For optimal food preservation, utilize protective wraps and ensure proper organization within the shelves. Place taller items at the back and shorter ones in front for easier access. Bottles should be stored horizontally, ensuring that the neck protrudes from the shelf edges.

**Defrosting**
Regular defrosting is necessary when frost accumulates. Turn off the unit, and let it defrost completely when frost reaches a considerable thickness. Follow proper procedures to avoid damage to plastics or food safety hazards.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**
Disconnect the appliance from electricity before cleaning. Use a non-abrasive cleaner and ensure it’s free from bleach. Regularly clean the interior and allow it to maintain optimal performance. Inspect the light for any replacements needed and ensure that switches are handled cautiously to avoid electric shock. 

For any issues, please consult the service manual or contact customer support for assistance with malfunction indicators.

### Note on Frost and Normal Operation Sounds

In the event of frost, the AEG Service Force may need to be contacted regarding any charges or breakdowns. Should you experience issues with the airtightness of the unit while using the heater, please note that this system is designed to regulate temperature effectively.

**Technical Overview**

The cooling process, also referred to as thermoregulation, allows warmth from food or other items to be effectively managed. Heat transfer occurs within closed systems, facilitating the dissipation of excess warmth. The heater is built-in and installed at the rear of the unit. Standard operating procedures dictate that heat is released into the environment, adhering to regulations outlined for household appliances, including GSG, VBG, and VDE standards.
