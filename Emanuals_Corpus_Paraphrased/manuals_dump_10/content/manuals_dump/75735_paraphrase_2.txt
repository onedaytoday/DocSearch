### Technical Summary

**Chilling Process:**
The system rapidly reduces the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C in under four hours, effectively decreasing bacterial levels. It continues to cool food further to -18°C. This chilling and freezing process allows for long-term storage of food without compromising quality, offering an efficient solution for food preservation.

**Operating Modes:**
The unit features various chilling modes, including Soft Chilling (to +2°C) and Shock Chilling (to +3°C or -18°C). Continuous cooling is maintained by the ARTE system. The integrated controls include built-in UV sanitization, as well as defrosting capabilities. The interface provides countdowns and service information, with temperature limits set at up to +32°C. Upon reaching specific thresholds, the unit can temporarily hold at -14°C before transitioning to a deeper freeze at -36°C to -40°C while actively monitoring HACCP compliance. The system logs operational data, which is critical for safety and quality assurance.

**Performance Metrics:**
The chilling system efficiently transitions food from +90°C to +3°C within four hours, with configurations available to accommodate different food types and capacities.

**Construction Details:**
The unit is constructed from AISI stainless steel with high-density polyurethane insulation, fully HCFC-free, and environmentally friendly.

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Productivity:** Complies with NF Regulations for chilling in the UK.
- **Thermostatic Controls:** Equipped with built-in thermometers and adjustable GN configurations.
- **Included Accessories:** Features a 3-sensor probe for chilling and freezing applications, single sensor probes, HACCP compatibility, and additional support racks.

**Installation and Maintenance:**
The equipment includes a range of installation requirements, including plumbing options. It is certified under NF Hygiene Alimentaire by AFAQ AFNOR for cleaning and thermal performance.

**Conformity and Safety Standards:**
Meets all relevant ISO standards with an emphasis on safety, cleaning efficiency, and operational protection classified under IP20.
