**Warning: PM Black Drying Protocols**

**Drying Cycles for Various Fabrics**: Ensure that loads consist only of either synthetics or non-synthetic materials. Connect the hose securely and switch the ON/OFF control accordingly. If the DRYING TIME light is illuminated, press START/PAUSE. To reset the system, turn the ON/OFF switch off, then back on.

**Sorting Laundry**: Separate items by type—tablecloths, towels, and aprons should be sorted based on their fabric properties. Avoid mixing heavy items with lightweight ones, as this may cause uneven drying. Coloured pieces should be washed with similar colours; whites can also be washed together but prioritize separation to prevent discoloration.

**Use of Cleaning Products**: Opt for non-biological detergents for whites and delicate items. Use bleach cautiously and ensure it's suitable for fabrics. Follow product instructions carefully to maintain the integrity of your clothing.

**Washing Temperatures**: Adjust settings based on fabric requirements. Standard guidelines include:
- Synthetics: 30°C
- Cotton: 40-95°C depending on the level of soiling

**Fabric Conditioners**: Incorporate fabric softeners to reduce static and improve softness. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal results.

**Cleaning the Appliance**: Regular maintenance is essential. Disconnect from power before cleaning. Ensure the filter and hoses are clear of debris and check for any blockages. Follow instructions for specific cleaning procedures.

**Error Codes**: Be aware of error codes (e.g., E10, E20, E40) that may indicate issues such as drainage problems or incorrect loading. If these codes appear, follow the specified troubleshooting steps or consult Service Force.

**Customer Support**: For further assistance or details on service options, contact Service Force or visit their website for more comprehensive information.
