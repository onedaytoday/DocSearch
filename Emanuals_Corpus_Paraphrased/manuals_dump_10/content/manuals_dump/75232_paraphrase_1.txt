The Rothitherm system allows for preheating of food to optimal shelf conditions, utilizing functions such as cooking, roasting, and ensuring heat resistance for various meat types. Adhere strictly to the specified instructions to avoid burning during the roasting process. When using the Rothitherm roasting function, the thickness of the meat and clear guidelines regarding quantity are crucial to achieving desired results. Preheat the unit before placing the food on the recommended shelf.

Utilizing the defrosting function effectively requires covering items with a plate, as this can significantly reduce defrosting time. For defrosting specific items like meat, trout, or whipped cream, ensure thorough turning for even results.

The drying function, designed for fan-assisted drying, requires that food items be spread out without touching. Adjust the temperature according to the specific food type, such as beans, mushrooms, apricots, or apples.

When it comes to cleaning, ensure that the unit is turned off and cool before beginning. Avoid using abrasive materials that could damage surfaces. Use a damp cloth for exterior cleaning, and proceed with caution when handling lightbulb replacements or any components.

Repairs and maintenance should only be performed by authorized service professionals. In the event of operational issues, consult the troubleshooting section or customer service.

For recycling and disposal, follow local regulations. Ensure that the appliance is disconnected from power supplies before servicing. The guarantee and customer service information can be located on the back of the user manual provided by the manufacturer.
