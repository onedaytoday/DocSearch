**EX-72F-UK English: NEW BASE_English Microwave Operation Overview**

**Microwave Functionality**  
Microwave plates can overheat, potentially leading to fire hazards. To prevent this, avoid using newspaper or recycled materials in the microwave. When operating the microwave, attention should be paid to the specific functions selected for cooking or reheating various foods, including meat and baked goods like cakes. This operation allows for cooking at a lower temperature, facilitating even heating compared to conventional methods.

For functions that involve grilling or browning, select the microwave/grill cooking mode appropriate for the dish being prepared—either microwave or grill mode. The TIMER/WEIGHT/POWER dial should be adjusted accordingly, and the START/+30 button pressed once the setting is complete. 

**Dual Grill Functionality**  
Utilize DUAL GRILL functionality for specific cooking tasks as needed, ensuring the proper mode is selected before starting. To cook gratinated dishes, you can access the AUTO COOK PLUS GRILL option.
