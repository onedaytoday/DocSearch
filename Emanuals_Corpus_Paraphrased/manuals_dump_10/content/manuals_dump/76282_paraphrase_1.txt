Integrate the AM Black unit by ensuring it is securely mounted at the specified height. Fix the unit using the four countersunk screws at the front, which allows for proper alignment. The mounting should maintain clearance at the top, ensuring that the height and width measurements (W, H) are respected. This setup provides additional stability and security for the installation.
