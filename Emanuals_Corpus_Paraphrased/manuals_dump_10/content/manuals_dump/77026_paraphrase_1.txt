### Installation MAN-TUBIG Guidance

**Connecting the M1, M2, M3, and Protective Earth (PE)**  
To connect the system to the M1, M2, M3, and PE, it is crucial to ensure proper phase establishment. It is recommended to use shielded twisted pair cables for enhanced immunity. When setting up, the grounding of the shield should be linked to the chassis, ensuring that the PE is adequately grounded.

**Connecting AC Power Supply**  
The AC supply should be connected to the AC1, AC2, and AC3 terminals, along with connecting the Protective Earth to the PE. For immunity, using shielded cables is mandatory. Four wires will connect to the AC terminals; the fourth will connect to the protective earth.

**Connecting DC Power Supply**  
Ensure proper creation of DC connections. Disconnect all power sources before establishing connections. This will aid in preventing heat generation during setup. Proper organization of connections is critical for effective operation of the TUB00020B system.

**Connecting Auxiliary 24VDC Supply**  
The 24VDC auxiliary supply requires image shielded cables for effective coverage. Shielded cables should use reinforced insulation to prevent interference and ensure safety when connecting to ground. Verify the connection's polarity with Function +24VDC and RET24VDC correctly labeled.

**Setting Up Feedback Systems**  
The feedback systems are designed to provide intuitive usage. It's suggested to connect feedback via AWG twisted-pair shielded cables tightly to the housing of the D-type connectors. Ground the shield effectively to the chassis and follow proper assembly instructions concerning the shielding.

**Feedback A Configuration**  
For Feedback A, ensure suitable feedback connections to the system. When working with interpolated options, follow outlined instructions for assembling Feedback and Tachometer configurations. Adjustments should be made according to the respective functions within the software.

**Feedback Assignments Table**  
Refer to the provided Feedback Assignments chart to ascertain correct wiring and connections for feedback inputs and outputs. Each component should be connected based on designated functions outlined in the technical documentation.

**Combining Feedback Systems**  
Integrate Feedback B systems while ensuring that the logic and commands from Microprocessor (MCU) properly interpret positions from both Feedback A and B. The software must accommodate various settings for effective operation.

**Feedback Options**  
Select between various feedback options based on the application needs, such as Follower or ECAM configurations. Adjust input values according to specified high auxiliary settings and ensure power connections are robust.

**I/O Configuration**  
The connection setup involves three types of I/O: Analog Inputs, Digital Inputs, and Digital Outputs. Each input should be configured according to the guidelines provided for optimal functionality. 

For complete configuration guidance, refer to the respective section within the installation manual.
