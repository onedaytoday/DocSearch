**Sorting Laundry**: Follow the guidelines for sorting your laundry: separate whites, colored fabrics, and synthetics. Items such as towels, tablecloths, and blouses should be sorted as follows: white items with similar colors should be washed together, while new colored items may release dye and should be washed separately at first. Treat stubborn stains as necessary using recommended products and methods. Ensure not to overload the machine to avoid compromising washing efficiency.
