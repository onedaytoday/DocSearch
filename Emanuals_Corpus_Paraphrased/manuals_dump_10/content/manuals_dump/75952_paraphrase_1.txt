**Warning and Information System**

The system provides acoustic warnings related to temperature issues. If the temperature rises above a certain threshold, an alarm will sound, and the warning light will flash, indicating that food may be at risk. To silence the alarm, press the "ALARM OFF" button; the light and tone will deactivate automatically once the appliance reaches the appropriate cooling temperature.

The shelves are designed to maintain optimal conditions for food preservation. It is crucial to arrange items properly, placing heavier or taller items at the back, and keeping the front accessible for lighter items. To maximize cooling efficiency, position bottles horizontally. The Chill Shelf is optimal for storing beverages.

**Cooling Specifications**

The standard temperature for optimal food preservation is around 0°C, although it can be slightly higher depending on the arrangement. Use a thermometer to periodically check the temperature of the lowest shelf. This can help ensure that items like meat and dairy are stored correctly. It is advisable to let the appliance stabilize overnight after closing before taking readings. 

**Normal Operating Sounds**

When operating correctly, the appliance will emit background noises, such as a gentle whirring from the cooling system. Ensure that food is stored with adequate spacing to allow for proper air circulation, and avoid placing hot items near the unit, as this can hinder performance.

**Defrosting and Cleaning**

To maintain efficiency, clean the unit regularly, disconnecting it from the power supply first. Use non-corrosive cleaning agents and avoid harsh chemicals like bleach, which can damage the interior and protective elements. Regular cleaning helps maintain performance and prevent the buildup of frost.

**Maintenance and Service**

Annual maintenance is recommended, which can be arranged through Service Force. Should you need replacement parts or repair services, only use authorized technicians. Always refer to the appliance's manual for proper usage and service guidelines.

**Regulatory Compliance**

The appliance meets all relevant safety and efficiency regulations as outlined by EU directives. It is designed to operate effectively while minimizing heat transfer, thereby maximizing cooling efficiency.
