**Installation and Service:**
- Securely connect the unit to the electrical service, ensuring it is properly grounded and compliant with the latest national electrical codes.
- For installations in cold climates, consider thermal efficiency of ductwork. 

**Included Components:**
The assembly should contain a blower, grease filters, ducting template, screws, anchors, and optional charcoal filters. Typical installation height should be noted, and any duct transitions should minimize bends to optimize airflow.

**Final Checks:**
Before completing the installation, ensure all lines are perfectly perpendicular and that all screws and anchors are firmly secured.

**Screw Location and Template Instructions:**

Ensure proper alignment with the indicated screw positions on the template. Pay attention to the top mounting point of the cleats. **IMPORTANT:** The mounting locations for the screws are represented in the diagram below. Follow the template closely when determining the correct positions for the screws. 

Install the screws by hand, ensuring they align with the designated screw heads. Pay attention to the lower screw positions as well. When connecting the ductwork, refer to the illustrated instructions for an airtight fit, securing it with the assembly screws as depicted.

**Warning:** Always turn off the AC service when required. **Electrical Grounding Instructions:** The appliance has an electrical junction box with wires, one of which (green/yellow) is for grounding. To prevent electric shock, connect the green/yellow wire to your home's grounding wire. This wire must not be cut or removed. 

For installation, ensure the cover is mounted securely using the provided assembly screws. The compatibility of wires (white and green/yellow) should meet National or CSA standards.

**Mounting the Cover:**

Secure the cover at the top using the assembly screws. Ensure that it is installed correctly to maintain functionality.

**Blower and Light Functions:**

To operate the light, press the ON button. If already ON, press OFF. Functionality can be adjusted with the appropriate buttons, initiating a countdown for any actions. If not activated within a certain period, the countdown will reset. 

For adjustments, use the respective buttons to increase or decrease the light intensity. The clock feature can be set using specific buttons to track hours and seconds effectively.

**Maintenance Instructions:**

Regularly clean the grease filters according to the frequency specified. If the appliance is used frequently, clean the filters monthly. The filters can be washed or placed in the dishwasher. 

**For Optional Charcoal Filters:**

If applicable, replace or clean the charcoal filters every few months as indicated in the instructions provided. Do not wash them in the dishwasher.

Use appropriate cleaning products for the surfaces, ensuring that harsh chemicals are avoided. For cleaning, employ soft cloths or towels and approved household cleaners. Regular maintenance will prolong the effectiveness of the unit.
