**9094-21/EN Reference: Washer FOM CLS, FOM IEC**

**Introduction**
The FOM CLS Software facilitates inspections related to laboratory references and cleaning protocols, with guidance for monthly maintenance. This document serves as a reference for users regarding the IEC standards affecting the FOM CLS and flow installation processes.

**FOM CLS Overview**
The software updates include adjustments for initial filling conditions, temperature modifications, and speed calibrations across low and high ranges. Backlight improvements have also been implemented alongside corrections to the software through tests with IEC protocols and service downloads.

**Inspection Protocols**
During the FOM CLS inspection, several criteria should be addressed:
- Verify clearances to ensure compliance with standards.
- Ensure proper connections of hoses that allow unrestricted flow to the reference.
- Hoses must be constructed from PVC or an equivalent material to meet specifications.

It’s essential to maintain a supply of the necessary amounts to meet operational requirements, ensuring efficient heating while observing the reference parameters.

**Assembly and Calibration**
Assemble components according to provided guidelines, ensuring that the system is calibrated correctly. Unit operations, including service and program selections, are typically performed manually or via interface interaction.

**Calibration Instructions**
When performing level calibration, users should follow these steps:
1. Fill water to reach the desired level.
2. Confirm calibration, keeping in mind that old settings will be overwritten upon confirmation.

Make sure the system is powered correctly, and that all hoses are free from obstruction to maintain optimal performance. 

**Operational Guidelines**
The performance and configuration of FOM CLS are critical, and any adjustments to hoses or connections should comply with the specified criteria. Ensure all operational balances are checked and that hose weights conform to installation requirements.

**Debugging and Settings Adjustments**
In the event of discrepancies in temperature readings or system performance, technicians should refer to specific functions and settings tables to adjust parameters accordingly. This includes modifying operational timings, temperature settings, and speed control functionalities.

Maintain a record of adjustments made for transparency and future reference. Ensure that all service and calibration reports are completed and saved within the system for documentation.

**Note:** The adjustments and settings should only be implemented by authorized personnel to guarantee compliance and proper functioning of the washer.

### Conclusion
The provided technical overview details operational functions, error management, maintenance, and inspection processes necessary for optimal functionality and adherence to standards, ensuring efficient operation of the system as per the established requirements.

The FOM (Field Operation Manual) pertains to the laboratory and its associated equipment. The guidelines below detail the operational procedures for the heating BSP within the laboratory. 

Authorized laboratory personnel should refer to the FOM and the CLS (Control System) for details on the internal software and system operations. If the heating temperature is excessively high or low, the heating element must be replaced. Adjustments may be necessary to manage incoming flow rates. The procedures can be found in Chapter Flow.

For ELS (Equipment Load System), the FOM details the flow configuration as a straight front layout. The housing position where the FOM flow is attached is specified, along with the K-factor, which relates to the supply and installation conditions. If needed, flow adjustments should adhere to the outlined procedure.

Procedure B outlines steps for laboratories experiencing flow discrepancies. The procedure involves selecting specified temperatures, inspecting flow against reference values, and recalibrating as needed to achieve the correct K-factor values.

Regular maintenance is critical. The FOM includes cleaning directions to prevent buildup that can affect performance, including impurities that might clog heating elements. 

Additionally, the instructions detail how to clean the hoses and ensure unobstructed flow, including disassembling parts when necessary to remove debris.

Motor-operated systems should be regularly checked to ensure proper function, with self-clearing mechanisms in place for optimal operation.

Weekly and monthly maintenance is required per IEC standards, ensuring that all components function correctly. Regular inspections help prevent significant performance issues.

In summary, the FOM outlines comprehensive operational, maintenance, and cleaning procedures essential for effective laboratory function and compliance with IEC specifications.
