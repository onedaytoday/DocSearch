To maintain the integrity of stored foods, it is best to organize items in the refrigerator by placing bottles upright in an appropriate manner. For optimal storage, items should be stored on the lowest shelf to keep them cooler, as higher shelves tend to become warmer. All foods should be properly sealed or packaged to prevent cross-contamination and maintain freshness. It's recommended to use airtight containers, wraps, or covers to protect food.

Ensure that items reach a temperature of around 18°C before storing; allow cooked food to cool appropriately before placing it in the fridge. Using the FROSTMATIC function can accelerate cooling and keep foods fresh. Be aware that the FROSTMATIC feature has a preset timer and will automatically turn off after a certain period. If needed, you can manually activate or deactivate the function, ensuring your desired settings are re-engaged.

When preparing food, particularly ice cubes, ensure they are defrosted properly. The section on "Cleaning and Defrosting" provides guidance on removing frost buildup. It is crucial to follow safety protocols during the defrosting process to avoid potential hazards linked to improper handling and to maintain food safety.

Regular cleaning of the appliance is necessary to avoid electrical issues; always disconnect power before performing maintenance. Use appropriate cleaning supplies and take care not to use harsh chemicals that could contaminate food.

For addressing malfunctions, consult the specific sections for troubleshooting tips. If any lights indicate issues, check the relevant sections on light indicators and cooling functions to rectify problems with the appliance effectively.

This appliance complies with relevant household safety standards and regulations, ensuring safe operation while properly managing food temperature and storage.
