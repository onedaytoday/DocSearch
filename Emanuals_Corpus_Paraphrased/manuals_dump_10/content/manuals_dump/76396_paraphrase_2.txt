To quickly select options, use the "SUPER QUICK" feature to minimize drying time. The "EXTRA RINSE" function is available to help those who require additional rinsing. When this option is activated, a light will indicate its selection. If the countdown timer is interrupted, the light will flash accordingly. If an incorrect option is chosen, a yellow light will illuminate for a few seconds.

To enable the "DELAY START," select the appropriate option, specifying the desired hours for the delay. Keep monitoring the timer until the light indicates the final selection. If you wish to pause the process, press the designated button. The system locks the door during operation, and if there is an emergency shutoff, the door will automatically unlock.

At the end of the drying cycle, the acoustic signal will sound, and a light will indicate the cycle's completion. To turn off the unit after the cycle, switch the power button. Ensure the unit is empty before initiating a new cycle to avoid issues.

For drying various fabrics, select the appropriate drying setting based on the type of material you're using—laundry may consist of synthetic fabrics, cotton, etc. Ensure the items are arranged properly to avoid creasing, particularly during the "ANTI-CREASE" phase. 

Common wash programs include "Reduced White" for heavily soiled items, "MIX" for both whites and coloreds, as well as cycles tailored for delicate garments. Always adhere to temperature guidelines; for example, whites may be washed at 40°C or 60°C. 

For tips on sorting laundry, separate whites, colors, and synthetics, and follow specific care instructions. Using stain removers and bleach appropriately will enhance cleaning results.

Please note: when selecting drying cycles, make sure to match them with the fabric types to avoid damage and maintain performance. Always read the user manual for additional guidance on settings and fabric care.

**Garment Care and Maintenance Instructions**

Light-colored garments such as these may become charged when drying is completed, which can cause static buildup or fire hazards. To prevent this, ensure proper wash settings are selected, including any necessary pre-wash cycles. Follow drying instructions and the maximum load capacity guidelines in the relevant drying chapter. 

Maintain and clean the appliance by disconnecting it from the electrical supply before servicing. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent buildup during usage. The top of the chamber and other components should be cleaned with non-abrasive cleaning agents. 

Should the appliance need to be emptied, turn the cover clockwise to remove it securely. Be cautious while cleaning and servicing by ensuring all components are turned off and properly secured. If the water temperature is below 0°C, proceed with specific measures for the emptying hose to avoid damage.

In case of any operational issues indicated by warning lights or sounds, consult the service guidelines. The hose should be checked for clogs, and if necessary, cleaned thoroughly to ensure proper flow. Ensure all connections are tight to facilitate efficient performance.

For installation, connect the water supply hose as directed, ensuring no obstacles impede the pathway. Use the appropriate spacers when securing the hose, and ensure it is positioned correctly, particularly in environments susceptible to freezing temperatures.

Assess environmental concerns by recycling any materials as per local regulations. For further information or service inquiries, visit the manufacturer's website or the service center.
