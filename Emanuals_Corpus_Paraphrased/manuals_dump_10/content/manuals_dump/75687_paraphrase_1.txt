### Chillers Overview 

Chillers are designed to reduce the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, minimizing bacterial growth. They efficiently chill food, ensuring it stays below +3°C and is held safely without compromising quality. The chilling process is enhanced by a built-in system that offers comprehensive performance capabilities.

#### Operating Modes

The chiller features various operating modes, including Soft Chilling (2°C) and Standard Chilling (12°C). The system continuously monitors the cooling process from the time food is inserted. Advanced models include features such as built-in UV lights and defrosting options. The control panel provides a countdown and essential service information, recording operational data for compliance with HACCP standards, especially when abnormal terminations occur.

#### Performance Specifications

The performance metrics of the chiller depend on features relevant to its specific type as defined by NF regulations relating to chilling in the UK.

#### Construction and Design

The chiller is constructed with AISI-grade stainless steel and features a high-density polyurethane insulation layer that is HCFC-free. The design adheres to ISO standards with rounded corners and is rated for IP20 protection.
