The LW GN tradition emphasizes research into creativity and professional operations, offering flexible cooking and chilling options tailored for various needs. The GN operating modes include convection cooking, which allows for meat to be prepared without gratin, utilizing a half-power function that reduces cooking time and weight. Steam cooking further enhances this process while preserving food quality.

The system integrates automatic phases for cooking and holding, managing various food items, including baked goods, with optimal precision. It allows for efficient free cooking by adjusting to precise temperature settings. The built-in cooling and cleaning features streamline the cooking process, adhering to HACCP standards for recording and maintaining food safety.

Specifications include options for LPG supply, as well as a variety of technical data regarding dimensions, cooking chamber height, and weight. The unit's construction includes high-efficiency heating elements and a thermo-glazed cooking height for safety and maintenance. It is accessible from the front, with IPX5 protection against water.

Accessories available for the GN cooking system include GN1/1 grids for whole chickens, frying baskets, aluminum baking trays, banquet racks, and automatic water softeners. Additional items include exhaust hoods, heat shields, and various conversion kits for gas types. Non-stick U-pans in several heights, rack support systems, and optional software for program management further enhance functionality, making this a comprehensive solution for culinary operations.
