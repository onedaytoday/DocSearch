### Lighting Instructions for Grill Burners

**Before Lighting**  
Ensure the grill is set up correctly. To ignite the **Grill Burner**, locate the igniter positioned properly. When ready, turn the control knob counterclockwise to the **HIGH** setting, and listen for the ignition sound. Allow up to a few seconds for it to light. If it does not ignite, turn the knob off and wait before attempting to relight.

**Match Lighting**  
In case the igniter fails, lighting with a match is an alternative. Position the match at the right location, keeping it near the burner while turning the control knob to **HIGH**. If the burner does not light after several attempts, refer to the troubleshooting section.

**Control Knob Layout**  
Turning the control knob to the **HIGH** position aligns the indicator arrow appropriately. For **LOW**, ensure the arrow points downward.

**Grill Location and Clearance**  
Ensure adequate clearance around the grill, particularly at the rear and below the cooking area. This facilitates proper ventilation and reduces fire hazards.

**Cooking Notes**  
Use the **back burner** for effective heat distribution when cooking, utilizing direct heat for searing. Monitor cooking speeds to ensure food reaches the desired doneness without overcooking.

**Rotisserie Setup**  
To attach the rotisserie, align it so that it faces the back of the grill. Securely position the meat for consistent cooking. Ensure the electrical connections are sound and utilize a grounded outlet for safety.

**Lighting the Rotisserie**  
For ignition, turn the control to **HIGH** and ensure you hear the ignition sound. If lighting fails, utilize the match lighting method.

**Drip Tray and Grate Maintenance**  
The drip tray should be emptied and cleaned regularly to prevent grease buildup. Cooking grates must also be cleaned promptly after use to maintain hygiene and performance.

**Troubleshooting**  
Inspect the grill annually for potential issues. If you notice yellow flames or uneven heating, check for blockages. Insect infestations in gas lines can also affect performance; clean regularly to avoid this.

**Warranty Information**  
Products are covered under a limited one-year warranty, with a lifetime warranty on stainless steel burners and panels. Keep all service receipts for warranty claims. Unauthorized repairs may void the warranty.

### Safety Precautions  
Always observe safety measures to prevent hazards while operating and maintaining the grill. Make sure to disconnect gas supplies when troubleshooting or servicing.
