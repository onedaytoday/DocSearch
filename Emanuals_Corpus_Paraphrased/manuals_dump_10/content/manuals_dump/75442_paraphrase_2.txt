**Cooking and Oven Safety Guidelines**

When using the oven to cook food items, it is essential to ensure that children are kept away from the lower oven while it is hot to prevent burns. Avoid using foil to line the oven drawer or to cover oven racks, as this can interfere with the cooking process and pose a safety hazard.

Ensure that food is cooked to the appropriate height and follow the guidelines for using recommended cookware. If there is a fire, turn off the oven immediately and use a fire extinguisher if needed. It's crucial to monitor the food being cooked to avoid undercooking, which can lead to foodborne illnesses.

The following cooking options are set at various temperatures such as 350°F (176°C), 170°F (76°C), and up to 450°F (232°C). To utilize these settings, press the LOWER OVEN button, then select BAKE and START. The display will indicate preheating, and once the oven reaches the designated temperature, it will notify you.

Be cautious, as food should not be left at inappropriate temperatures for extended periods to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Certain temperature settings must be maintained to ensure food safety, with specific guidelines for different food items.

**User Preferences and Clock Settings**

To personalize the appliance, users can adjust preferences through the USER PREF menu. This includes setting the clock format (12-hour or 24-hour), temperature units (Fahrenheit or Celsius), and sound notifications for cooking functions.

**Self-Cleaning Features**

The self-cleaning function enables high-temperature cleaning that effectively eliminates residues. Avoid using harsh cleaners or protective coatings during this process. Ensure racks are removed prior to self-cleaning, and be aware that the cavity will become extremely hot.

Use the following steps for self-cleaning: press the UPPER OVEN button, select CLEAN, choose MED or HEAVY, and press START. After the cycle, allow sufficient cooling time before opening the oven door.

**Cleaning Instructions**

For cleaning, utilize appropriate cloths and cleaners specific to the surface material, avoiding abrasive materials that can cause scratching. Ensure all surfaces are cool before initiating cleaning processes, following guidelines for specific materials such as painted or chrome surfaces.
