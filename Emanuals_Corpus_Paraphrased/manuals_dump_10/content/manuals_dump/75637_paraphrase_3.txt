### SANTO KA Upright Instructions

Dear Customer,

Please refer to these operating instructions for important information regarding the usage and functionality of your appliance. The instructions include crucial warnings and supplementary information to assist you in operating it safely. For explanations of any technical terms used, refer to the "Technical Terminology" section.

### General Safety and Operation

For any malfunctions, please consult the section "Troubleshooting." In the event that these instructions are unclear, contact AEG Service Force or the Customer Service line at your location.

**Appliance Specifications and Location:**
The appliance should be placed in a location that avoids direct sunlight and heat sources. Ensure proper ventilation as specified in the installation guidelines to avoid excessive frosting. Keep clearances as indicated, particularly at the top.

### Electrical Requirements

**WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED.** Before connecting the appliance, ensure the electrical supply matches the specified ratings. The wiring color codes must align with the following connections: 
- Yellow/green wire to Earth (E)
- Blue wire to Neutral (N)
- Brown wire to Live (L)

### Initial Setup

When setting up the appliance, please ensure it is in an upright position for at least a few hours before turning it on. This allows for optimal operation.

**Powering On/Off:**
Use the ON/OFF switch to operate the appliance. The indicator light will illuminate when powered on. Adjust the temperature setting using a coin to turn the dial. 

### Food Storage Recommendations

Organize food items according to their required temperatures, with meats stored on lower shelves. Ensure that all items are appropriately covered to prevent contamination and maintain freshness.

### Defrosting

Regularly check for frost buildup, which should be defrosted when necessary. Frost will thaw and collect in the base, evaporating over time.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Before cleaning, always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply. Use appropriate cleaning products and ensure that all surfaces are wiped down thoroughly. Avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage the appliance.

**Warning: Electrical shock can occur.** Always ensure the appliance is turned off at the electricity supply before proceeding with cleaning.

For further assistance or if you have any questions, please contact AEG Service Force or your nearest customer support center.

If a service request is generated, it may indicate that the appliance is not operating correctly due to excessive temperature or continuous frost presence. Common symptoms include household lights dimming or flickering while the appliance is in operation. Ensure that the appliance is properly sealed and fitted, especially the food compartment and light switch, which should be airtight to maintain heat. If you experience issues with water management, contact AEG Service Force immediately. Faulty mechanical components or malfunctions may occur; thus, please reach out to AEG for service related to these symptoms.

Technical Factors: Cooling issues may arise from improper food placement or obstruction within the appliance, affecting heat dissipation. Heat generated inside the appliance is typically expelled into the surroundings. The appliance is often built-in and positioned at the back, influencing its cooling efficiency.

Compliance: AEG adheres to household safety standards and European regulations (like GSG, VBG, VDE) as stated in EU directives 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG (including 92/31/EWG).

Warranty Conditions: AEG offers a warranty for the first buyer covering defects in material or workmanship, valid for the specified period from the date of purchase. This warranty does not cover damage from unauthorized repairs or misused components. Should any damage occur, the buyer must notify AEG or an authorized service provider. All repairs made under warranty remain the property of AEG.

If the appliance is moved to another country, be mindful of compliance with local regulations, as the warranty may apply differently based on the region.
