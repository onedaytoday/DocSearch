### Grill Pan and Handles

To ensure optimal use of the grill, position the food centrally on the grill plate, which is specifically designed for this purpose. When cooking, make sure to place the food on an appropriate shelf to achieve desired cooking results. **Suggestions:** Adjust the cooking shelf based on the thickness of the food and maintain appropriate distance for even cooking. Always preheat the grill for meats or other foods requiring a high temperature. 

### Second Oven

The secondary oven allows for versatile cooking, suitable for cakes and other dishes. Use the second oven’s lowest and top shelves efficiently. **Note:** The oven light indicates when it is on or off, maintaining appropriate temperatures during cooking. Ensure that the shelves are straight and properly positioned for effective airflow.

### Telescopic Runners

For models equipped with telescopic runners, position the shelf securely in the back, ensuring it is aligned correctly at the front. **Advice:** When utilizing the shelves, consider positioning versatility for optimal heat distribution across a variety of dishes. Increase the cooking time if needed based on the type of cookware used.

### Conventional Cooking

This method allows for versatile cooking without additional functions. **Tip:** Adjust heat distribution to enhance cooking quality. Positioning food appropriately can improve browning, especially for specific dishes such as Yorkshire pudding.

Feel free to ask if you need more technical specifications or further assistance!

## Hints and Tips for Cooking

Food should be arranged in such a way that there’s a high level of airflow around it, particularly during cooking. Ensure the selected temperature is within the range of 140°C to 220°C for optimal results. It's advisable to turn food as needed during the cooking process. Refer to the ROTITHERM Roasting Chart for specific shelf placement and cooking times for various foods, such as rashers and whole fish.

### Fan Controlled Defrosting

This function is designed for defrosting foods at low temperatures without applying heat. It's ideal for delicate items like cakes with icing or cheesecakes. Note that proper air circulation during defrosting is crucial, and keeping foods at a cooler temperature aids the process. Defrost meat thoroughly and cook immediately after, as lingering in the cooling phase can promote bacterial growth.

**Before Cleaning:** Always allow the cooling fan to completely cool the appliance before turning off the electricity supply.

**Exterior Cleaning:** Use appropriate cleaners that are free from bleach to avoid damaging finishes. Use a soft cloth, and quickly wipe off any spills.
