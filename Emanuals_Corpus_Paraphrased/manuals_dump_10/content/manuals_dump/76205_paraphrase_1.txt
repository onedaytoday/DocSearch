The Wall-Mount RH30WC55GS is a high-quality, aesthetically pleasing appliance designed for easy cleaning. It operates with a powerful blower (CFM rating not specified) that effectively illuminates the cooking area with lights integrated into the design. The appliance features an easy-to-use LCD clock, stainless steel construction, and sound lights for operational feedback. 

It is compatible with ducting options, allowing for installation with direct or round duct systems, and requires a 120V electrical service with a grounded connection. 

Important installation specifications include the correct height above the cooking surface, which should not exceed recommended limits. For homes in colder climates, proper ducting must be utilized to maintain optimal performance. 

The wall-mount hood is designed for compatibility with various Electrolux appliances, including built-in microwaves and dishwashers. Additionally, it can be converted to a ductless option using optional charcoal filters (EICFW60GS) if required.
