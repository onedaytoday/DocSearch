**NOTICE:** This cooler is linked to the supply coupling. **IMPORTANT! ATTENTION INSTALLER:** Proper grounding for devices such as telephones and computers is essential. Grounding prevents feedback that can lead to electrolysis and increased wear on the system. Refer to the following details:

**LEGEND:**
- O.D. TUBE WATER OUTLET
- C TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENT
- O.D. TUBE WATER INLET
- ELECTRICAL
- O.D. TUBE WATER INLET TO CHILLER

**NOTE:** Ensure proper water flow direction according to the instructions for HCR8-1J. 

**INSTALLATION:** Connect the unplated copper tube to the cold water supply from the building. A service stop is not included. For HCR8-1J installation, maintain adequate clearance from the cooler's mounting cavity, particularly above and below. The O.D. tube should be connected to a thoroughly flushed water supply before operating the cooler. If flushing is necessary, the strainer should be cleaned to ensure effective operation.

This cooler must be connected directly to the specified water supply with appropriate shut-off valves and phased correctly. 

**START-UP:** Ensure steady operation and maintain necessary clearances for troubleshooting. 

**MAINTENANCE:** Factory settings suggest a 50Â°F adjustment by turning the screw clockwise. Clean the unit with a hose or appropriate cleaner, and lubricate the protector as needed. 

**OPERATION OF QUICK CONNECT FITTINGS:** 
- To secure the tube, simply push it in until the collet is engaged.
- To detach, push the tube in before pulling it out to assist in releasing.
