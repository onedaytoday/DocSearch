### Installation Instructions for Ductwork and Operation Guidelines

#### Ductwork Assembly
As illustrated, connect the ductwork ensuring all components are airtight. Secure the assembly using screws as shown in the diagram. Ensure that duct seams are aligned correctly. To uninstall, carefully remove the assembly screws. Attach the outlet to the assembly using the indicated screws.

#### Blower and Lighting Operation
To control the blower and lighting functionality, press the ON button to activate the light if it was previously off. To turn it off, press the OFF button if it was on. The system initiates a countdown timer and operates within predetermined intervals. If action is not taken within those intervals, the system will revert to previous settings.

The system also features sound notifications and visual indicators based on user interactions. For example, pressing specific buttons adjusts settings such as speed or sound levels.

#### Clock Functionality
The clock can be set using the designated buttons. It displays hours and seconds, with a visual indicator to denote active status. The user can round settings or reset the clock using simple button combinations.

#### Grease and Charcoal Filter Maintenance
The grease filter requires regular cleaning and should be washed monthly, either by hand or in a dishwasher. The system will alert you when the filters need attention. Charcoal filters have a limited lifespan and must be replaced as indicated. 

For optimal performance, ensure the surrounding environment does not exceed 70°C and clean the blower frequently to reduce grease buildup.

To maintain efficiency, keep the area surrounding the appliance clean and free from obstructions. Use compatible cleaning products suitable for the specific materials, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the finish.
