**Ice Cube Preparation and Defrosting**

To prepare ice cubes, ensure the tray is filled and positioned correctly. The ice tray should periodically defrost automatically, which can cause frost to accumulate inside the appliance. If frost builds up excessively, food may not remain properly chilled. It is recommended to regularly check the thickness of frost and perform maintenance as needed. 

For defrosting, remove food items and set the thermostat to a warmer setting. This will facilitate the melting of frost and help maintain food quality. Make sure to clean the appliance regularly, as a buildup of frost inside can hamper performance. Before cleaning, turn off the power supply to avoid electric shock, and use non-corrosive cleaning agents.

**Maintenance Procedures**

Prior to any cleaning, ensure that the appliance is disconnected from the power source. Clean the interior surfaces with a damp cloth and appropriate cleaning solutions. To access internal components, remove the cover using a screwdriver as needed.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**

In case of issues, consult the troubleshooting section. Common symptoms include the appliance not cooling properly or food freezing. Adjust the thermostat settings appropriately and inspect for any electrical faults or obstructions. 

If the appliance lights indicate a malfunction, investigate possible water leaks or contact the service team for assistance. For any repairs or inquiries about the product, contact Service Force or consult the website for support.
