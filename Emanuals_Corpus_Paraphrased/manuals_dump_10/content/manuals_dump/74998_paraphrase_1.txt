Here's the technical paraphrase of your provided text:

The heating element should be engaged when the unit is closed, allowing it to switch to the GRILL function. It's essential for foods to be arranged according to thickness and type to ensure even cooking. Items such as meats should be thoroughly cooked and coated lightly with oil or butter when toasting for optimal crispness. Preheating is crucial, especially for high-heat settings. Adjust the shelf position as needed based on the food's requirements. 

Note: Monitor the thermostat to prevent overheating. The cooking time and temperature can significantly affect the meat’s texture and doneness. Ensure suitable heatproof dishes are used, as their thickness and material conductivity influence cooking efficiency. Materials like earthenware or colored heavy dishes can enhance browning, while thinner and lighter options may reduce it.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding operation settings and cleaning. For effective roasting, utilize heatproof pans as specified. Ensure that if items come into contact with towels or sheets, they are removed before cooking. For safety, wear protective gear during maintenance.

To clean, turn off the unit and allow it to cool completely. Disconnect from the power supply and use appropriate cleaners—avoid bleach and harsh chemicals that can damage finishes. Use recommended cleaning products to maintain surface integrity and avoid scratching. 

For bulb replacement, ensure the unit is switched off, then turn the bulb counterclockwise to remove it, and replace with an appropriate specification (25W 300C Thread E14). Always reconnect to the power supply afterward.

If cooking issues arise, check the selected function, temperature, and the state of the power supply to diagnose the problem effectively. For recurring issues or technical support, please contact Service Force or visit their website for further assistance.
