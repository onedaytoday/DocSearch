The EIMGD60L SS and EIMGD60J IW IQ-Touch models, featuring the Perfect Steam option, are designed to enhance the drying process of garments. The Perfect Steam technology effectively eliminates wrinkles and refreshes clothes. These models have a capacity that aligns with the Department of Energy (D.O.E.) standards. 

Additional features include NSF certification, versatile drying settings for different fabric types, and an end-of-cycle chime. There are also optional accessories available, like pedestal units (PN EPWD15SS for Stainless Steel and PN EPWD15IW for Island White) and a stacking kit (PN STACKIT4X) for space-efficient installation. 

For electrical requirements, the appliances need a 120V supply and should be grounded with a three-prong outlet as per National (ANSI/NFPA) codes. Installation must allow for adequate clearance from surfaces and appliances. Product specifications may vary based on fabric type and preferences as noted in the user instructions. 

Please consult the installation guide for details on requirements for length and positioning of water supply hoses, ensuring proper drainage and venting. The manufacturer reserves the right to update products without prior notice.
