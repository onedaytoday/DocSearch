### Software Selection and Features

To begin adjusting the settings, select the desired software, either by navigating through available options or by choosing the currently active setting. If the selected text is visible, it can be modified directly. You may also proceed without making a selection. 

**Preheating Functionality**

During preheating, the system will indicate its current status. The Luxury Lighting feature provides theater-style illumination, adjustable in brightness, affecting both the front and rear lights, which are activated whenever the oven is in use.

**Control Lock Feature**

The Control Lock feature ensures safety by preventing accidental adjustments. Once activated, it can be disengaged by holding down the CONTROL LOCK button for a few seconds. 

**Safe Handling of Cookware**

Use caution when handling cookware, as it can become extremely hot and may cause burns. Always ensure that items are completely cooled before removal. 

When adjusting racks or inserting cookware, it's essential to use oven mitts to prevent injury from hot surfaces. The height of the racks is adjustable to allow for optimal cooking space, ensuring even heat distribution around the food.

**Cooking Preferences and BTUs**

Choose the right type of cookware, as it can directly impact heat distribution and cooking efficiency. Keep the ventilation area clear to facilitate optimal heat flow. Ignoring this precaution may affect cooking performance.

**Preheat Settings and Cooking Features**

Preheating options are available for various temperatures, including 350°F (176°C), 170°F (77°C), and 550°F (288°C). To start preheating quickly, select the UPPER OVEN option, then press BAKE, RAPID PREHEAT, and START. The display will indicate when the oven is preheating. 

**Convection Cooking Guidelines**

Convection cooking optimizes cooking by distributing heat more evenly. When using this feature, it’s important to follow specific guidelines for optimal results. Adjust cooking times accordingly. 

**Fire Safety Precautions**

In the event of a fire, maintain safety by avoiding water on grease fires. Instead, utilize an appropriate fire extinguisher or cover with a lid. Always stay vigilant and monitor cooking to prevent grease accumulation.

*For additional instructions on handling specific types of food and cooking times, refer to the provided performance charts or guidelines.*

The convection option enables cooking various foods using the CONV BAKE feature, optimizing performance. This function allows for precise cooking of food items, ensuring they reach the appropriate temperature and are heated evenly. To initiate, press UPPER OVEN, then CONV BAKE, followed by COOK OPTIONS, and select CONV CONVERT. After selecting START, the display will indicate PRE-HEATING until it reaches 350°F (176°C) and then progresses to cooking. You have the option to cancel the cooking process at any time.

For convection roasting, ensure that food items are properly positioned on the roasting rack to allow for optimal heat circulation. This method enhances cooking efficiency and minimizes the risk of over-browning. Certain guidelines apply; preheating to 350°F (176°C) is generally recommended. For effective cooking results, consult the provided roasting charts.

When using the internal probe feature for precise cooking, it's important to monitor the internal temperature of meats. The following temperature checkpoints are critical for doneness: 170°F (76°C) for poultry and 130°F (54°C) for certain cuts. To use the probe, select UPPER OVEN, then CONV ROAST, followed by COOK OPTIONS, and select PROBE.

For slow cooking, ensure food is completely thawed before cooking to prevent risks associated with foodborne pathogens. Similar principles apply for cooking temperatures, with guidelines suggesting proper thawing protocols as per USDA guidelines.

For proofing bread, maintain specific conditions to support yeast activity. Coverage should allow warmth and moisture circulation while avoiding direct heat, with recommended temperatures between 85°F (30°C) and 100°F (38°C). 

Lastly, the MY FAVORITE feature stores frequently used cooking instructions for quick access. You can overwrite existing favorites by following prompts to select new cooking parameters.

Each function allows for adaptable cooking settings, facilitating everything from baking to roasting and slow cooking.

### Technical Summary of Oven Features

#### Sabbath/Holiday Mode
This mode disables heating functions, specifically the baking and cooking features. To start, select the bake option and set the cook time using the appropriate controls displayed. The default cook time is set at the factory to specific hours for Sabbath observance. When the lights indicating the Sabbath mode are activated, they will turn off once the cooking is initiated. It's advisable to start with pre-set time options, ensuring they do not exceed 170°F or 550°F.

#### Safety Precautions
Always keep children away from the lower oven while it's hot to prevent burns. Avoid lining the oven drawer and racks with foil, as this can obstruct proper airflow and cooking processes. If a fire occurs, utilize a fire extinguisher and turn the oven off immediately.

#### Cooking Temperatures
Follow the recommended temperature settings for various food items, including:

| Food Item         | Heating Temp (°F) | Cook Temp (°F) |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Soups (Cream)     | 170                | 170             |

#### Self-Cleaning Function
The self-cleaning feature reduces residue using high temperatures. Pertinent precautions apply: remove all racks before initiating self-cleaning, and avoid using harsh cleaners inside the oven cavity. It's critical to allow adequate cooling time once the self-cleaning cycle ends, as the oven will be extremely hot.

To activate self-cleaning:
- Press "CLEAN" for selected durations (lite, medium, heavy).
- Monitor the safety lock indicator to ensure the door is secure during the cleaning process.

These outlined features aim to enhance cooking efficiency and safety while preserving food quality.

**Cleaning Guidelines for Painted and Chrome Surfaces**

This section offers instructions for cleaning painted and chrome surfaces. Use a soft cloth for cleaning, avoiding any abrasive materials that may scratch the surfaces. To tackle built-up grease, apply cleaners directly to the cloth rather than the surface to prevent damage.

For effective cleaning, turn off the appliance and let it cool before beginning. Follow the recommended procedures for cleaning both the top and front surfaces thoroughly. Prompt cleaning is crucial for maintaining the integrity of painted and sealed areas. 

Ensure that you do not allow food residue or cleaning agents to accumulate, as this can lead to complications. Use a damp cloth to remove grease and residue, especially in recessed areas. Heavy cleaning may be necessary, and you should always follow the specific product instructions to avoid scratching.

**Important Cleaning Tips**

When cleaning heating elements, ensure they are turned off and cooled down to prevent burns. Always follow the safety instructions provided with the appliance and use the appropriate tools, like a screwdriver for removing parts if needed.

For certain types of cleaners, ensure they are compatible with your appliance; using the wrong kind can lead to damage or increased wear. 

If the appliance displays error codes such as F10, F11, or others, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact customer support at 1-877-4ELECTROLUX.

**General Maintenance Advice**

Regular maintenance is essential for proper functioning. Remember to clear any built-up grease and follow clearing instructions carefully.  If there are any concerns about the appliance’s performance, consult the service guide or call authorized service representatives for assistance. 

For safety, always wear protective gear when cleaning, and follow all manufacturer instructions regarding the cleaning procedure and materials.
