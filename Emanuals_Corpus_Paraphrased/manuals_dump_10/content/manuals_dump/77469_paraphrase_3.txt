### Tape Recording Instructions

This feature allows you to record directly from a CD, while also enabling playback of compact discs and radio. To begin, press the designated button and align the cassette with the facing end. Please avoid using CrO (chrome) formulations or C-60 tapes, as they are not suitable for this device. Prepare the cassette for recording by ensuring it meets the requirements.

To initiate recording, press the record button. This device also includes Automatic Level Control (ALC) for managing the recording levels. You can adjust the recording volume to optimize sound quality.

### Headphone Connection

The stereo headphone jack (PHONES) is located at the back and allows for connection of headphones, which can be included. Using headphones will lower the overall volume, which can be adjusted from the device. 

### Care and Maintenance of Cassette Tapes

Ensure proper handling of recorded tapes. If the tab is broken off, it prevents recording on that side. Always remove the casing from the tape when re-recording. 

To prevent issues during playback—such as tangling around the mechanism—keep an eye on tape tightness and alignment. Avoid exposing tapes to direct sunlight or moisture.

### Head Cleaning

Regularly clean the tape heads to maintain playback quality. Use a soft cloth or isopropyl head cleaner. Always turn off the device before cleaning.

### Compact Disc Care

To keep discs in good condition, handle them by the edges and avoid touching the surface. Clean CDs with a lint-free cloth, moving from the center outward. Use appropriate CD cleaners if necessary.

### Cabinet Maintenance

To maintain the appearance of the cabinet, clean it with a soft cloth or suitable cleaner.

### Troubleshooting Guide

Refer to this guide for issues with sound or signal reception. If FM/AM stations are not correctly receiving broadcasts, ensure the BAND switch is set properly. If problems persist, reposition the antenna or check for any obstructions.
