Here’s a paraphrase of the provided text in a more natural and technical style:

To ensure effectiveness, keep the appliance properly closed. This supports its functionality, including temperature and humidity management essential for cooling. Allow food to reach room temperature before placing it on the shelves to prevent frost buildup. Make sure all foods are stored appropriately, maintaining their integrity within the designated shelves.

Adjust the height of the shelves as necessary. Position them in line with the appliance's rear for optimal performance. Note that certain food types, such as confectionery, ready meals, fresh meat, dairy, and seafood, should be stored with care. The refrigeration chart provides specific guidance regarding the placement and cooling of these items.

Utilize the FROSTMATIC function by pressing the appropriate buttons to set your desired food temperature. The display will show the actual and desired temperatures, and if adjustments aren’t made within a specified time, it reverts to the actual reading. Be aware that pressing the wrong button could lead to incorrect settings.

For optimal cooling, the FROSTMATIC function is highly recommended. It helps preserve the freshness of recently added items while protecting existing food supplies. Activate this feature manually if needed, and it will automatically turn off after a designated time.

When switching off the appliance, use the designated button. Be cautious when storing food; ensure that items are properly sealed to avoid bursting, especially liquids. Allow food to cool effectively and avoid overloading the appliance.

Keep in mind that the operational sounds you hear—such as whirring—are normal for the cooling system. Should you notice any unusual noises or issues, consult the user manual for troubleshooting.

For maintenance, regular cleaning is essential. Avoid harsh chemicals; use appropriate cleaning solutions for the interior and exterior. Ensure that you clean the back of the unit and any accessories every so often to maintain optimal performance.

If any issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting chart for guidance. Electrical components should be handled carefully, and if replacement is necessary, consult a qualified technician to ensure compliance with safety regulations. Always ensure that the appliance is correctly earthed and that all wiring is intact before operation to avoid any risk of electric shock.
