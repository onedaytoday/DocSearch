To store fresh food effectively, ensure the appliance maintains a temperature of 18°C or lower. The appliance's capacity rating indicates the amount of fresh food it can handle within a designated timeframe. It is crucial to avoid overloading and to allow air circulation around the food items. Proper wrapping and organization of food within the designated shelves will help maintain freshness.

When preparing food for freezing, ensure it is in appropriate portions, using airtight containers or wraps. Avoid placing hot items directly into the freezer. Ensure food is sufficiently cooled before freezing. 

For defrosting, utilize the dedicated function, keeping an eye on frost buildup. Excessive frost can indicate a problem that requires attention. Be cautious with cleaning; always switch off the appliance before maintenance to avoid electric shock. Regular cleaning is essential for proper function.

In case of malfunction, check the lights and internal functions. If issues persist, contact technical support. The appliance should operate efficiently without excessive frost. 

For customer service inquiries or repairs, please reach out to Service Force. The warranty covers defects in workmanship for a specified period post-purchase, provided that the appliance is used according to the instructions and not subjected to unauthorized repairs.
