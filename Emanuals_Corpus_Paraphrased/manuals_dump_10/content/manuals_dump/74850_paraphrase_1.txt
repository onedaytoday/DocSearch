**Lighting the Grill Supply**

Before igniting the grill, ensure the supply is properly connected. 

**Grill Burner Lighting:**

To light the grill using electronic igniters, locate the igniters on the right side. Turn the knob counterclockwise to the HIGH setting and immediately press the button. You should hear a sound indicating ignition within a few seconds. Should the burner fail to light after a few seconds, turn it off and retry.

**Match Lighting:**

Alternatively, if the igniter fails, use a match to light the grill. Position the match near the igniter, turning the knob counterclockwise to HIGH as you ignite the match.

**Control Knob Layout:**

Turning the control knob allows you to set the flame to HIGH or LOW. 

**Grill Location:**

Ensure the grill is positioned correctly, with adequate clearance from walls and overhead structures for optimal ventilation and to avoid any fire hazards. 

**General Safety Rules:**

Always test the grill according to the given instructions. Preheat the grill while monitoring for grease buildup, which can pose fire risks. 

**Heat Management:**

The grill’s back heat is suitable for searing various meats, providing intense cooking heat. 

**Rotisserie Attachment:**

To attach the rotisserie, ensure it faces the back of the grill. Once in position, secure the meat and tighten the screws.

**Igniter Access:**

If the ignitor needs maintenance, access it from the side burner shelf. Replace the battery as needed.

**Infrared Burner Usage:**

To maintain the infrared burner, it should be lit at least once a month to prevent grease accumulation.
