### Water Heater Instructions and Basic Information

**1. Overview and Preselection:**
The ELECTROLUX IH instantaneous water heater continuously heats water as it flows through. The heating can be controlled by a flowrate switch, which turns off when the flow rate is reduced below a certain threshold. This appliance allows preselection of the desired temperature, ranging from 30°C to 60°C, with specific settings for showers at 40°C and baths at 55°C.

**2. Operation:**
For optimal operation, the water heater should maintain a flowrate higher than specified (usually around 8°C above the thermostatic setting). When water temperature is below desired levels, adjustments to the flowrate may be necessary. Normal flowrates for the specified temperatures are 6°C, 10°C, and 14°C.

**3. Maintenance:**
To maintain the appliance, the exterior should be cleaned with a cloth. Additionally, regular inspection by a trained professional is recommended for ensuring the longevity of the unit and safety of operation. Any obstruction in the outlet or shower head needs these components to be cleaned to reduce flowrate.

**4. Compliance:**
The water heater is compliant with IEC and DIN standards, including EC Directives 72/23/EEC and 89/336/EEC pertaining to electrical and electromagnetic safety. 

**5. Installation Instructions:**
- Ensure the appliance is mounted wall securely and frost-free, using the included mounting template, wall plugs, and screws.
- Before installation, flush the system to clear it of any debris.
  
**6. Safety Features:**
The heater includes safety functions that prevent overheating. In case of a fault, LED indicators will signal active functional issues, prompting inspection or repair by qualified training personnel.

**7. Customer Service Information:**
For any servicing needs, please contact a certified service provider. The contact information for support and details on the appliance rating can be found in the manual.
