For installation guidance, please refer to the following information. Begin by securing the top tension assembly using screws. Ensure that the elbow and plates are correctly aligned at all four corners with the provided screws, referring to the diagram below as a guide. Proper assembly is crucial for achieving the desired tension.

The AcousticPro1080 black cloth effectively minimizes light reflection, enhancing the screen's performance. Attach each plate to the back of the AcousticPro1080, ensuring they create sufficient friction for optimal tension.

Follow these instructions carefully to ensure that the plates are attached properly. Pay close attention to the positioning of the top of the plates during installation, taking care not to obstruct any switches or outlets. Ensure that the wall is structurally sound and capable of supporting the screen's weight.

For cleaning, use a high-quality cloth; avoid harsh chemicals or direct contact with cleaners to maintain the integrity of the screen.
