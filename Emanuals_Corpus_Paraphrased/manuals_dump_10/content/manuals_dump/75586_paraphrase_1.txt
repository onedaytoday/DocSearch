The cooling system is composed of coolers operating between -2°C and +8°C, featuring various thicknesses and equipped with built-in components. This system includes an assembly with pre-charged cooling capabilities, designed with advanced injection techniques to enhance performance, utilizing high-quality pre-painted Polyurethane insulation. It is free from CFCs and HCFCs, with rounded internal corners for safety.

The fast-fit design incorporates high-quality, airtight PVC, facilitating easy installation. The system is capable of operating efficiently in high ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) using refrigerants R404A and supports both high and low temperature applications. When needing to defrost, it employs a heated method to optimize defrosting times, including internal lighting rated at IP54. 

Key features include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a functioning thermostat. The right-hinged door is engineered with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges that provide airtight sealing and superior insulation, contributing to energy efficiency according to HACCP standards.
