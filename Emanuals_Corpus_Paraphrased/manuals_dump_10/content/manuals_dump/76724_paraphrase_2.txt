### Installation Instructions for EDFP210FPC and EDFP217FPC

To ensure a smooth and accurate installation, please review these straightforward instructions before beginning. Verify that your installation adheres to all relevant plumbing, electrical, and local codes. Refer to these guidelines for fountain installation.

**Important Safety Note:** Grounding electrical equipment such as telephones and computers with water lines is standard practice, which can occur either within the building or externally. This grounding may introduce electrical feedback into the fountain, leading to electrolysis that can result in a metallic taste or elevated metal levels in the water. You can prevent this issue by using the specified materials. Ensure that any drain fittings provided by the installer are made from plastic to keep the fountain electrically isolated from the building's plumbing system.

**Service Notice:** All maintenance should be conducted by authorized personnel.

### Mounting Bolt and Access Hole Layout

For the EDFP210FP and EDFP214FP models, refer to Figure 97565C for the layout of mounting bolt locations and access holes. Ensure to position the fountain correctly, according to ANSI A117.1 and ADA guidelines. Securely tighten the fountain with the washers and screws as indicated in the instructions.

### Rough-In Drawings

Rough-in drawings for the EDFP210FP, EDFP214FP, and EDFP217FP models are provided to assist with proper placement. Confirm that the wall is prepped as shown before installation, to comply with standards.

### Cable Sheath Adjustment and Water Flow

Adjust the cable sheath for optimal performance. Ensure the fountain is mounted at a height compatible with its operating specifications. If the fountain is recessed, verify that the front and top sections are adjusted correctly for the best accessibility. The fountain should allow for unimpeded operation of the push-buttons without excessive resistance, which can disrupt water flow.

### Water Supply Connection

Using unplated copper tubing, connect the cold water supply to the building's water inlet. The service stop is not included. Quick connect fittings can be managed easily by pushing the tube into the collet to secure it, and pulling it out requires the collet to be released.
