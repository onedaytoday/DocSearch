**Earth Continuity and Safety Checks**

1. **Earth Continuity Assessment**: Verify the continuity of the earth connection. If any connections are faulty or not secure, address these issues. Ensure all plugs, including cover and insulation, are properly connected.

2. **Insulation Testing**: Disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply and ensure all switches are in the ON position. Use electrical testing leads to check insulation; a reading indicating less than infinity signifies an issue. If any abnormalities are detected, further inspection is required, particularly around areas where burning or arcing is evident.

3. **Polarity Verification**: Confirm that the polarity of the supply matches expected values, ensuring correct wiring from terminals 'N' and 'L' while operating the switches correctly to check continuity.

4. **Commissioning Procedure**: To begin commissioning, adjust the settings to their maximum and minimum levels, then return the settings smoothly from minimum to maximum. If any indicators extinguish at this stage, consult the troubleshooting steps.

5. **Testing Procedure**: Perform the testing with controlled adjustments using a thin screwdriver for precise operations. Ensure safety during testing by turning off the gas supply as necessary and confirming functional readiness of the system.

6. **Conversion to LPG**: When converting from another gas type to LPG, turn off the electricity supply and follow the outlined procedures. Adjust the LPG injectors and ensure settings are correct according to the device's rating plate.

**Important Note**: Always reference the user manual specific to your model (AEG D-90327) for detailed instructions and safety measures in servicing and using the appliance.

**Products and Services Note**: Regular maintenance and cleaning products should be used as recommended, ensuring the appliance operates efficiently over its lifespan, as outlined by the manufacturer.
