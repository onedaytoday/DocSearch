For installation through narrow areas, it is advisable to follow specific preparation steps. This may include removing the necessary parts such as hinges and screws to facilitate the passage.

#### Connecting the Water Supply
Ensure compatibility with your household water supply system. Seek a qualified professional if needed. Follow the guidelines for proper connections to prevent leaks and ensure optimal functioning.

### UNDERSTANDING FEATURES

Allow the refrigerator to cool before use and to stabilize temperature settings. The cooling temperature controls are located at the top and can be adjusted to achieve desired levels. Display indicators will flash if settings are incorrectly configured.

### COOLING SYSTEM MONITORING

The cooling system features notifications via lights and tones to indicate system status. Steady lights mean active cooling, while flashing indicators convey issues that require attention.

The adjustable cantilever shelves allow flexible storage options for fresh food and can be easily cleaned. The drawers are designed to maintain high humidity for specific food items, ensuring freshness.

### ACCESSORIES

Specific bottle designs and compartments allow storage for various sizes of containers, providing organization and easy access. Compartments are included to safely store spreads and other items.

Always consult the user manual for detailed instructions and safety precautions.

### Water Dispenser Operation

**Using the Water Dispenser:**

To dispense water, utilize the control panel to select between options such as cubed or crushed ice. The system also allows you to adjust the water flow rate. When you activate the crushed ice option, it efficiently catches and dispenses the desired amount, facilitating easy cleaning.

**Control Panel Functions:**

The control panel features indicators for various settings. Press the appropriate button to activate the desired feature, which is indicated by the corresponding light. When engaged, the system efficiently serves water and ice, allowing you to specify choices based on your needs. 

**Priming the Water Supply System:**

Before initial use, the water supply system must be primed to function correctly. If the system is connected improperly, it may lead to malfunctions. Ensure that you follow proper procedures, including holding the relevant buttons as necessary for optimal operation.

**Ice Dispenser Care:**

The ice dispenser should be properly maintained to ensure that ice is produced effectively within a specific timeframe. If the ice supply isn't functioning as expected, check the On/Off switch to confirm that it is operational.

**Cleaning Recommendations:**

Periodically clean the components using a damp cloth and mild cleaners to avoid build-up. Follow specific instructions for turning the machine off before cleaning to ensure safety. 

**Water Filter Replacement:**

Replace the water filter every six months to maintain optimal performance. The filter is located at the top of the fresh food compartment, and itâ€™s important to consult your owner's manual for replacement specifications. 

**Food Storage Tips:**

For effective food storage, avoid overcrowding shelves, as this can hinder airflow and cooling efficiency. Properly wrap or store food items to prevent freezer burn and ensure freshness.

**Understanding Operational Sounds:**

Some operational sounds are normal and indicate that the refrigerator is functioning correctly. Sounds may include clicking and hissing during defrost cycles and when the cooling system engages or disengages.

**Care Tips for Maintenance:**

To protect the appliance and maintain its appearance, regular cleaning is necessary. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that could scratch surfaces. Proper care will extend the lifespan of the unit.

**Replacing Light Bulbs:**

When replacing light bulbs, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply for safety. Use appropriate bulbs as specified in the owner's manual and follow guidelines for installation.

Following these guidelines will help you maintain your water dispenser effectively while ensuring optimal performance for all features.
