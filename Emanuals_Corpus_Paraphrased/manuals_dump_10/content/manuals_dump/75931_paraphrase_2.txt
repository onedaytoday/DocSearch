Here is a paraphrased version of the provided text:

To ensure optimal operation, make sure the appliance is turned off when not in use and that it is properly closed. It's essential to maintain appropriate cooling and humidity levels. Allow food items to be naturally cooled before placing them on the shelves to prevent frost accumulation. Foods should be kept covered or sealed on their respective shelves. The height of the shelves can be adjusted as needed.

Fresh meat, seafood, dairy products, and ready-made meals should be stored in designated areas within the appliance according to a reference chart. It is important to cool foods quickly, especially if they have been recently purchased. The appliance features a FROSTMATIC function for rapid cooling, indicated by a yellow light. Use buttons designated (I) and (K) to set the desired temperature, which will be displayed alongside the actual temperature. If you want to revert back to the actual settings, press the appropriate button.

To activate, press button (A), which will cause the light (M) to flash and emit a sound when the desired temperature is reached. Once the temperature is set using buttons (I) or (K), the desired setting will display. The FROSTMATIC function protects both fresh food and items that have already been frozen.

Cleaning is essential; ensure to defrost and clean the appliance regularly using appropriate methods without harsh chemicals. It is advisable to maintain the cleanliness of both the compartments and shelves to enhance performance and preserve food quality.

Any technical issues or unusual sounds should be addressed immediately. Consult the provided information for details about troubleshooting or service assistance. Additionally, ensuring proper placement and spacing of products within the appliance will help prevent frost buildup and enhance cooling efficiency. 

For installation, connect the appliance according to voltage specifications and use proper wiring standards. Any issues with electrical supply or visible damage should be addressed by a qualified technician to prevent hazards.
