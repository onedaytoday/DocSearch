**Important Safety Instructions:**

1. **Fire Hazard:** Ensure the microwave operates correctly to prevent overheating and potential fire risks. Do not leave food unattended, and if heating food excessively, be cautious about smoke and fire.
2. **Door Safety:** If food seems overheated, do not open the door immediately. Turn off the microwave and allow the food to cool before checking.
3. **Suitable Containers:** Use microwave-safe materials. Avoid plastic or other unsuitable containers that might melt or degrade.
4. **Cleaning:** Regularly clean the cavity, turntable, and cover to avoid grease buildup that can lead to overheating or fires.
5. **Warnings for Specific Users:** Individuals with pacemakers must consult with a physician regarding safe usage. 

**Operation Guidelines:**

- Always ensure that tightly sealed foods are vented while microwaving to prevent pressure buildup.
- Be careful when heating liquids or foods that may splatter; use caution to avoid burns.
- Teach children about microwave safety and ensure they are monitored during operation.

**Accessories:** 

Your microwave comes with the following accessories: 
- Turntable

### Understanding Microwaves:

Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic wave that cooks by agitating water molecules in food, generating heat. They enable faster cooking and defrosting due to the unique cooking process that targets the food's moisture.

**Heat Resistance:**

Use heat-resistant dishes designed for microwaves. Avoid containers that may become too hot or shatter in the microwave.

**Follow Recommendations:**

Always adhere to the specific cooking times and temperatures provided in this manual. Overcooking can result in unwanted smoke and potential fires.

### Troubleshooting:

If you encounter operational issues or need to perform maintenance, please contact an authorized service technician.

Thank you for your attention to these instructions, and enjoy your cooking with the AEG microwave!

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH: Food Testing and Cooking Guidance**

To ensure food is cooked properly, use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature of dishes while cooking or reheating. This tool helps determine if food has reached a safe temperature, preventing undercooking or overcooking. The cooking chart below provides recommended internal temperatures for various foods, including poultry and meats.

When cooking, be aware that different items may require different cooking times, especially when using a microwave. Foods with layers may cook unevenly, so covering them can prevent drying out and promote even heating. For blanching, ensure foods are covered and heated promptly post-blanching to maintain quality.

Microwave reheating is straightforward and often requires less time compared to traditional cooking methods. When reheating, remember that adding or reducing the quantity of food can change cooking times significantly—almost doubling the time for double the amount of food.

**Microwave Cooking Best Practices:**
1. **Cover Food**: During microwave cooking, covering the dish helps retain moisture and ensures even cooking. If food has significant density variations, such as thick pieces or takes time to heat through, cover adequately.
2. **Turning/Stirring**: To promote even heating, turn or stir food midway through the cooking process.
3. **Defrosting**: Defrost food using a lower microwave setting to prevent cooking the outer layers while the interior remains frozen. Thinner items will defrost faster than thicker ones, so adjust times accordingly.

**Cooking with Quality:**
- Ingredients should be fresh and adequately prepared before cooking.
- For meats and layered dishes, allow sufficient time to ensure thorough cooking throughout.
- When using a microwave, food items usually need a shorter duration compared to conventional cooking methods, especially for dense or large items.

**Microwave Operation:**
- Adjust cooking time via the TIMER/WEIGHT/PORTION knob.
- Select the appropriate MICROWAVE POWER LEVEL for your dish, pressing the start button when ready.
- For multi-stage cooking, input each stage using the TIMER/WEIGHT/PORTION dial as needed.

**Quick Start Function**: This feature allows immediate cooking by pressing the START/QUICK button for a set duration.

**Safety Features:**
- To activate the safety lock, press and hold the STOP button for a few seconds.
- To cancel the safety lock, repeat the same process, allowing for user safety during operation.

Review the manufacturer's instructions for specific recommendations on cooking times and best practices to achieve optimum results.

- **AUTO DEFROST**: For various meats (e.g., minced meat, poultry), follow the specific procedures outlined for each type and rearrange as needed during cooking to ensure even thawing.

### Recipe Adaptation:

When adapting traditional recipes for microwave cooking, consider the following adjustments:

- Reduce cooking time by one-third to one-half.
- Follow the recipes suggested which indicate high moisture retention, such as stews or casseroles.
- Consider reducing the quantity of high-fat ingredients.

### Example Recipes:

**Mince and Onion**:
- Combine minced meat, finely chopped onion, and seasonings. Cover and cook using the AUTO COOK function. Stir and monitor periodically.

**Fish Fillet with Sauce**:
- Place fish fillet with chopped onions and desired sauce in a microwave-safe dish. Cover and use the AUTO COOK function for appropriate duration.

Ensure all cooking materials are suitable for microwave use and that food is evenly distributed in the cooking vessel to promote uniform heating.

Certainly! Here’s the text paraphrased in a natural, technical way while preserving its meaning:

---

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH Meat**: For cooking meat from Austria with stuffing, finely chop a white bunch of parsley or use a thick thread for ties. Grease your cooking vessel and prepare the meat, seasoning it appropriately. Combine the parsley with the meat mixture before stuffing. Preheat your cooking equipment and cook the meat without turning it during the initial phase. Once properly cooked, allow it to rest for a while. Season again and secure tightly. Continue cooking until finished, turning once. For a roast, cover the meat appropriately during cooking.

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH Meat, Mince and Onions**: When cooking minced meat with finely chopped onions, ensure proper seasoning. Prepare the onions by browning them, then mix with minced meat. Carefully layer the meat mixture and cover, allowing it to cook through. The fricassee should be cooked until tender and seasoned adequately. Serve garnished with parsley.

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH Meat, with Fromage**: Use grated cheese and chopped onions for the stuffing mixture with minced meat. Grease the cooking surface adequately. Carefully fill each portion of the meat with the mixture and cover it. Heat and allow the mixture to thicken as required. Arrange the meat in a single layer and cook until done.

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH Shallow Cooking Meat**: For shallow cooking of meat with finely chopped onions, season and prepare the dish by layering ingredients. Cook under a cover to ensure even heat distribution. It is crucial to let it cook through without frequently interrupting. Use grated cheese as a finishing touch, ensuring all components are seasoned adequately.

**AG-32D-UK ENGLISH Cleaning Guidelines**: CAUTION: AVOID USING COMMERCIAL OVEN CLEANERS, STEAM CLEANERS, ABRASIVES, OR ANY PRODUCTS CONTAINING SODIUM HYDROXIDE ON ANY PART OF THE MICROWAVE OVEN. Clean easily with a damp cloth, ensuring the surfaces are dry afterward. Use gentle cleaners as necessary. If the microwave doesn’t function properly, check that it is correctly closed, and ensure that the turntable is clean and functioning. Note: Cooking on high can lead to overheating; adjust settings as needed. Clean the turntable and its components regularly, using a dishwasher-safe method when applicable.
