### FOOD STORAGE RECOMMENDATIONS

For optimal preservation, fresh food should be stored without overcrowding shelves, as this enhances airflow and cooling efficiency. Meat items should be securely wrapped and separated from other foods. Maintaining the refrigerator temperature at or below 40°F enables it to function effectively. When loading items, ensure that food is not tightly packed, allowing cool air to circulate freely. Be mindful of harder-to-freeze foods; these should be placed appropriately on the shelves to prevent freezer burn.

### ENERGY EFFICIENCY TIPS

To minimize energy use, limit direct sunlight exposure on your appliances and find ways to reduce heat generated by devices such as stoves or dishwashers. Proper insulation is essential for efficient operation. Also, avoid blocking internal areas with excess items, as this can hinder air circulation.

### UNDERSTANDING REFRIGERATOR NOISES

You may notice various sounds while your refrigerator operates, including air flow through vents, hissing from the defrost heater, or clicking during the defrost cycle. These noises are typical and indicate normal functioning. If the unit is overheating or making unusual sounds, maintenance may be necessary.

### REFRIGERATOR MAINTENANCE

Always clean the condenser coils as instructed for optimal performance. Regularly assess the cleanliness of both internal compartments to prevent build-up. Ensure the light bulbs are replaced according to the user manual for continued illumination.

### WARRANTY INFORMATION

Your refrigerator is covered under a limited warranty for two years from the date of purchase in the U.S. This includes coverage for parts and workmanship. For additional years, specific components such as the sealed system are covered under extended warranties. Consumers are responsible for certain expenses, including service calls from unauthorized technicians.

In Canada, a full one-year warranty is also provided, with further coverage available for specific components over subsequent years.

For any service needs, contact the manufacturer's authorized service providers. Warranty clauses specify exceptions for external damages and ensure that certain upkeep responsibilities fall on the consumer.

**Section on Common Issues:**

The temperature may be too low, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Ensure that components are cleaned and adequately insulated or wrapped. 

**Normal Sounds and Visual Indicators:**

For proper installation, verify the quality of the workmanship. Additionally, check and replace parts as needed. Ensure the temperature is adjusted to "O" and increased to a satisfactory warmth. Allow several hours for the system to stabilize. 

For the light switch, found in the designated location, make sure to switch it on to release any locks. The ice buildup should not exceed a specific weight limit, and the water supply should be turned off if it is excessive.
