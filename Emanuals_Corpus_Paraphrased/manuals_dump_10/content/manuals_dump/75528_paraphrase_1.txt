### Tips for Effective Cooking and Maintenance

#### Placement and Cooking Techniques

When placing food in the oven, position it centrally on the shelf, counted from the top, with space around it to minimize cleaning efforts. Using enamelware can enhance browning, but heavier items may also increase cooking efficiency. For optimal heat distribution, ensure food is placed centrally on the cooking shelves, allowing heat to circulate freely.

#### Cooking Charts

Use the provided cooking charts for guidance on shelf placement and cooking times for various foods, including meringues, pastries, and meats. For best results, adjust cooking times according to the recommended temperatures.

#### Slow Cooking Guidelines

Slow cooking is ideal for tougher cuts of meat and is cost-effective. Cooking at low heat allows for better flavor development. Ensure meats are thawed properly and use a thermometer to check doneness, aiming for at least 88°C. Cover dishes to retain moisture and flavor while cooking.

#### Care and Cleaning

Allow the appliance to cool before cleaning. Use recommended cleaners that are safe for the finish, avoiding bleach or abrasive materials. Clean surfaces gently with a suitable cloth and avoid scouring pads.

#### Maintaining Hotplate Burners

When replacing hotplate burner components, ensure they fit correctly without forcing them into place. If ignitions fail, double-check the arrangement and connections of the burners.

#### Cleaning Shelves and Grill

Shelves and grill components should be cleaned regularly to maintain performance. Avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage finishes.

#### Issues and Troubleshooting

If performance issues arise, consult the troubleshooting guide to identify potential causes and solutions. This includes checking heat settings, ensuring proper cooking times, and verifying appliance conditions.
