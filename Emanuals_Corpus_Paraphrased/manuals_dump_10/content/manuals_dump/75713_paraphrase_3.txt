**Chillers GN Overview**

The GN chillers rapidly cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively minimizing bacterial growth. This process enables safe food storage at +3°C without compromising quality. The chilling systems offer multiple operational modes, including Soft Chilling (down to 2°C) and faster chilling to 20°C. Each cooling cycle operates continuously and adheres to NF and UK regulations, incorporating built-in UV sanitation (available as an accessory), defrosting features, and countdown timers for service notifications.

**Performance**

These chillers are designed to rapidly bring food temperatures down from +90°C to +3°C, optimizing the chilling process based on the quantity and type of products. Compliance with NF regulations ensures safe handling through all stages, including monitoring and recording information for HACCP standards.
