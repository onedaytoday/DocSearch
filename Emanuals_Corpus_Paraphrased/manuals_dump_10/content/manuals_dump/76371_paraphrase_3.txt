### Preventive Maintenance

To ensure proper functioning and service, the following steps should be implemented. Clean the system every three months and inspect for any noticeable issues. Preventive measures should include cleaning and only using authorized personnel to handle internal components. Inspect internal hoses and address any necessary repairs. If the heating mechanism is malfunctioning, check the switch settings and confirm functionality.  

### Troubleshooting Information  

Refer to the troubleshooting section for guidance on identified issues. Ensure that the system is within the specified voltage regulations (300V) to maintain protective earth standards. Check the LED indicators for any alerts over a few seconds as part of troubleshooting.

### Error Codes from CPU  

Common error codes from the CPU include:  
- **ERROR NO WATER:** Indicates lack of water input.  
- **EMERGENCY TIMEOUT:** Occurs when heating is disabled.  
- **I/O COMMUNICATION ERRORS:** Suggests interconnectivity issues that need to be verified.  

Additional diagnostic messages such as **DC High** and **RDC/MCU too high** will help pinpoint faults.

### Service Activation  

To activate service mode for models WD4130, WD4240, or WB4130H, locate the service switch on the CPU board under the top cover. Press the switch to initiate service functions for troubleshooting purposes.

### Additional Troubleshooting  

Monitor the CPU for specific conditions:  
- **DOOR OPEN:** Indicates that the door is not securely closed.  
- **DOOR LOCK FAIL:** Signals a failure in the door locking mechanism.  
- **NTC HIGH/LOW TEMP:** Alerts about temperature extremes detected by the NTC sensor.  
- **OVERFILLED:** Indicates too much water in the machine. Action: Check hose flow and drain mechanisms.  
- **NO HEATING:** Suggests issues with the heater or thermal response.  

### General Recommendations  

For errors associated with **I/O COMMUNICATION** and mechanical interlocks, confirm connections and functionality of all relevant components. Address any issues by readdressing the I/O boards and checking wiring integrity. If malfunctions persist or if specific thresholds are exceeded, specific actions such as blowing through hoses may be required to ensure proper serviceability.  

For persistent errors or issues with initialized commands, consult additional documentation or technical support for necessary interventions.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### MOTOR OVERHEATING
When troubleshooting a motor that is overheating, first observe each of the three phases. If the readings from any of the phases exceed 150Â°C, the motor's protection system has activated. Excessive heat may be due to mechanical issues, such as binding, or electrical faults. To identify the problem, check the three phases and compare their temperature readings; the operational range should ideally be around 90Â°C. 

#### NO INTERLOCK
If there is no interlock, ensure that the 230V/50Hz supply to the system is closed and locked. Commands are sent from the system to maintain interlock status. If the interlock has been triggered, verify that the input conditions are correct. The interlock system may engage if activated unintentionally. Actions include checking interlock status at terminals X302:1-2 and confirming correct service conditions.

#### MOTOR SHORT CIRCUIT
For a motor exhibiting a continuous short circuit, check the tachometer readings. If it indicates high values or remains stationary, a short may be triggered. Restart the motor to see if it operates normally. Possible causes for a short circuit include internal faults or impaired efficiency. Consult the MCU Fault Logger for detailed error codes related to short circuits, particularly if the last fault code is N/8.

#### INTERLOCK HARDWARE
Ensure that the interlock input receives 230V/50Hz. If the interlock is activated incorrectly, this could indicate malfunctioning hardware. 

#### LOW DC VOLTAGE
Monitor the DC voltage input. If the voltage drops below acceptable levels, the system may become inactive. Review the MCU Fault Logger for errors related to undervoltage.

#### HIGH DC VOLTAGE
Regularly check the input voltage. If the level exceeds the permissible limit, the system will deactivate. Consult the FC Fault Logger for details on the overvoltage error.

#### NO PARAMETER SET IN MCU
If there are no parameters set in the Motor Control Unit (MCU), the system settings may not have been written correctly. Power off the MCU for at least ten seconds and then reboot to refresh settings.

#### MOTOR NOT FOLLOWING
If the motor fails to follow the expected rotation, identify breaks in each phase of operation to resolve the issue and consult FC Error Logger for the last error code related to this fault.

#### CHECKSUM ERROR FROM CPU
A discrepancy between the internal counts of the DLCU and CPU indicates potential interference. Take measures to address environmental factors that may be affecting performance.

#### CHARGE CIRCUIT FAULT
If the charge circuit isn't functioning, it could be due to improper arming. Confirm CPU and DLCU status and ensure they've completed necessary processes without interruption.

#### TACHO SIGNAL FAILURE
If the DLCU indicates no tachometer signal, verify that the tachometer relay is operational and that it communicates correctly with the CPU.

#### SET SPEED DOOR OPEN
Ensure that the door switch is operational and that the DLCU does not trigger when the door is open.

#### ACTUATOR CIRCUIT ISSUE
Continuous signals from the DLCU may indicate an actuator fault. Monitor the system for communication breakdowns possibly due to hardware failures.

#### SHORT TEMP INPUT SENSOR
If the thermistor for the inlet temp sensor is shorted, it will need replacement according to service guidelines.

#### SHORT TEMP OUTPUT SENSOR
A short in the outlet temp sensor thermistor will also require attention and may necessitate a replacement.

#### FAN MOTOR OVERHEATING
Check for mechanical issues that may be causing the thermal protection switch to engage on the fan motor.

#### DRUM MOTOR OVERHEATING
Similar to the fan motor, ensure that there are no blockages or issues triggering protective shutdown on the drum motor.

#### EXTERNAL ERROR
If the machine shows an external error, it may be linked to incorrect connections or operational parameters.

#### INCORRECT PROGRAMMING
Confirm that the machine has been programmed correctly as per service guidelines.

For operational issues or error codes not listed, please consult the Electrolux service support resources for further troubleshooting.
