**Power Supply Activation and Recording Process:**

1. **Activate Power Supply:** Turn on the supply (refer to P105).
2. **Start Recording:** To begin recording, press the [REC] button. The device records directly to the SD memory card, which should be properly formatted and is recommended to be at least 1GB in capacity. Ensure the necessary settings are configured (see P110 for details).
3. **Monitor Recording:** The [REC] indicator will illuminate while recording. You can view relevant information via the OSD (On-Screen Display).
4. **Recording Controls:** Press [REC] once to initiate recording. For further options, access the [MENU] to navigate the recording hierarchy and make selections with the [ENTER] key.
5. **Recording Quality Settings:** You have options to adjust the recording quality and set parameters such as the record rate, counter, and LCD brightness.
6. **Memory Capacity Considerations:** Be aware of the SD card's capacity; a 1GB card will limit recording time based on the quality settings chosen.
7. **Playback Features:** To access recorded content, press [ENTER] and select from the available options in the playback menu. You can pause, rewind, or fast-forward using specific buttons.
8. **Switching Between Features:** Utilize the [MENU] key to toggle between various options, adjusting playback or recording settings as necessary.
9. **Connecting External Devices:** 
    - To connect a microphone, ensure it is properly attached to the input of the recorder. Verify connection status on the LCD.
    - For AV (Audio/Video) connections, link using RCA connectors, ensuring the correct input and output formats for your region.
10. **Formatting SD Cards:** Access SD card settings via the [MENU] to format the memory card when necessary. Confirm actions with the [ENTER] button.
11. **Firmware Management:** Regularly check for firmware updates to ensure optimal performance. Refer to specific instructions for connecting the device to a PC for updates (see P134).
12. **Operational Controls:** Use the [UP] and [DOWN] buttons to navigate through the items in the OSD, and remember to confirm actions with [ENTER]. 

Always reference the operation manual for precise guidelines and maintenance recommendations to ensure seamless functionality.
