To integrate the following products into your home theater system, ensure compatibility with the VCR and other devices. The system is designed to deliver an immersive audio experience that synchronizes sound effects with on-screen action. Specifically, it utilizes advanced amplifiers for home theater sound, effectively enhancing the audio landscape.

The setup emphasizes the distinction between front and surround sound; this is crucial for creating realistic soundscapes. The system excels at conveying bass frequencies from actions such as explosions, resulting in an engaging listening experience. 

For optimal performance, connect the active subwoofer immediately. This involves routing cables from the system to the subwoofer. Ensure that the connections are made to the appropriate channels, including the front and rear outputs.

The active subwoofer is designed to produce clear sound, with the capability to adjust the phase to mitigate any undesirable bass interference. Itâ€™s essential to position the subwoofer correctly to avoid acoustic issues related to room dynamics. If necessary, move the unit away from walls or corners for better sound dispersion. 

**Note:** Always ensure power cables are properly insulated to prevent electrical shock. Be cautious when servicing the system; refer to user manuals for operational guidelines and troubleshooting advice. If issues arise, make sure the subwoofer is connected correctly; the LED indicator will help confirm power status.
