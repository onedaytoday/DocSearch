### OPERATION PROCEDURES

To power on the device, turn the switch to the "ON" position. If the switch is turned on and then quickly turned off, wait a few seconds before attempting to turn it back on. Use the [TELE/WIDE] buttons for operation, or the wireless remote for this purpose. For focusing, press the [AUTO FOCUS] button on the front or the [AF] button on the remote. This function adjusts to the height based on the [TELE] setting when the device is in use as depicted in the images provided. 

**Reference Connections:**
- RS-232
- POWER ON/OFF
- AC IN
- RGB IN/OUT
- RS-232C
- VIDEO OUT

### STORING THE VISUAL PRESENTER

Ensure the device is powered off, and properly adjust the lighting as shown. If alternate settings are required, adjust the lighting (R) and rotate the head as appropriate, maintaining a slight rearward tilt. The lighting (L) must be adjusted to its specified position. If necessary, apply force carefully when transporting the unit.

### VARIOUS FUNCTIONS

**Lighting Control:** 
Use the [LAMP] button on the wireless remote to control the lighting, which can switch between on and off states. Refer to the OSD for brightness settings. 

For optimal 3-D presentations, ensure the lights are adequately set. Adjust the [TELE] or [WIDE] buttons on the front or via the wireless remote to manipulate zoom levels.

The [POINTER] function can be activated via the remote, making it visible on the screen. This function impacts only the RGB output. To initiate the one-shot focusing, press the [AUTO FOCUS] button from the front or the [AF] button from the remote. Once focusing is achieved, the function will automatically deactivate, retaining the focus.

If the focusing needs adjustment due to lighting conditions or background movement, use the [NEAR] or [FAR] buttons on the remote. 

### IRIS CONTROL

Utilize the wireless remote buttons to [OPEN], [CLOSE], or set to [AUTO IRIS] as needed. 

**PAUSE FUNCTION:**
Pressing the [PAUSE] button on the wireless remote will suspend the current operation. 

For coordinating functions and troubleshooting, reference the OSD items as necessary.

### COMMUNICATION THROUGH RS-232C

Connect the PC to the device via RS-232C as indicated. Ensure that the In/Out switch is appropriately set to facilitate communication. The device will transmit commands and receive acknowledgments based on successful connections.

### TROUBLESHOOTING HINTS

If the device does not power on, check connections to the AC power source and ensure the switch is in the ON position. For issues with focus, verify the TELE and WIDE settings and perform necessary adjustments. If persistent problems arise, consult ELMO's authorized service.
