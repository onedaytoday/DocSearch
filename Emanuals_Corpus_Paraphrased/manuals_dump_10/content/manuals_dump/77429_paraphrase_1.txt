### LNG Section Overview

**Port/Communication Interface**
The LNG Section features common communication protocols such as RS-232 and RS-485, including Ethernet connections. The preferred CPU and LED part number is DMC-004936. The RS-232 is connected directly to the PC using a DB-9 connector, where the wiring consists of three color-coded signals: RED connects to RX, WHITE to TX, and BLACK to COM. The system supports both RS-232 and RS-485, with the capability for automatic detection and configuration.

**Installation Requirements**
To integrate the LNG Flow system with a PC, the DB-9 connector must be correctly wired: RX, TX, and COM. 

**I/O Configuration**
The LNG Flow system includes multiple output configurations (e.g., FODO1, FODO2, FODO3) that provide uncorrected flow data based on specific criteria (e.g., flow direction). The outputs can operate in conjunction with TTL-level signals and have options for phase reporting.

**Signal Isolation**
FODO outputs are opto-isolated from the CPU, providing at least 500V isolation to ensure safety and prevent noise interference in the system. Each FODO channel has specific grounding requirements to maintain signal integrity.

**Input Specifications**
The LNG Flow system allows for isolated 24VDC service inputs which can be monitored using HART functionality compatible with DMC-004936. The flow data can be tracked for various conditions, and specific settings allow for polarity adjustments as needed.

**Security Protocols**
Configuration involves managing security settings through the WRITE PROT. switch on the CPU, ensuring correct wiring to maintain system integrity. Procedures for securing the installation and maintaining reliability are outlined and must be followed closely.

**Installation Procedures**
For securing the LNG Flow module, appropriate tools should be employed, adhering to specified torque settings during assembly. The seals should be confirmed as tested and sealed correctly.

**Software Installation**
The system requires an established software connection through Ethernet or direct input. The directory must be configured to recognize both primary and secondary IP addresses as part of the setup process.

**System Configuration and HART Settings**
During operation, users must select various options related to flow rates and action behaviors to configure the system adequately. This includes settings for flow correction and phase adjustments.

**AMS Integration**
The AMS (Asset Management System) software requires downloading of device descriptors (DD). Users must ensure proper search parameters are set to locate the correct versions for communication and setup.

**Section LNG AMS Flow Configuration**

The LNG AMS flow settings are outlined below. To implement changes, click on the appropriate source and select it from the options, ensuring the collector and TTL configurations correspond with the specific VDC (each phase). If necessary, refresh the source to apply updates and return to previous configurations to verify reflections in the other settings. Click on the flow direction, phase lead or lag, and note the polarity and units displayed in the HART assembly.

For flow threshold settings in the LNG AMS, adjust the cutoff for flow velocity. If the measured batch falls below this value, the settings will require a new configuration. Post-configuration, if you see "Completed Successfully," proceed to adjust the flow velocity offset. Be aware that if the configuration includes the new AMS parameters, these need to be accounted for. Access the flow path information for details on flow direction and performance metrics such as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

**Section LNG Service Procedures**

In the LNG AMS service panel, navigate to the graphical representation of primary, secondary, and additional flow metrics. To modify the K-Factors, which are read-only, select the corresponding configurations and click "Next" to proceed. Ensure the Protect switch is activated for CPU safety.

**Section LNG Configuration Procedures**

Follow the configurations as described, ensuring that any security features and hardware setups are correctly addressed.
