Manufactured by Professional, Inc., these products can be found at www.electroluxusa.com/professional. Each model comes with a 5-20P plug and is suitable for high-performance cooking, thanks to their top plates which are coated for resistance to scratches and oxidation. 

The shock-resistant heating elements provide excellent thermal conductivity, complemented by a built-in thermostat with a range up to 450Â°F. The plates are constructed from AISI-approved materials suitable for food preparation and designed to withstand oxidation. These products are ETL listed and comply with NEMA 5-20P standards, ensuring safety and reliability. 

For maintenance, it is recommended to clean the unit at least once daily, particularly after heavy usage. Ensure that the grease is emptied regularly to maintain optimal performance.
