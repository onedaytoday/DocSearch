Please ensure that the following items are included: a TV (DVB-S) with a Conditional Access Module (CAM) and a software CD-ROM containing a PDF. Connect the LNB to the TV and power sources appropriately (AC input and DC power from the AAA batteries). Thank you for your purchase; setup and recording will be available shortly.

After unpacking, connect the RG-6 cable from the LNB to the ANT IN on the TV. The system will configure automaticallyâ€”please follow the on-screen instructions. This setup process is for receiving DVB broadcasts.

If you need to purchase a CAM and service, once the TV is activated, you can access recordings via the on-screen prompts or Electronic Program Guide (EPG). Note: If you decide to switch types or settings, please refer to the software instructions. Choose your switch type and optionally install additional software from the CD-ROM. After installation, you can access the PDF guide from the provided CD-ROM to complete the software setup.
