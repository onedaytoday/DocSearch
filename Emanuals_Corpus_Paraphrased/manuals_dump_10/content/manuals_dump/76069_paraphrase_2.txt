### Achieving Optimal Results

For best results on carpets and hard floors, ensure you use the appropriate suction settings as indicated. For lightweight applications, ensure the setup is as shown. The cleaning tool can be used to reach crevices and corners, and accessories may need to be purchased separately. Always ensure the cleaner is switched off before adjusting any stationary components.
