The oven has a built-in feature that allows temperatures to be set between 170°F and 550°F (65°C to 287°C). To use this function, turn the dial to the desired temperature; the oven will begin heating and automatically shut off when it reaches the set temperature. 

### Starting the Oven:
- To begin, turn the dial to the desired setting and press the appropriate button to set the time.
- When cooking items like meat or poultry, they should be prepped first, and if storing chilled, cook them promptly after an hour to maintain safety. 

### Using Bake Timer:
- The oven will turn off automatically after the bake time is complete. 
- The timer system allows for easy monitoring; once the time is up, the oven indicator will read "END" and turn off. 

### Preventing Grease Fires:
- Carefully manage cooking temperatures and avoid covering food while cooking to reduce smoke and grease accumulation. 
- Always have a fire extinguisher on hand for emergencies and avoid using water on grease fires.

### Self-Cleaning Feature:
- The self-clean cycle functions at high temperatures, and it is critical not to use any other cleaning methods during this time.
- Ensure that racks and walls are resistant to high heat and will not be damaged by the cleaning process.
- Follow safety precautions, such as allowing the oven to cool before manually cleaning after a self-clean cycle.

### General Cleaning:
- Clean using cloths suitable for different surfaces and avoid abrasive materials that might scratch the surfaces.
- Apply cleaners specifically designed for the oven surface and always follow the manufacturer's guidelines to avoid damage.

### Light Maintenance:
- The oven light can be accessed by removing screws from the cover, following proper instructions for safety when changing bulbs.

Always take necessary precautions when handling the oven to ensure safe use and maintenance.

### Self-Cleaning Performance Guidelines

**Self-Cleaning Operation**  
To initiate the self-cleaning cycle, turn the appliance OFF and adjust the settings as follows: If the oven temperature is excessively high or low beyond the recommended range (typically ±35°F or ±5°F), adjustments will need to be made. 

1. **Adjustment Process**: 
   - To modify the temperature offset, turn the control knob clockwise within a few seconds. High (HI) settings can be selected to increase temperature, while Low (LO) can decrease it. 
   - The "OVEN" light will flash in conjunction with the "LOCK" light to indicate an offset adjustment has been made.
   - Each 5°F increment will cause the "OVEN" light to flash. If the light flashes three times, the offset is set to 15°F. 

2. **Service and Troubleshooting**:  
   - Service issues can arise if the appliance is not heating adequately or if the lights are malfunctioning. Follow the provided instructions carefully to address common issues.
   - If the appliance is improperly fitted or the cookware is unsuitable (such as warped or heavy items), heating performance may suffer.
