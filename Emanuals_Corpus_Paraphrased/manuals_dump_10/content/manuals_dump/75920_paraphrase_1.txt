#### Operating Instructions
- **Controls**: The control panel includes buttons for various power sources ("AC", "DC", "GAS") and an "OFF" mode. The corresponding LED indicators will flash when the unit is in operation.

- **Starting the Refrigerator**: To activate gas operation, switch to "GAS". Listen for a ticking sound indicating ignition. Once lit, the LED will stop flashing. Adjust thermostat settings as needed.

- **Regulating Temperature**: Allow several hours for the unit to reach optimal temperature. Set the thermostat according to the desired cooling level.

- **Travel Catch**: Ensure both door catches are engaged during travel to maintain proper cooling.

- **Food Storage**: Store food in a way that allows proper airflow to prevent spoilage. Bottles may burst if frozen.

#### Ice Making
For ice production, ensure the cooling system is set below the required temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent excessive cold.

#### Defrosting
Defrost when excessive frost builds up. Use caution to avoid damaging components. Use a cloth to wipe excess moisture.

#### Cleaning the Refrigerator
Clean with a mild cloth; avoid harsh scouring products which may damage surfaces. Ensure the unit is turned off while cleaning.

#### Heating Cable
Use the DC heating cable during colder months to maintain food freshness. The switch is located beneath the fridge.

#### Winter Operation
In colder temperatures (below 10°C), use winter covers to enhance performance.

#### Turning Off the Refrigerator
Switch to "OFF" and empty the unit if storing for winter. Disconnect power and ensure all food is removed.

#### Troubleshooting
If the fridge fails to operate:
- Ensure all startup instructions were followed.
- Confirm that gas and electrical supplies are intact.
- Check the thermostat settings and seek professional assistance if needed.

#### Maintenance
Regular checks are advised, particularly of LP components. Professional servicing should be conducted as necessary.

#### Installation Instructions
- **Repositioning Hinges**: Follow instructions for adjusting door hinges as required for installation.

- **Ventilation**: Ensure proper ventilation to optimize performance and prevent overheating. Position the unit away from direct heat sources.

- **Gas Connection**: Verify that the gas supply is correct and securely connected. Refer to the reducing valve for settings.

Please observe all safety precautions during installation and operation.

This device is designed for continuous operation, utilizing a bottled and threaded connection. **PUSH-ON CONNECTIONS ARE NOT PERMISSIBLE** for permanently installed configurations of this type in the United States. The connections should be secure and utilize a gas-tight fit, specifically with bottled supplies rated appropriately for servicing. Ensure the outlet of the valve is easily accessible for maintenance.

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTION**: Adhere to all regulations and operational guidelines to ensure proper grounding of the unit. The electricity supply must be adequately earthed, and the outlet should be within reach. Use wires color-coded as follows: green/yellow for ground, brown for live, and blue for neutral. Ensure correct connections as per the specified color coding. 

**WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED.** The wiring should follow these color codes: green/yellow for earth, brown for live, and blue for neutral. If using a B.S. (British Standard) fused connection, ensure it meets the specifications required in the United States and adjust accordingly for other countries. 

The wires should be routed conveniently and should not interfere with vehicle dynamics, specifically regarding polarity. To ensure proper operation, connect the system to a rated A current from the battery through a relay that activates with the vehicle.

For satisfactory function, lights should be connected directly to the battery or battery charger. If bulb replacement is necessary, remove the cover by sliding it backward. The technical specifications include:
- RM Technical Data
- RM Height without Recess
- Capacity of cooling food from 25°C to ISO standard without LP cooling adjustments.
