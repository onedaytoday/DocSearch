### Clearance Height

The cooker must adhere to the specified clearance height indicated in the technical guidelines. Please follow the installation instructions accurately. When installing the cooker—whether built-in or standalone—the required clearance height must be observed.

### Installing the Cooker Hood

The cooker hood must be mounted to the wall at an appropriate height. This ensures optimal performance and efficient heat removal, especially when high-performance cooking is involved. The installation can accommodate ducting or recycling modes, depending on the configuration (with charcoal filters included).

To proceed with the installation, refer to the indicated height from the supplied section. Utilize the screws provided for securing the cooker hood and ensure that they penetrate the surface effectively. If working with hollow or porous surfaces, it may be necessary to use wall anchors.

### Air Extraction

The cooker hood operates most effectively when ducted directly outside or alternatively, recirculated with charcoal filters. Ensure compliance with relevant standards, such as British Standard or DIN 4102-B1, for safe operation.

When ducting, keep the pathway as straight and short as possible to maintain performance. Avoid any unnecessary bends, as these can hinder airflow efficiency. Should the ducting length exceed specifications, performance may experience a decline.

### Electrical Connection and Chimney Installation

Refer to the section titled "Electrical Connection" for proper wiring guidelines. The chimney is designed for optimal alignment with the outlet and should be positioned slightly to facilitate this. Use the provided screws for securing the chimney to the appropriate sections as demonstrated in the installation guide. 

For any complications or specific configurations, follow the guidance to ensure proper assembly and functionality.
