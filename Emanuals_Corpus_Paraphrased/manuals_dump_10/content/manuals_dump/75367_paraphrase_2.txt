The current status will be displayed, and you can cancel anytime.

**Safety Precautions**

It’s crucial to monitor cooking to prevent foodborne illness. Should a fire occur, do not attempt to extinguish it with water—use a fire extinguisher instead. 

**Broiling and Cooking Techniques**

Broiling employs high heat (300°F to 550°F) to cook meat, creating a browned exterior. For best results, preheat the oven and ensure food is not covered to prevent grease fires. 

**Convection Baking**

Convection baking enhances cooking efficiency by circulating heat evenly at temperatures ranging from 170°F to 550°F. Preheating is advised, and adjustments may be necessary for various types of food to achieve optimal results. 

**Convection Convert**

Utilizing the Convection Convert feature adjusts standard recipes to suit convection cooking, optimizing cooking times and temperatures by reducing them by 25°F compared to conventional methods.

**Rapid Preheat and Convection Roasting**

Rapid Preheat ensures quick heating for efficient cooking. Convection roasting also provides an even heat distribution for meats and similar items, enhancing flavor and texture.

**Keep Warm Setting**

The Keep Warm function maintains food at temperatures between 150°F and 190°F to preserve warmth after cooking.

**Slow Cook Functionality**

The Slow Cook setting allows for gradual cooking of various dishes. It features two temperature settings (HI/LO) with recommended times to prevent burning. Make sure to thaw foods beforehand for better cooking results.

**Dehydrating Function**

This function circulates heat at lower temperatures (100°F to 225°F) to dry foods effectively. To utilize this setting, preheat the oven and monitor the process carefully.

**Defrosting Function**

Defrosting allows for the gentle thawing of frozen items without cooking them, applying ambient heat to ensure proper thawing. Be sure to follow USDA guidelines for safe thawing practices.

Certainly! Here's a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

**BREAD PROOFING** involves activating the yeast within the dough. Ideal proofing temperatures range from 85°F to 100°F, with a target of 100°F. **Proofing Tips**: Preheat the proofing chamber using the lowest setting to warm the cavity. Allow sufficient time for the temperature to stabilize and for the dough to rise. To initiate proofing, press the OVEN button to activate the heating element, then select BREAD PROOF and press START. If you need to pause the function, press CANCEL. During activation, you can maintain function by pressing the OVEN button to continue heating. Use the HI or LO settings as necessary, and press START to resume proofing.

**PERFECT TURKEY** features precise cooking capabilities for poultry. The cooking range is from 170°F to 550°F, with an optimal cooking temperature around 325°F and a target internal temperature of 180°F. **Perfect Tips**: Thaw the turkey completely before cooking and preheat the oven. Utilize the roasting pan with grease catch features for optimal results. Ensure the turkey is securely positioned in the oven for even cooking and effective heat circulation. To use the Perfect Turkey function, press the OVEN button, then select PERFECT TURKEY, and press START. Optionally, you can use the PROBE feature for precise temperature monitoring.

**TEMPERATURE PROBE** is essential for checking the internal temperature of meats and poultry, ensuring proper cooking without guesswork. The probe functions optimally in convection mode, with operating temperatures from 130°F to 210°F, settling around 170°F. **IMPORTANT**: Always ensure food is completely thawed before insertion and test at the thickest points away from bones. Cooking times will vary based on the meat's thickness. The internal probe outlet is located at the top front of the oven cavity. To activate, press the OVEN button, then access COOK OPTIONS and PROBE, and press START once the target internal temperature is reached. For any adjustments, utilize the KEEP WARM feature or CANCEL as needed.

**MULTI STAGE** cooking allows for up to three distinct cooking methods, including Convection and proofing sequences. Initiate by selecting the desired mode and pressing START. Options include Convection Bake and Broil. For each stage, follow the prompts to execute the corresponding cooking method. To manage or cancel an ongoing process, simply press CANCEL.

**USER PREFERENCES** provides customizable settings for the oven, including time display options (12-hour or no clock). To access user preferences, select USER PREF and navigate through options using the buttons. You can set the clock format and temperature units (Fahrenheit or Celsius) per your preferences.

**ADJUSTING OVEN TEMPERATURE**: Should you find the oven temperature inconsistent, calibrate it within a range of +/- 35°F from the factory settings. Use USER PREFERENCES to adjust this accordingly.

**MY FAVORITES** offers quick access to frequently used cooking settings and times, which can be saved and recalled easily. To save or overwrite a favorite, press MY FAVORITE and follow the prompts.

**SABBATH FEATURE** allows for uninterrupted cooking during Jewish Sabbath holidays, operating solely in BAKE mode. Once activated, the oven remains on continuously, with no additional functions accessible except for starting and stopping. To activate, press OVEN, select BAKE, and set the time, ensuring the ambient light settings are correctly adjusted to comply with Sabbath regulations. For any interruptions or light settings, use the appropriate controls to manage function.

This version retains the original meaning while presenting the information more clearly and concisely in a technical context.

**SABBATH FEATURE (CONT'D)** 

To activate the Sabbath feature, initially press the BAKE button to select either HI or LO, then press START twice. To turn off the feature, press OFF or CANCEL, which will disable the function. Wait at least five seconds before reactivating HI or LO. The oven will automatically return to the preset state. The SF will display during the Sabbath mode while the food continues to cook; however, it cannot be turned off. 

**USING THE SELF-CLEAN FEATURE**

Before self-cleaning, let the oven cool. Ensure you wear protective gloves when manually cleaning, and do not let children operate the self-cleaning function. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or chemicals that may damage the self-cleaning surface. Grease buildup should be addressed carefully, and if necessary, use a damp cloth or sponge. Remove any foil or container that could catch fire at high temperatures. Use caution since the oven interior will reach high temperatures during cleaning.

**STARTING THE SELF-CLEANING CYCLE**

To initiate the self-cleaning process, close the oven door and press the OVEN and CLEAN buttons. Select the desired cleaning duration—LIGHT, MEDIUM, or HEAVY—then press START. The DOOR light will flash, and once the cycle starts, allow it to run for approximately one hour. If you need to stop the self-cleaning, press CANCEL. After cooling, the DOOR indicator will illuminate, signaling that it's safe to open. 

**GENERAL CLEANING**

Ensure the oven is OFF and COOL before cleaning. Address spills and heavy soil immediately to minimize major cleaning later. Maintain painted surfaces, decorative finishes, and racks using a non-scratch cleaner and soft cloth. Regular cleaning will help keep the oven in good condition. If accumulations are found, they can be cleaned with warm water and a cloth. 

**CLEANING THE HINGE SLOT**

Refer to the specific cleaning section for care instructions regarding the stainless steel and the oven door. 

**OVEN LIGHT OPERATION**

The oven light activates when the door is closed using the integrated switch. Ensure the glass shield is in place whenever the oven is operational. To clean the shield, ensure the oven is cool, and use care to avoid burns.

**BROILER PAN CLEANING TIPS**

Avoid covering the broiler pan while cooking to prevent excessive grease buildup. Clean immediately after use to prevent the grease from hardening.

**COMMON ISSUES**

During cooking, pre-heat the oven sufficiently, and avoid overcrowding to ensure even cooking. Follow the specific temperature guidelines to prevent warping. In case of operational issues, consult the manual or an authorized service provider for assistance. 

**SELF-CLEANING CYCLE TROUBLESHOOTING**

If the self-cleaning cycle fails, ensure the oven door is correctly closed. Excessive smoke during broiling may suggest improper positioning or grease buildup. Regular maintenance and addressing cleaning concerns will help maintain optimal performance.
