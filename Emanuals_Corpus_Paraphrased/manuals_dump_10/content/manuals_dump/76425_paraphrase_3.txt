Certainly! Here’s a more concise and technical paraphrase of the original text, while retaining the core meaning:

To effectively clean stubborn stains, items can be pre-treated overnight with a cloth and appropriate cleaning agents. When dealing with mold, use bleach specifically for whites and colored fabrics, applied lightly. Stains from lipstick can also be treated with bleach. The cleaning process should begin by selecting the appropriate type of fabric and adjusting the washing settings according to their specific care requirements, ideally at 60°C. 

Additives can be incorporated for enhanced cleaning, and instructions should be followed closely to optimize washing performance. Water quality must also be considered, drawing from reliable sources or authorities. 

For effective stain removal, options such as prewashing and utilizing various temperature settings (from cold to 95°C) are recommended. Regular maintenance of the washing machine, including cleaning filters and ensuring drainage systems are clear, is essential for optimal performance. 

Emergency emptying procedures should be understood in case of clogs, and the machine should be unplugged from the electrical supply before any maintenance. Service issues should be addressed promptly, following specified trouble-shooting guidelines, and using the correct cleaning cycles for different fabric types, including synthetics and wool. 

The positioning of hoses must also adhere to regulations, ensuring they are not obstructed to maintain proper water flow. Compliance with local installation codes is crucial, particularly for permanent plumbing setups. Avoid connecting laundry appliances to incorrectly treated wastewater systems to prevent breakdowns.
