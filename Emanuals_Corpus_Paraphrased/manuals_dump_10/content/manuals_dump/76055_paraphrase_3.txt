### OWNER'S GUIDE

**IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS**

To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Turn off the appliance and disconnect it from the power source when not in use or during maintenance.
- Avoid using the appliance as a toy.
- Use only recommended attachments.
- Keep the cord clear from heated surfaces or sharp edges.
- Do not carry the unit by the cord, and maintain it free from any damage. 
- Allow the unit to cool down before cleaning or servicing, particularly after it has been in operation. 
- Ensure the appliance is turned off during any repairs.

**SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOUSEHOLD USE ONLY**

To reduce electrical shock, avoid using a power outlet other than the one recommended. If the appliance overheats, this is often due to an obstruction. In such cases, switch the unit off and allow it to cool. 

Be sure to read all instructions before operating the vacuum cleaner.

### UNPACKING AND CHECKING CONTENTS

Carefully unpack the components and accessories from the box. Ensure that all items are accounted for:

- Hose release 
- Suction control 
- Additional tools

**CAUTION:** Ensure to read the instructions prior to assembly.

### GETTING THE BEST RESULTS

**CAUTION:** Ensure the suction is set appropriately for cleaning various surface types. Adjust height settings as needed when using different attachments.

### REPLACING THE DUST BAG, FILTERS, AND BELTS

**CAUTION:** Only service the vacuum cleaner at authorized service centers. Replace the dust bag or filters when the indicator shows red. Check for obstructions that may hinder operation. 

When replacing components, make sure to follow the instructions closely to ensure proper installation.

### CLEANING THE HOSE

If the hose gets clogged or dirty, disconnect it and allow it to cool before attempting to clear any blockages. Regular maintenance of the hose is crucial for optimal performance. 

**IMPORTANT:** The warranty does not cover damages caused by improper cleaning of the hose.
