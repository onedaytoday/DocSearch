Sure! Here's a paraphrased version of the text:

**Washing Instructions for Various Fabrics**

For white and colored cotton items, use the "95-COLD" cycle. For synthetic or colored shirts, select "60-COLD EASY IRON PLUS." Handwash delicates using the "40-COLD" cycle, and if you choose the "WOOL PLUS HANDWASH" option, ensure the water temperature is set to 30Â°C or higher. When employing the "SUPER QUICK" function, note that cleaning effectiveness may diminish slightly. Other options including SPIN, RINSE HOLD, PREWASH, STAIN, SENSITIVE, TIME, and EXTRA RINSE can be selected depending on your needs.

**Sorting Instructions**

Sort clothes by colors: whites, coloreds, synthetics, and normal items. Wash whites and colors separately to maintain color integrity. It's best to wash new colored items alone first to avoid color bleed. Treat stains on different fabrics as needed, and for stubborn stains, consider soaking overnight or using bleach (for whites and colors).

**General Maintenance**

Ensure proper cleaning by disconnecting the machine from power before maintenance. Always clean filters regularly to avoid blockages. Use the appropriate settings for cleaning based on fabric type and avoid overloading the machine for optimal performance.

**Emergency Procedures**

In case of an emergency, follow the outlined procedures for safe operation. If you encounter an error indicated by blinking lights or sounds, consult the troubleshooting section for guidance.

**Water Supply Guidelines**

Ensure proper water supply connections and monitor for any leaks. The appliance's efficiency depends on correct positioning and adherence to installation instructions.

By observing these guidelines, you'll maintain your washing machine's efficiency and ensure your laundry is properly cleaned while extending the machine's life.
