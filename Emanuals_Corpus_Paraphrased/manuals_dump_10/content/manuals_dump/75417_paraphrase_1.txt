### Operating Instructions

**General Information**

- This unit is designed for various types of dumplings and has a specified trough capacity. It is equipped with a cover for the trough, which features rounded corners to facilitate easy cleaning. Recommended container sizes are GN or GN round.

**Operational Steps**

1. **Powering On**
   - Activate the main power switch and turn on the water supply to the trough. There are separate heating controls for the trough. Adjust the temperature settings as needed.

2. **Igniting the Pilot Burner**
   - Turn the knob counterclockwise to the ignition position. After ensuring the area is clear, press down gently and then rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise to ignite. The igniter should typically light within seconds. If the pilot flame goes out, repeat the ignition process.

3. **Igniting the Main Burner**
   - Gently press the knob and turn it counterclockwise to the high setting. Adjust to the desired heat output as indicated on the thermal rating scale.

4. **Temperature Control**
   - To increase temperature, rotate the knob clockwise; for lower settings, turn it counterclockwise. Ensure the trough is not operated below the specified temperature to maintain quality.

5. **Turning Off the Main Burner**
   - Rotate the control knob back to the off position. This will deactivate the gas supply to the burner.

6. **Extinguishing the Pilot Burner**
   - Press the knob gently and turn it clockwise to the off position until the flame is extinguished.

7. **Water Drainage**
   - To drain the trough, turn the valve counterclockwise and allow water to flow out.

**Long Shutdown Procedures:**
- For shutdowns exceeding 32°F (0°C), turn off the gas supply and disconnect the main bottle. Clean and cover the unit to prevent buildup, and ensure it’s maintained regularly.

**Cleaning Protocol:**
- Always allow the unit to cool before cleaning. The trough should be washed at least once daily, including strainer and outlet cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning agents and avoid high-pressure methods that could damage surfaces. After cleaning, ensure all components are dry before reassembling.

**Troubleshooting and Malfunctions:**
- In cases of overheating or irregular flame behavior, consult the troubleshooting section for common issues, such as:
  - Pilot light goes out
  - Flashes back
  - Inadequate heating
  - Dirt on the thermo-element

If issues persist, contact Customer Service for assistance.

**Installation and Safety Instructions:**
