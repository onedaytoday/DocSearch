Once initiated, the DOOR light will flash until the process is complete.

### GENERAL CLEANING

Ensure the oven is turned off and fully cooled before cleaning. Address any spills or heavy soil immediately to reduce the need for deep cleaning later. Regular maintenance is advised for the painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces. Use a sponge or cloth with a suitable cleaner, avoiding abrasive materials to preserve the surface finish. 

### CARE AND CLEANING OF STAINLESS STEEL

Refer to the designated cleaning section for stainless steel surfaces to maintain their appearance. When removing or replacing the oven door, locate the hinges at the front. Follow instructions closely to prevent damage.

### OVEN LIGHT

The oven light is activated by the switch located on the control panel. Always have the glass shield in place when the oven is operational. Make sure the oven is cool before attempting any maintenance on the light shield.
