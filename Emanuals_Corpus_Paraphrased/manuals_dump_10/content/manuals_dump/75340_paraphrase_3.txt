### Cooking Operations

**Cooking Overview**  
Cooking involves preparing food by applying heat. Preheating is essential for achieving the recommended cooking temperature. Foods should be preheated prior to being placed in the oven to ensure proper cooking times and temperatures are met. Always adhere to the cooking chart for guidance, and adjust temperatures by reducing them by approximately 20°C to 25°C when using a batch cooking method.

**Batch Cooking**  
During batch cooking, the function of the appliance should match the type of food being prepared. The appliance indicates its status with a light that turns on and off accordingly to indicate cooking progress. For more delicate items, like cakes, ensure the preheating is correctly configured before cooking.

**Cooking Charts**  
Cooking charts provide guidance on cook times and temperatures based on the type of food. For instance:

- **Grilling Times**  
  - Rashers, Chops, Whole Trout/Mackerel, and Plaice/Cod have specific cooking times based on thickness.  
- **Top Cooking Chart**  
  - Various items like Meringues, Shortbread, and Yorkshire Puddings have designated cooking positions and times.

**Roasting Guidelines**  
When roasting, maintain a temperature of 160-180°C, monitoring internal temperatures (50-80°C) to ensure proper doneness. Food items should be spaced adequately to allow for even cooking and browning. Using appropriate cookware can enhance browning and heat circulation.

**Defrosting Procedures**  
Defrosting should be done cautiously, allowing foods like meat to thaw slowly, or using the specified function for quicker results. Once defrosted, items must be cooked immediately to ensure food safety.

### Service Issues

**Troubleshooting**  
If problems arise, check the following:

1. **Cooling Issues**  
   Ensure the appliance has cooled down adequately post-use. Allow a few hours for it to stabilize.

2. **Cooking Evenness**  
   Check that appliances are being used correctly at designated shelf positions as per the instructions. 

3. **Cleaning Protocols**  
   Turn off the electricity supply before cleaning. Use non-abrasive cleaners suitable for the appliances’ surfaces, following manufacturer recommendations. Clean shelves and the cavity thoroughly to avoid buildup. If necessary, disassemble parts for deeper cleaning.

By following these guidelines, you can optimize your cooking efficiency and appliance longevity.
