### Paraphrased Instructions for Oven Use and Maintenance

The oven has a built-in feature that allows temperature settings from 170°F to 550°F (65°C to 287°C). To activate, turn the dial to the appropriate setting. If the function is selected, it will automatically turn off once the desired temperature is reached. 

To start, turn the dial and press the button to set the clock. For cooking meats or poultry, ensure they are properly thawed and not stored longer than an hour after cooking. Upon completion, promptly remove cooked items. 

The BAKE TIME and STOP TIME features work simultaneously to turn the oven off automatically. If needed, use a fire extinguisher to address any fires but do not attempt to extinguish flames with water. Ensure to season food and turn items as they cook. If a fire occurs, close the oven door and turn the oven off.

For self-cleaning, do not use cleaner formulas on the oven’s interior surfaces, and refrain from applying force during this process as the door locks automatically while cleaning. The oven will be very hot during self-cleaning, so allow it to cool before handling. Use protective gear when cleaning, especially with harsh chemicals, and avoid scouring pads or abrasive cleaners.

For cleaning the exterior and decorative surfaces, avoid heavy-duty products that could scratch. Use a damp cloth and appropriate cleaners that do not scratch the surfaces. Always ensure the oven is turned off and cooled before cleaning.

When cleaning other components, such as the top, lower it carefully and avoid using excessive force. Use only recommended cleaning tools and ensure all parts are seated correctly to avoid malfunctions.

For the light fixture, ensure the oven is off before attempting to clean or replace the bulb. Follow manufacturer instructions regarding the removal of protective shields and screws.

Always exercise caution when performing any maintenance tasks and ensure to follow these guidelines for a safe and effective cleaning experience. If any issues arise, ensure the oven is turned off and allow it to cool before addressing.

### Performance of Self-Cleaning Oven

To initiate self-cleaning, ensure you follow the factory settings. If the oven seems too hot or too cool, adjust it according to the recommended temperatures. To turn it OFF, do so within seconds and rotate the oven control clockwise to set it at either 35°F or 5°F from the desired temperature. The offset amount will be indicated by the lights: the "OVEN" light will flash alongside the "LOCK" light during the adjustment. If the "OVEN" light blinks, the offset is likely at 0°F. If it flashes three times, the offset is 15°F.

For optimal performance, regular maintenance is essential. The self-cleaning feature helps manage accumulated grease and food residues. Ensure that the oven is not overcrowded with cookware, as this can lead to uneven heating. Lightweight cookware may heat unevenly, while heavier items may not fit properly. Follow the instructions in the "Cleaning" section for best practices.
