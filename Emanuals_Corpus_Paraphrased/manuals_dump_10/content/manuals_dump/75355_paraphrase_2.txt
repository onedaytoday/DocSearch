Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and cooled down. For cleaning, use a damp cloth or leather to wipe surfaces. It's essential to clean thoroughly to prevent food burning during cooking. Specific components, such as the top cover, should be cleaned with cloths suitable for their surface.

When disassembling for internal cleaning, securely retain any locking mechanisms to prevent accidental release. Ensure any internal parts are reassembled correctly, with the appropriate surfaces facing outward. Check for any scratches or cracks; if found, seek assistance from authorized service personnel. Always use recommended cleaning agents that won't damage heat-reflective surfaces.

**Cleaning Shelves and Supports**

Use a damp cloth to clean shelves. To detach the shelves, unscrew the front while holding the back in place. Ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply to avoid electric shock during cleaning.

For replacement parts, adhere to specified ratings, such as a maximum wattage of 300W for E14-type bulbs, and ensure the power supply is disconnected before undertaking any replacements.

If the interior light malfunctions or dishes are cooking incorrectly, check the wiring and switch positions. Adjust the thermostat between 50°C and 250°C to ensure optimal cooking. Refer to the troubleshooting section for further instructions.
