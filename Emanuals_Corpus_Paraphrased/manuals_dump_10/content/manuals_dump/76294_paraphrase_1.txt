The hose is intended to be connected using threading and is already compatible with other hoses. Regarding the AL013 model, the hose has been extended. If the length is excessive, it may be necessary to acquire a specific type of hose (P0021) or use an alternative option. The design allows the hose to connect effectively to ensure proper functionality.

IMPORTANT: The hose should be fitted to the maximum recommended pressure (indicated on the label) to avoid twisting. If the hose becomes misaligned, it may affect performance. Once the correct configuration is established, monitor the operation closely. If there is an issue with code P0254, refer to the rating specified on the plate, as it defines the acceptable working parameters for the setup. Ensure there is no reduction in efficiency or safety measures between the inlet and outlet connections.

For earthing safety, ensure that all outlets are properly grounded. This is crucial when using outdoor equipment such as cleaners, chainsaws, and mowers, which may be subject to varying standards across different countries. It's essential to select cleaning products based on their compatibility and safety regulations.
