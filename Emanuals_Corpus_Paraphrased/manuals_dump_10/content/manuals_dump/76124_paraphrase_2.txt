#### Important Safety Information

Ensure that the chimney hood is installed in compliance with relevant regulations, including BS.6172, BS.5440, BS.6891, and BS.5482. Always maintain a safe clearance height to prevent overheating. If the unit overheats, switch it off immediately and allow it to cool down before further use.

Adjust the settings based on your cooking needs. Regularly clean the grease filter, ideally every month or after extensive use, using appropriate cleaning methods like hand washing or dishwasher cleaning.
