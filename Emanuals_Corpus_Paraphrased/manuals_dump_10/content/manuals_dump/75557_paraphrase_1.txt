**Instructions for Oven Use and Maintenance**

**Shelf Setup**  
Ensure the shelves are installed safely, with at least four layers of cake evenly distributed. If you have multiple layers, avoid placing one directly above another to prevent heat blockage. Use the designated shelf positions (A through F) for optimal cooking results, ensuring they are correctly locked in place.

**Preheating Guidelines**  
Preheat the oven by selecting the "BAKE" option and pressing the "START/ON" button. The oven will automatically preheat to the desired temperature, indicated on the display. This step is important for baking items like cakes, cookies, and bread. If the shelves are positioned too low (A), heat may not circulate properly, potentially causing burns. It’s crucial to closely monitor the oven while baking to avoid any accidents.

**Cooking Time and Timer**  
For precise cooking, utilize the kitchen timer feature. To activate it, select the "KITCHEN TIMER ON/OFF" button. If adjustments are needed, simply touch the corresponding buttons until the desired time is displayed. Note that the timer functions independently from the cooking countdown.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**  
The oven includes a self-cleaning feature, which should be activated only after removing all cookware. Once the cleaning cycle is complete, use the "CLEAR/OFF" button to reset the oven. Be mindful of safety as the self-cleaning process generates considerable heat.

**Thermostat Adjustments**  
If you suspect inaccuracies in cooking temperatures, you can calibrate the thermostat. Use calibrated thermometers available in stores for comparison. If the oven is consistently too hot or cold, adjustments can be made according to your preference.

**Additional Features**  
The oven also features a Sabbath mode, which allows you to use it while observing certain dietary practices. The oven light will illuminate when the door is closed and can be controlled via the switch. Always refer to the manual for specific instructions regarding features and settings.

**Self-Cleaning Instructions for GE Appliances**

To engage the self-cleaning feature, visit www.GEAppliances.com. This feature is designed to clean heavy-duty cookware and shelves. **Note:** Ensure that shelves can withstand the self-clean cycle, as manual cleaning may still be necessary for some items. Use non-abrasive cleaners for any manual cleaning required. 

**Important:** Confirm that the door latch is functioning properly before starting. Allow the oven to cool down if necessary. To initiate cleaning, touch the SELF CLEAN button or START/ON, and the cleaning duration will display, typically ranging from 2 to 4 hours based on selected settings. Once the cycle begins, a countdown timer will appear.

The oven components are designed to endure the cleaning process. If any interior parts show signs of wear, replace them prior to starting the self-cleaning function to avoid injury. During the cleaning cycle, the clock will reflect the cleaning time remaining.

To stop the self-clean cycle, press CLEAR/OFF. Ensure that the oven has cooled sufficiently to disengage the lock. Use a soft cloth with a mild detergent to clean any residue, particularly on cooling shelves or painted surfaces.

**Safety Note:** Always follow safety instructions during the process. For additional cleaning tips and troubleshooting, refer to the GE Appliances website. Ensure that all parts, including the light covers, are properly seated and secured after cleaning.

For any further issues or questions, consult the troubleshooting section on the website. Perform routine checks and maintenance to keep your appliance in optimal working condition. If you encounter problems, refer to the relevant sections for quick resolutions.
