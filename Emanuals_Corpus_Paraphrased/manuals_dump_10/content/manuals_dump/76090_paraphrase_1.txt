### How to Maintain Your Device

To ensure safe operation, always turn off the On/Off switch before performing maintenance. Regularly clean the brushroll to prevent injury from touching it or the threads. First, power down the device and disconnect it from the ground. Remove the screws, and adjust the brushroll accordingly. When reassembling, make sure to position everything back in its place and secure the screws, particularly at the rear.

**Caution**: Always switch off the device before servicing. Check the thermal indicator and ensure the hose is free from clogs, which may affect suction and cleaning performance. If there is a reduction in suction, clear any blockages from the hose and brushroll. Adjust the height settings as necessary to maintain effectiveness.

For issues like reduced suction or clogs, ensure that the hose and brushroll are clean and in good condition. If you face any challenges that persist, consider consulting with customer service or reviewing your purchase details, as issues may be covered under warranty.
