### Troubleshooting Guide for ELSA ECOMO 22H99

**Identifying LED Issues**  
Check if the LED is switched on. If you encounter the message "ATTENTION: NO SIGNAL," it may indicate signal loss. If "ATTENTION: SIGNAL FREQUENCY IS OUT OF RANGE" appears, verify that the video level isn't too bright or dim. Ensure the USB hub is properly connected and functioning. Confirm that the AC power is not disconnected and the BNC connections are secure. Additionally, verify if the switch function is activated.

**Resetting Display Settings**  
If adjustments are necessary, utilize the "GEOMETRY RESET" or "ALL RESET" options to recalibrate parameters such as H-SIZE, V-SIZE, H-PHASE, and V-POSITION to fit the full screen. If refreshing doesn’t resolve, check the USB connections and ensure they are intact.

**Restraint Wires in CRT**  
The thin wires inside the CRT serve as restraints, reducing vibrations. If there’s a phenomenon linked to these wires, further analysis may be required.
