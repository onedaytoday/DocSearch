3. Allow adequate space for maintenance when connecting.

### Installation Requirements

- If using models like EIMP60, verify compliance with UL specifications and ensure the power source is appropriate.
- Maintain proper temperature conditions for optimal operation (50°F to 110°F or 10°C to 43°C) and avoid direct sunlight.

### Built-In or Free-Standing Installation

For a built-in installation, ensure the unit is free from obstructions and has adequate clearance. The unit may require a few hours to cool properly before first use. Follow initial setup instructions carefully, including grounding the power supply.

**Water Assembly and Cube Thickness Processing**

The water continuously flows through the assembly into the trough, affecting its thickness. This process is repeated until the water reaches the desired level at the top. Various cleanliness factors are monitored during operation, which involves audible indicators. Adjustments to the cube thickness can be made depending on the technological variations that are mounted vertically. 

**Cube Thickness Specifications:**
Cubes can vary depending on the batches or within a batch. The process ensures that the cube's thickness aligns with factory performance metrics, which can be approximately standardized. A thicker cube leads to improved performance as the thickness increases.

**Cube Variants:** 
- **Good Ice (Ice001)**: Meets ideal thickness standards.
- **Poor Ice (Ice002)**: Varies in thickness, indicating poor quality.

To adjust the cube thickness, use the UP and DOWN arrows on the control panel. Follow the prompts to select the desired thickness and allow adequate time between adjustments for optimal results. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance Considerations:**
Maintain the system by cleaning regularly, ideally every three months. Avoid using steel wool or non-stainless steel cleaners. Cleaners that contain bleach or abrasive substances can damage the equipment and void the warranty. Monthly cleaning with appropriate stainless steel polish is recommended to maintain performance and lifespan.

**Annual Maintenance:**
Inspect water supply hoses and connections at least once a year to ensure they are secure and free from blockages. Disconnect the system when necessary for thorough cleaning. Monitor ambient temperatures carefully, especially if they drop below 45°F (7°C), as this could affect performance and warranty coverage.

**Troubleshooting:**
If issues arise, check common malfunctions first, ensuring that the unit is adequately powered and there are no obstructions in water flow. Familiarize yourself with error codes such as E1 or E2, and consult the user manual or your service provider as needed to rectify any faults. 

For any persistent issues, document model numbers and service details for efficient assistance from customer support.
