### Storage Guidelines for Food and Appliances

To optimize food storage, place items in bottles or containers on the lowest shelf. This area is cooler than higher shelves, where temperatures rise. Ensure that food items are properly packaged or covered to prevent contamination from other foods. Airtight containers and wraps are recommended for effective storage.

To preserve the freshness of food, allow it to cool before storage. Rapid cooling is essential to minimize bacterial growth. Utilize the FROSTMATIC function for quick freezingâ€”this setting allows for optimal freezing of stored foods, which can stay fresh for longer. Once activated, the FROSTMATIC function will automatically turn off after a set duration. If needed, this function can be switched on manually.

### Defrosting Techniques

To defrost items, use the defrost feature while avoiding impacts on food quality. Always clean the unit as outlined in the "Cleaning and Defrosting" section, being cautious to prevent frost buildup. Regular maintenance is necessary to ensure efficiency.
