**Assembly Instructions**: 
When assembling the equipment, use the provided M5 self-locking screws. Ensure proper placement of washers and mount them correctly to the housing and components. The cutting height can be adjusted centrally according to your needs.

**Operational Guidelines**: 
Before starting the machine, verify that the clutch is disengaged and the throttle is adjusted correctly. The light indicator will alert you to necessary adjustments or malfunctions. Use only SAE certified oil (SE, SF, or SG) for maintenance. 

**Maintenance**: 
Regularly clean and check for any leaks or malfunctions. Monitor the condition of the battery and perform necessary maintenance at the start of each operating season. Always operate the equipment with proper protective gear and precautions in place. 

Failure to adhere to these guidelines can lead to injuries. Ensure that the machine is stored safely and is free from obstructions when not in use. If repairs or servicing are needed, contact authorized service personnel only.

To ensure safe operation when cleaning, always allow the equipment to cool down before proceeding. Wear protective gear during cleaning or maintenance tasks to prevent fire hazards due to heat or flammable materials. If issues arise, such as the cover sticking, make sure to clean it thoroughly and check for any components that may need adjustment, such as incorrect height settings or excessive weight being conveyed.

For troubleshooting, if the clutch is malfunctioning or if there are problems with the cabling, refer to the Service Workshop for guidance. Additionally, ensure that the throttle is properly set, ideally at MAX if necessary, and that all connections are secure. If cleaning alone does not resolve the issue, consult the Service Workshop for further assistance and correction.

Always remember to consult your Service Dealer for advice specific to your equipment and never attempt repairs without proper authorization and instructions from the Service Workshop.
