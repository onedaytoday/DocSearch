# SIG and Instructions

## Introduction
This guide aligns with the British Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It is essential to read this thoroughly before using the equipment to ensure it operates effectively for cooking food. The provided instructions detail the correct usage and safety measures to follow. If any guidance has previously been neglected, it’s vital to review these instructions again.

### Rating Plate
The rating plate is located at the front or top of the cavity, or it may be found at the back. This includes vital information regarding the appliance specifications, which should always be adhered to.

## Lighting the Hotplate
To ignite the hotplate, turn the control to the maximum setting and hold it until the flame is established. Immediate action is crucial in case the flame goes out. A release switch is present for safety; ensure to follow these instructions carefully to avoid potential fire hazards.

### Cooking Guidelines
Utilize the cooking chart for optimal temperature settings based on the food type. Regularly check on cooking progress and adjust heat as necessary to ensure food is cooked evenly. This includes preheating when required, particularly for items that demand specific temperatures.

#### Heat Management
Adjust the heat dial from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then to 'LOW' when necessary. Understanding the heat distribution—especially for thicker food items versus those needing high heat—will improve cooking results.

### Shelf Arrangement
Different food thicknesses can influence cooking time. Position food centrally on the shelf to promote even cooking. Pay attention to how close or far food items are from the heat source.

## Roasting Guidelines
When roasting, it is important to cover meats to trap heat and ensure thorough cooking. Be cautious of items becoming overly dry; manage exposure to heat by covering when necessary.

### Cooking Charts
Refer to the cooking chart for detailed settings and timing based on food types—this includes specific instructions for poultry and meats, along with appropriate cooking times to ensure thorough preparation.

## Timer Operation
To set the cooking timer, adjust the dial clockwise to the desired time, then switch it to 'Countdown.' The display will indicate the time remaining, ensuring accurate monitoring of your cooking schedule.

### Conclusion
Following these guidelines will enhance safety and effectiveness while using the appliance. For any queries regarding operation or specific functionalities, please refer to the instructional manual provided with the equipment.

### Paraphrased Text:

At the start of the timer, turn the clock's dial to set the desired time. As the timer countdown begins, switch on the appliance. To ensure everything is set correctly, follow the instructions below for guidance. The clock will display the electricity supply status along with the cooking time.

When preparing food, determine its cooking duration based on the chart provided. Once cooking is complete, ensure the operation is finished by turning off the device. It's essential to follow instructions closely, as improper handling may lead to issues. 

Perishable items should be consumed promptly and must be kept at safe temperatures. Fresh ingredients, particularly raw meat, should be stored correctly, and dishes containing meat need to be cooked thoroughly. Consult the cooking duration guidelines to choose ingredients properly, ensuring they are arranged without overcrowding for even cooking.

For soups and stews, begin by bringing ingredients to a boil before reducing the heat. Cover pots tightly to maintain heat. If needed, thickening agents like cornflour can be added to achieve desired consistency. Remember to cool and reheat food safely, following specific guidelines for efficient reheating without compromising quality.

Cleaning is crucial for safe operation; thus, maintain a clean cooking environment to avoid hazards or food contaminants. Refer to product cleaning instructions to prevent damage from cleaning agents that might tarnish surfaces.

When cleaning the hotplate, utilize suitable cleaning products while taking care not to damage any components. Ensure all surfaces are kept clean to enhance the appliance's longevity and maintain its aesthetic appeal.

Lastly, the positioning of the appliance is essential for safety. Follow the height and width guidelines to prevent accidents. Ensure all electrical connections are secure and use suitable circuit specifications to avoid overloads. If troubleshooting becomes necessary, consult a professional to address any issues safely. 

Overall, adherence to these guidelines ensures efficient use of appliances while maintaining safety and cleanliness in the kitchen.
