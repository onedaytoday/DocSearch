### OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE

**Turning On the Device**  
To begin, ensure the PC or device is connected. Turn on the device using the ON switch. Access the On-Screen Display (OSD) as illustrated. Navigate to the [Graphics] section for further selections. Adjust the brightness settings using the [BRIGHTNESS] buttons as outlined in the OSD instructions on page 39.

**3-D Shooting Procedure**  
For 3-D shooting, engage the ON/OFF switch and refer to the head orientation. Ensure the appropriate settings are applied through the OSD (see page 36 for AF selections). Adjust brightness as needed using the same [BRIGHTNESS] controls.

**Shooting Technique**  
To capture images while rotating the head horizontally, access the rotation settings via the OSD. Confirm successful adjustments by monitoring the displayed graphics. Turn off the light when not in use.

### VARIOUS FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS

**Adjustable Settings**  
The device allows for various adjustments, including brightness enhancement and zoom ratio settings. Press the [AF] button once focused, allowing for smooth operation. This is especially useful for reflections against bright backgrounds or fast-moving subjects. Consult the SD guidance for detailed operations.

**Light Settings and Performance**  
To toggle the light, use the ON/OFF switch. The high-brightness LED enhances performance while the switch is active. Adjust brightness directly through the OSD for optimal visibility.

**Factory Reset Options**  
To restore factory settings, navigate to the factory brightness settings via the OSD. Adjustments can return to the preset configurations by pressing the [BRIGHTNESS] buttons accordingly.

**Input Selection**  
While connected, priority can be given to either the RGB or SD input. Ensure the correct inputs are selected through the OSD for seamless operation.

**One-Push White Balance**  
For white balance adjustments, simply shoot a white reference and confirm via the [White One-Push] setting in the OSD. This will lock the white balance for subsequent images, ranging from 3000K to 8000K.
