**WARNING**: To mitigate the risks of fire, electric shock, or personal injury, please adhere to the following guidelines. This is essential if the warranty is to remain valid. Before any service or cleaning, ensure the appliance is powered off and securely locked in the "off" position. Follow safety warnings associated with service requirements and ensure compliance with fire and combustion safety regulations, including guidelines from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), as well as relevant authorities. 

To prevent fires specifically from range top grease: 
A. Heat should be regulated as high and greasy conditions can occur.  
B. Turn off when cooking at high temperatures or when food starts to burn.  
C. Regular cleaning is essential; grease buildup should not be permitted.  

**WARNING**: To prevent injury during a range top grease fire:
* Smother flames with a suitable lid or, if necessary, shut off the heat.
* Exercise caution to avoid burns.
* If flames persist, evacuate immediately and contact the fire department.
* Never attempt to pick up a flaming pan, as this may result in burns.
* Do not use water or dishcloths.
* Utilize a Class ABC fire extinguisher only if you:
   A. Are familiar with its proper use.
   B. Understand how the fire ignited.
   C. Have already alerted the authorities.
   D. Can fight the fire while maintaining a safe distance.

**CAUTION**: To minimize fire risks, ensure correct installation of ductwork and to utilize cleaning products as directed. Be aware of appliance overheat conditions and secure it after cooling. 

For optimal operation:
- The appliance is controlled via front push-buttons. 
- The light switch turns the light on and off. 
- The blower speed can be adjusted between low and high settings. 

**HALOGEN BULBS**: Use GU10, MR16 shielded, 120V, 50W bulbs. Always switch off the electricity before performing maintenance or bulb replacement.

**MAINTENANCE:** Regularly clean grease filters as indicated in the INSTALL FILTERS section. Non-ducted filters should be serviced every three months. Clean with non-abrasive household products and avoid using abrasive cleaners or tools.

**INSTALLATION**:
1. Unbox and prepare for installation.
2. Ensure ductwork is installed as per instructions; straighten bends to enhance performance.
3. Turn off power during installation.
4. Follow guidelines for mounting the bracket according to your kitchen's ceiling height.
5. Secure flue and duct connections carefully.

Refer to further installation instructions for detailed steps on connecting electrical components and ensuring a safe setup for ducted and non-ducted units.
