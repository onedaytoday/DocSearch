Whether installed as a free-standing unit or built-in, the compactor is designed for various configurations and can be shipped accordingly. It can be converted from built-in to free-standing using the Toe Accessory ETC15TKH, which must be purchased separately. If opting for free-standing installation, ensure that the Toe Accessory is properly integrated for optimal operation. 

For built-in setups, the mounting procedure should align with the countertop specifications, as indicated in the installation guidelines. Note that the mounting must accommodate the cabinetry. The height is critical for proper electrical outlet access, as detailed in the Grounding Instructions section. Ensure the power cord is not pinched beneath the unit during installation.

The compactor features four rollers located at the back, allowing for smooth movement and adjustment. Adjust the screws as necessary to achieve a proper fit, using a wood block for stabilization at the front. Ensure the leveling legs are correctly positioned to maintain balance and alignment for optimal performance.
