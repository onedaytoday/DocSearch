Here’s a paraphrased version of the provided text:

The technical specifications indicate the installation information and positioning ratings for internal components. The temperature ratings are as follows: SN +10°C to 32°C, ST +16°C to 38°C, and a maximum of +16°C to 43°C. It is important to ensure proper grounding. The wires are color-coded as follows: Earth (Brown), Neutral (Blue), and Live (Red). Ensure connections are made according to these color indications to prevent electrical hazards, including shocks or stray currents, from the outer sheath. 

For electricity supply, ensure the switch matches the specified ratings, as per ASTA (BS standards). Warning: Disconnect from the power supply to avoid serious electric shock during installation. If necessary, position the spacer as shown in the diagrams, and secure it tightly. 

Ensure that components move freely, and align them according to the arrow indicators provided on the cover. Make sure that the front cover is correctly installed, with appropriate clearance maintained. Secure the cover in place with screws, referring to the specified models (E, DX, SX, C, D, B) for correct alignment.

For lateral adjustments, tighten screws as needed. Document handling should prioritize environmental concerns; treat this product as household waste, properly recycling and disposing of it.
