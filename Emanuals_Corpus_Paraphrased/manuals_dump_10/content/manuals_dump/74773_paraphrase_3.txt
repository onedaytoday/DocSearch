**Appliance Functionality Overview**

The buttons on this appliance are linked to adjust settings between the CURRENT and DESIRED temperature displays, represented as (WARMER) and (COLDER). Pressing these buttons will change the temperature setting to the DESIRED level in Celsius (°C). If the CURRENT temperature setting is altered, it reverts back to display the ACTUAL conditions. The ACTUAL temperature is indicated by the displayed numbers.

When the FROSTMATIC or COOLMATIC functions are activated, notifications display the TEMP (°C) while these modes are operational. If either button is pressed, the appliance will provide feedback in the form of audible alerts or visual signals. For partially defrosted food items, a warning will indicate if the temperature surpasses the warmest level reached during cooling. If alert codes (F7 or F8) appear, this suggests an operational or functional issue requiring attention.

The ON/OFF button serves to manage appliance activity; when activated, it confirms the transition from standby while the actual and desired temperatures are displayed. When adjusting the temperature, the display will show the DESIRED temperature in flashing format for confirmation. It is crucial to adhere to the recommended temperature ranges to avoid any warning notifications.

The FROSTMATIC function is designed to preserve the freshness of food by entering a high-capacity cooling mode. This function can be terminated manually at any time, reverting back to normal operations. In instances where food temperature exceeds the designated levels, the operation will automatically switch to safeguard food quality.

The system includes safety measures to prevent unintended modifications, accessible via press-and-hold actions on the operational controls. Any anomalies in operation are indicated through warning lights or sounds, directing users to take corrective actions promptly.

Attention to these indicators is essential, particularly concerning food safety boundaries regarding temperature and storage conditions. The specific capacity ratings indicate the amount of fresh food that can be frozen effectively, and adherence to these guidelines is crucial for optimal performance. 

For best storage practices, it’s advised to use airtight packaging and segregate various food types to prevent cross-contamination, ensuring proper cooling efficiency.

Please consult the operational manual for detailed instructions on the FROSTMATIC function and cleaning processes to maintain appliance efficiency and longevity.

**Cleaning and Maintenance Procedure**

Regular cleaning of the interior is essential for optimal performance. **Caution:** Before cleaning, always ensure the appliance is switched off to prevent electrical shock. Disconnect the power via the cleaning switch, or unplug the unit before engaging in any cleaning activities.

The automatic defrosting feature may operate during maintenance. **Note:** Avoid using ethereal or butyric cleaners, which could damage the surface. For intensive cleaning, activate the FROSTMATIC function for approximately two hours, cover sensitive items with newspaper, and then switch the appliance off by holding the ON/OFF button for a few seconds. Wipe surfaces with a clean cloth.

It is crucial to clean the back of the appliance periodically to prevent overheating. Wait for food to cool before storing to avoid unnecessary warmth. Clean the back thoroughly as necessary.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**

Follow these instructions for addressing potential malfunctions. **Warning:** Only qualified professionals should conduct repairs. If the appliance displays warning codes (e.g., C, F7, F8), or indicative sounds, refer to the troubleshooting section to rectify issues.

For a Partial/Complete Thaw Warning, check if food items are appropriately sealed to avoid unnecessary thawing. If temperatures exceed safe limits, inform the service department. 

If the appliance's cooling function fails, pressing the FROSTMATIC button may help restore operations. 

**Electrical Safety Notice**

For your safety, always adhere to electrical specifications (e.g., Voltage: V, Power: W). Ensure the light switch is off when not in use to avoid electrical hazards. 

**Regulatory Compliance**

This appliance complies with relevant household and safety directives (GSG, VBG, VDE) in accordance with EU regulations (73/23/EWG, 89/336/EWG, including 92/31/EWG).
