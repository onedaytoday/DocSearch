### Periodic Maintenance
Refer to the figures for guidance on securing the screws located at the top of the base and around the pulley. Ensure these components are tightly fastened to maintain proper functionality. It is essential to rotate the cleaner upright before proceeding with any adjustments.

### Problem Solving
**Caution:** Ensure the switch is turned off before troubleshooting the hose. Disconnect the hose from its coupling as shown in the provided figures. Inspect the hose for any obstructions; if any are found, clear them to restore proper flow. If the hose is blocked, check the connections and ensure any debris is removed.

If suction is inadequate, turn off the unit and check for clogs that may hinder airflow through the hose, as these can reduce efficiency. Clear any restrictions and check if the hose is properly positioned both at the back and the front of the cleaner.
