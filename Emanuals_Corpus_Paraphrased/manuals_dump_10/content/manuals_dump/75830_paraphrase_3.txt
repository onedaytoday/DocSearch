This document provides essential information, guidance, and safety hints for users to ensure the effective operation of the product. It emphasizes the importance of adherence to the included instructions for safe usage, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as children or those with limited physical capabilities. Safety measures should be followed to avoid risks such as suffocation, electric shock, or fire hazards.

Users should unplug the appliance during cleaning and avoid leaving it in direct sunlight or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. It's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions meticulously, including proper defrosting and cleaning protocols.

**Warnings include:**
- Ensure no obstructions are present to prevent overheating or short-circuits.
- Use only authorized service technicians for repairs.
- Regularly clean the appliance and avoid using harsh chemicals that may damage its surfaces.
- Store food properly to maintain freshness and prevent contamination.

The appliance should be allowed to stabilize at room temperature before use. For optimal performance, foods should be organized strategically within the shelves, ensuring sufficient airflow. Specifically, keep raw meats securely wrapped and monitor the temperatures to avoid spoilage. 

**Defrosting Instructions:**
To manage frost buildup, turn off the appliance and allow it to defrost. Clean off any ice accumulation after the process. 

Users are urged to regularly check for any irregular sounds or flashing lights that may indicate a malfunction and consult the service guide if necessary. Always prioritize proper handling and maintenance for long-lasting appliance performance.

The food appears to be at an excessive temperature. Water collects on the plate, and it flows onto the ground, potentially causing frost if not managed correctly. Ensure that the enclosure is sealed properly and remains clean to avoid issues. Items may be incorrectly positioned or wrapped, which obstructs airflow. It's crucial to maintain the food's temperature and prevent crowding; ensure that the appliance is powered off when necessary. 

For optimal performance, the designated temperature range is +10°C to +32°C for SN, +16°C to +32°C for ST, and +16°C to +38°C for N. The appliance should be positioned with adequate ventilation below and around it. To achieve this, keep the front and top areas clear to allow for proper airflow. To ground the equipment, consult with a professional if necessary. 

Removing shelves is straightforward: follow the directional arrow to detach them. When adjusting or reversing components, carefully unscrew and reposition as needed. Ensure that all parts are properly secure after alteration, and allow the appliance to rest for at least four hours after repositioning.
