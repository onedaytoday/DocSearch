**Safety and Operating Instructions**

This document provides essential guidelines for the safe and effective operation of your microwave. Please read all instructions thoroughly to minimize the risk of burns, electric shock, or fire. It is crucial to follow grounding instructions to avoid excessive microwave exposure. Ensure that the microwave is properly grounded according to local and national electrical codes to reduce the risk of electric shock.

**Microwave Components and Accessories**

For optimal performance, always use the microwave with the turntable in place. Ensure that food items are evenly distributed and allow for even cooking by stirring or rotating them as necessary. Use microwave-safe containers, including glass, ceramic, and specific plastics designed for microwave use. Avoid using metal or non-microwave-safe materials.

**Cooking Guidelines**

Food should be cooked or reheated to the appropriate internal temperatures to ensure safety:
- Ground meats: 160°F
- Poultry: 165°F
- Fresh food: 170°F
- Leftovers and carry-out: 165°F

Always use potholders when handling hot items to prevent burns. When reheating liquids, be cautious, as they can superheat and boil over suddenly. To promote even cooking, cover food with appropriate lids or microwave-safe coverings.

**Interference Considerations (U.S. Only)**

If the microwave interferes with radio or TV reception, adjustments can often be made by repositioning the microwave or the receiving antenna. This appliance complies with FCC regulations designed to minimize interference.
