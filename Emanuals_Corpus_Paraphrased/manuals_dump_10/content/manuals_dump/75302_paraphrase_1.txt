**Paraphrased Text:**

The system relies on force to operate. The yellow ground wire needs to be connected, and the power supply must be greater than that of the other connections. The relevant supply types include H07 RN-F, H05 RN-F, H05 RR-F, H05 VV-F, H05 V2V2-F (T90), and H05 BB-F, which are compatible with single-phase systems. Responsibility for the operation of the integrated assembly lies with the building's infrastructure, which should ensure proper protection against accidental contact, including suitable coverings or barriers as necessary.

Installation requires careful attention to height; adjustments may be needed to accommodate different elevations. The recess will require proper fastening using four screws for safety, ensuring that the system's operation can be readily accessed when necessary.
