Thank you for choosing the Electrolux cooker hood EFC. Please refer to this user manual for effective operation and maintenance. For customer service or product inquiries, contact us directly. 

### Important Information for Appliance Owners

Please read the instructions carefully. If you have questions about the product, or require additional information, please reach out to customer service. This manual includes important details on extractor and cleaning procedures, cleaning grease and charcoal filters, replacing the charcoal filter, light maintenance, troubleshooting issues, and service conditions.

### Safety Information

Ensure your cooker hood is installed in compliance with local building regulations (BS.6172, BS.5440, BS.6891, BS.5482) and is away from flammable materials. If the cooker overheats or a malfunction occurs, switch off immediately and allow it to cool. Children should be supervised while using the appliance, and they should not operate it unsupervised. Regular maintenance and cleaning of grease and charcoal filters are crucial to prevent fire hazards.

### Operating Instructions

To operate the cooker hood, use the three switches located on the right side at the front. The grease lighting switch (L) controls the light; switch (M) manages the fan operation; and switch (V) regulates the normal settings. For optimal performance, ensure the charcoal filter is properly fitted when cooking.

To maintain efficiency, clean the grease filter once a month or more frequently based on usage. Remove and replace the grease filter by pressing the catch to release it, cleaning it by hand or in a dishwasher, and reinstalling it securely.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Charcoal filters need to be replaced approximately every three months or more frequently if cooking regularly. To replace the charcoal filter, first remove the grease filter, then turn the charcoal filter anticlockwise to remove it. Install a new filter by turning it clockwise into the housing. 

If the light fails to function, ensure the bulb is securely inserted and that you are using a compatible 40W E14 bulb. 

### Troubleshooting and Service Information

For any issues, refer to the troubleshooting section. If the hood does not operate correctly, check that it is connected to the electricity supply and that the switches are in the ON position. If a mechanical failure occurs, please contact Customer Service for assistance.

The warranty does not cover damages caused by improper installation or unauthorized repairs.

### Installation Instructions

This cooker hood must be earthed and must comply with relevant I.E.E. regulations. Connect to a permanent electrical supply and ensure the installation follows all local authorities' regulations. 

It is the installer’s responsibility to ensure compliance with all regulatory standards during installation. 

Make sure to maintain the required clearance from the cooking surface as specified in the technical details. Should you have any questions about the installation process or require assistance, do not hesitate to contact customer service.

To install the unit, secure it as indicated, either from above or using the provided fixing screws. Ensure the height is adjusted according to the specifications, particularly regarding the optional splashback. When mounting the splashback, follow the illustrated instructions to properly position and attach it using the supplied screws. 

If the splashback is intended for use with a freestanding cooker, it should be affixed with both top and bottom screws. Should the installation involve hollow or concrete walls, ensure that the correct screws are applied.

For effective performance, refer to the section titled "Electrical Connection." The extraction system should be installed to meet regulatory standards, and the ducting must align with British or DIN 4102-B1 guidelines. If charcoal filters are used, they should be fitted as per specifications.

When setting up the ducting, keep it as straight and short as possible to maximize efficiency. Avoid tight bends, which may hinder performance. If the cooker relies on gas, ensure the connections are sealed correctly to avoid any gas leaks.

The chimney assembly consists of designated parts, as illustrated, and must be installed carefully. Adjust slightly as needed to ensure proper alignment, and secure with the provided screws, following the guidelines outlined in section (I).
