Here's the paraphrased version of the text:

The light may indicate a reduction in selected settings or options to freshen items. By pressing specific buttons, users can turn the light on or off as needed. This feature allows the user to manage the duration of the lightâ€™s operation based on selected countdown options. If the countdown reaches zero, the light automatically turns off. Users can pause the operation at any time, which will be indicated by a flashing light. 

If the operation is interrupted, the system will enter a locked state until manually reset by selecting the appropriate options. Users are advised to pause the operation if there is an issue rather than forcing the machine to restart, as this could lead to overheating or other complications. 

At the end of a washing program, the light will automatically turn off, indicating completion. Users need to follow proper instructions for switching off the machine and ensuring it is empty before use. 

Several washing programs are available for different fabric types, including cottons, synthetics, and delicate items, each with associated settings. Users can select prewash, economy modes, or specific cycles like "Easy Iron" to minimize creasing. 

Regular maintenance is required to keep the machine functioning efficiently. This includes cleaning the dispenser drawer, drain filter, and water inlet filters. In case of malfunction, users should refer to the troubleshooting guide and follow the instructions to resolve any issues. If problems persist, they should contact service support.
