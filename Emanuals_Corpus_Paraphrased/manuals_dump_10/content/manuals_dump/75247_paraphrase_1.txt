For areas with built-up grease, use a non-scratch cloth and avoid using harsh scrubbing pads that can cause damage. Follow specific instructions for cleaning stainless steel and decorative chrome features. 

**Oven Light Maintenance:**

The oven light is controlled by a switch and should be replaced carefully if burned out. Ensure the oven is cool and disconnect the power supply before performing maintenance. 

**Broiler Pan Care:**

Clean the broiler pan immediately after use to prevent grease build-up. Avoid covering it with aluminum foil during use to ensure proper cleaning.

**Preheating Instructions:**

When preheating for baking, always ensure that the oven is not overcrowded or set to excessively high temperatures, as this can result in uneven cooking. Adjust clearance for even heat distribution and avoid using warped or bent pans. 

**Troubleshooting Issues:**

If you encounter operational issues, such as beeping errors or failure to self-clean, consult the installation manual or contact an authorized service provider. Ensure that all connections are secure and that the power supply is stable.

In case of excessive smoking during broiling, adjust the position of meats to avoid splattering and excess grease build-up.
