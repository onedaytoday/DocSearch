To reset, press the C button for about seconds; you'll see a countdown on the display. If the system turns off, it indicates a warning about the shelves that may cause electric shocks. To switch off the light, use the V switch according to the instructions provided at the back of the light cover.

All food items should be covered and placed on the shelves appropriately. Use airtight packaging for sensitive items like meat, onions, or garlic.

Make sure the appliance is at the right temperature; if it seems too cold or hot, adjust the thermostat as needed. For optimal cooling, maintain cleanliness by regularly wiping the interior and back surfaces.

The FROSTMATIC function should be activated to quickly freeze fresh food. It can be manually turned off if necessary, and the yellow light indicates its status. Be cautious about the frost buildup which may obstruct the appliance's performance; clean it when it gets too thick. 

When defrosting, switch off the appliance, and use proper methods to clean stubborn frost. Once finished, ensure everything is put back in order, allowing food items to cool before storing them again. Follow the guidelines for freezing, ensuring not to overload the appliance and maintaining the correct food types and quantities.

If any additional details or modifications are needed, please specify!

### FROSTMATIC Function Overview

The yellow light indicates the operation of the FROSTMATIC function, which protects fresh food by maintaining optimal freezing conditions. This function can be manually activated or deactivated; however, if left on for an extended period, it may lead to frost build-up inside the appliance. It's essential to monitor the thickness of frost and perform defrosting when it becomes excessive.

To defrost, turn the thermostat to a warmer setting, optional depending on the food being thawed. Once the defrosting process is complete, carefully remove any accumulated frost using layers of newspaper, if needed, and switch off the appliance. 

**Operational Alerts:**
- The defrosting light will flash during operation, along with audible signals. To stop the process, press the ON/OFF button, countdown will begin, indicating when the appliance will shut off.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**
Regular cleaning is vital to prevent potential shock hazards. Ensure the appliance is off when cleaning, and use appropriate cleaners. The interior and connections should be maintained for optimal functioning. 

### Troubleshooting
For issues like insufficient cooling, check the settings. Ensure food items are properly covered to prevent moisture loss and frost build-up. If problems persist, review the related sections for corrective actions or contact service support.
