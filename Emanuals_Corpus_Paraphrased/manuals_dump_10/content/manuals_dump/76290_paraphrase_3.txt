Clean the dishes using appropriate products and cloths. For thorough cleaning, focus on the corners and clean the recess areas using a toothbrush. It’s essential to inspect and maintain the components, such as the hose and any associated parts. If necessary, allow the unit to cool down before removing the emptying hose from its seat. Make sure to properly secure all connections by following these steps: Turn off the water supply, unscrew the hose, and clean it before reattaching. Ensure that the emptying hose is functioning correctly to prevent any issues, particularly if the surrounding temperature drops below 0°C. Always perform routine checks on the emptying hose to maintain proper flow.
