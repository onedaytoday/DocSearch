**Safety Notice:**
For safety, this appliance must be properly grounded. Connect it to a grounded outlet using a three-prong plug. Do not cut or remove the ground prong. Ensure that the grounding wire is green or green-yellow. It is recommended to use a separate circuit for this appliance and to avoid using an extension cord.
