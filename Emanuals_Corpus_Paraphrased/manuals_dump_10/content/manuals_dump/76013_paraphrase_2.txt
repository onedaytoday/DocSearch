**Washer and Rotating Locking Screw Assembly Instructions**

This guide covers the assembly of the washer and the locking screw, along with the sawtooth head. Ensure the F1 stop switch is set to the STOP position. Rotate the screw clockwise to fasten it; this action allows the assembly to operate smoothly. If you turn the screw counterclockwise, it will loosen. 

Before using, verify that the throttle is released and the F3 switch is in the closed position. The backpack unit should allow for an even flow without requiring frequent releases. Maintenance must be conducted exclusively by authorized service personnel to maintain optimal performance.

Clean the gearbox thoroughly every three months, particularly after extensive use, to prevent grease accumulation. Pay attention to the shoulder and hip height when adjusting the backpack for comfort during operations.

For optimal cutting performance, routinely inspect the sawtooth head and replace worn components to ensure efficiency. Avoid letting the sawtooth touch the ground, as this can lead to damage and decreased capacity. Always follow the technical instructions to ensure correct assembly and operation.

Lastly, familiarize yourself with troubleshooting procedures, particularly related to handling kickback and ensuring safe operation of the sawtooth head. Compliance with relevant directives is crucial for safety and performance standards. Ensure you consult the technical documents associated with models BC011 and BC012 for detailed specifications.
