When the acoustic signals indicate, and either SOUND NORMAL or LOW is activated, turn the appliance to OFF. If RINSE HOLD or NIGHT CYCLE is selected, the START/PAUSE light will flash.

To adjust to specific settings like LINEN/EASY CARE with PREWASH, select LINEN/EASY CARE and press the TEMP button multiple times until the desired temperature appears. Similarly, adjust the RPM settings until the required rate is displayed. For PREWASH options, press OPTIONS until the PREWASH function appears and confirm by pressing OK.

To change memory settings, press OPTIONS until SETUP flashes, then confirm changes by pressing OK. You can select memory options for various cycles and configurations directly. 

If the child lock function is activated, turn the dial clockwise to deactivate, following the displayed instructions. Conversely, turning anti-clockwise will activate the child lock.

For cleaning, use gentle cleaning agents and cloths to maintain the appliance. Ensure regular cleaning of components as indicated to prolong the lifespan of the machine.

To diagnose malfunctions, listen for acoustic signals. If warnings appear, such as a blocked water supply, turn off the machine, check valve connections, and ensure hoses are properly connected. If issues persist, contact service support to assist with repairs.

Additionally, ensure proper loading to prevent creasing and maintain efficiency. Be cautious with detergent types and quantities to avoid rinsing issues, and always follow the recommended guidelines for specific fabrics.

This version provides a clear and concise overview of the original instructions, ensuring the technical meaning is preserved while improving readability.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of your text, paraphrased in a clear, technical manner while preserving the original meaning:

Both components should be aligned sideways. Secure component C using the screws indicated. Rotate C as illustrated, aligning it with screws E and attaching the four screws F and G. Fix these screws into place, ensuring that component C is properly positioned to operate in freezing conditions. Any frost or coverage issues could affect the warranty. Ensure that all fittings are securely fastened without any grease or contaminants.

For installations in smaller spaces like shops, ensure the mounting base is firmly secured. The foot should be designed to absorb shock; hence, it must be attached correctly. Adjust the height of the four pre-set screws individually as required.
