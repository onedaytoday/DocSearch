### Care and Cleaning Instructions

**General Precautions:**  
Before turning off the electricity supply, always allow the cooling fan to sufficiently cool down the appliance.

**Cleaning Materials:**  
Avoid using bleach-based cleaners, as they can damage finishes. Harsh abrasives like Brillo pads should not be used on the exterior surfaces as they may scratch finishes. Use a soft cloth for cleaning and remove any cleaning agents promptly.

**Control Knobs:**  
Do not attempt to remove the control knobs from the panel, as this may cause damage and present a safety hazard. Refer to the cleaning instructions for proper maintenance.

**Stainless Steel Components:**  
For stainless steel control knobs and handles, it is crucial to avoid any cleaning materials that could dull the finish.

**Brass-Plated Handles:**  
Similarly, for brass-plated handles, refrain from using cleaners that might dull the finish.

**Grill Pan, Grid, and Oven Shelves:**  
These items are dishwasher safe; however, if heavily soiled, soak them for easier cleaning. Clean the grill pan and oven shelves separately before proceeding with other cleaning.

**Ovens and Grill Compartments:**  
When cleaning inside the ovens or grill compartments, follow the manufacturer’s instructions closely and avoid using aggressive cleaners. 

**Stayclean Surfaces:**  
Stayclean coatings are self-cleaning when exposed to temperatures of around 220°C. To maintain efficiency, allow the temperature to reach this level for at least an hour. Avoid using abrasive cleaners, which can compromise the Stayclean effect.

**Cooking Tips for Stayclean:**  
For optimal cooking, use higher roasting temperatures, as this reduces splattering. Avoid covering meat during roasting to enhance even cooking and prevent over-browning.

**Cleaning Door Glass:**  
For the exterior glass surface, use household cleaners, avoiding bleaches or abrasives.

**Removing Outer Glass:**  
To remove the outer glass, slightly loosen the screws at the top with a screwdriver. Clean the glass carefully, avoiding painted finishes, and ensure everything is securely reassembled.

**Cleaning Inner Glass Panels:**  
Use a soft cloth for cleaning the inner glass. If heavily soiled, avoid abrasive pads.
