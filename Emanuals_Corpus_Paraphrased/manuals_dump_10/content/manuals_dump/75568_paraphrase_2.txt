**Note**: The performance of your appliance may vary based on factors such as the type of cookware and the nature of the food being prepared. Always adhere to the manufacturer's recommendations for optimal results.

**Cooking Instructions**

Preheat the oven for baking cookies, bread, or cakes, as well as for roasting meats. Ensure that the oven is not overcrowded to avoid uneven cooking and overheating. Follow the preheating guidelines closely, adjusting the temperature if required, generally not exceeding the recommended 25°F (12°C). Maintain proper clearance for each dish to prevent warping.

**Cleaning Procedures**

Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and cooled down. Clean spills and heavy soiling promptly to minimize the need for extensive cleaning later. Regular maintenance can reduce the amount of deep cleaning required over time. Use a soft cloth for painted and decorative surfaces, avoiding abrasive cleaners that could damage the finish.

For stubborn stains, a specialized cleaner such as CERAMA BRYTE should be used with caution. Always avoid immersing heating elements in water and do not expose them to harsh scouring pads. 

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**

Activate the self-cleaning function only after allowing the oven to cool. Remove racks and ensure that the cavity is empty before starting the cleaning process. It’s advisable to wear protective gloves during manual cleaning. If any unusual odors or noises occur during operation, this should be addressed immediately.

**Safety Notes**

Always ensure the oven is cool before cleaning, and avoid using protective coatings or abrasive materials during the self-cleaning cycle. Follow the specific instructions for cleaning to maintain safety and efficiency throughout the operation, and prevent any potential hazards from food residues.

**Troubleshooting**

If issues arise, check the installation and configuration of the appliance, considering factors that may cause improper function, such as incorrect cookware or congestion around the heating elements. For persistent problems, refer to the service manual or consult a qualified technician.
