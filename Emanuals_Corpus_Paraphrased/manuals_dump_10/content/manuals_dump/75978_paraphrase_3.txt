### Instruction Manual

**Models:** WRM2000_A-R, WRM2800_A-R, WRM3500_A-R 

This manual provides essential information for selecting and operating your appliance. 

- Ensure that the front of the unit is slightly elevated compared to the back to optimize performance. This setup allows for adequate ventilation and minimizes exposure to direct sunlight or heat sources. Use a dedicated power outlet (230V, single phase AC) and connect the ground wire (green/yellow) at the rear to ensure safety.

- Wipe the appliance thoroughly with a soft cloth to maintain hygiene. Adjust the thermostat to the recommended setting and allow the appliance to reach the desired temperature. It should operate quietly without excessive noise. If issues arise, trace the source of the problem and consult authorized service personnel.

- When ready, the ice cubes can be accessed easily by twisting. Use the warmer setting by turning the thermostat clockwise.

- Store fresh food in the designated compartment at the front. When placing food in the back, ensure items are wrapped securely in airtight containers, such as bottles or bags.

- Regularly defrost the appliance, especially when frost buildup exceeds half an inch. Use a spatula to gently remove frost without disrupting operational performance. Should excessive frost accumulate, turn the unit off and allow for a complete defrosting process. 

- During defrosting, detach the drain cap from the drain bulb as illustrated in the manual. After defrosting, reattach the drain cap.

- For routine cleaning, thoroughly wipe down surfaces with a suitable cloth. Clean the internal components and shelves at least once a month or whenever frost builds up significantly.

- Handle the appliance carefully to avoid scratches or damage, which can affect its efficiency. Ensure that the back of the unit remains free from obstructions and monitor for any mechanical issues.

- Avoid placing the appliance near sources of fire or water to prevent hazards related to insulation and mechanical functions.

- If the appliance does not operate correctly, check the power supply and consult your service provider, especially if the appliance is making unusual sounds or the cooling performance is inadequate.
