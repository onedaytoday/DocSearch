Ensure that installation is performed by qualified personnel. Follow all instructions, including maintaining proper dimensions for water supply, drainage, and appliance placement to prevent malfunction and maintain warranty validity.

### Connecting the Drain Pump  
Only use factory-specified parts and follow prescribed specifications for drain installation. Ensure that the equipment is properly grounded and within the acceptable operating temperature range.

### Connecting the Water Supply  
Follow specified instructions for connecting the water supply line. Use appropriate tools and verify that all connections are secure to prevent leaks.

### Leveling the Unit  
Ensure that the dishwasher is level from front to back and side to side to avoid operational issues.

### Reversing the Door (for Some Models)  
This can be done by detaching specific screws and remounting the door on the desired side. 

### Adjusting the Door  
If necessary, adjustments should be made to ensure the door seals correctly and operates smoothly.

### Built-In Installation  
Ensure that the appliance’s height and position allow for proper operation and access without obstruction. 

Adhere to all local codes and manufacturer specifications throughout installation.

### INITIAL START-UP
The unit is ready for operation once it has been shipped. To power the device, utilize the ON/OFF switch located at the front. Ensure the unit is plugged into a grounded 115V power supply. Turn the switch to the ON position, and the system will begin to operate after a brief delay of a few seconds. During the initial hours of use, make sure to monitor its operation closely.

### CYCLE SELECTOR SWITCH
#### NORMAL OPERATION
Water continuously circulates through the assembly and into the trough. As the water level reaches a certain thickness, the system will automatically shut off. This cycle will repeat itself, contributing to the overall cleanliness of the ice cubes. Pay attention to the sounds produced during operation, as they can indicate whether the ice cube thickness is correct. Variations may occur based on the batch and the processing method used.

### ICE DISPENSER OPERATION CARE
To maintain optimal factory performance, adjust the ice cube thickness setting. As the cubes become thicker, ensure all components are working correctly. Be mindful of warnings regarding thickness. Adjustments should be made carefully to avoid operational issues.

### ICE CUBE THICKNESS ADJUSTMENT DIAL
The thickness dial is factory set; to modify the thickness, rotate the dial clockwise to create thicker cubes or counterclockwise to make them thinner. After adjustments, allow sufficient time for the system to stabilize and produce a new batch.

### SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
To optimize performance, avoid direct sunlight and humidity, as these can lead to mold growth. If ambient temperatures drop below 45°F (7°C) or rise above 110°F (43°C), it may affect unit performance and could void the warranty.

### MAINTAINING AND CLEANING YOUR ICEMAKER
Regular cleaning is essential for longevity and efficiency. Use appropriate cleaning agents specifically designed for stainless steel and avoid harsh abrasives like steel wool or non-stainless cleaners, as these can damage the finish. Perform monthly cleaning using recommended products.

### ADDITIONAL CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS
Avoid abrasive pads that can damage the unit's stainless steel surface. Follow all cleaning guidelines carefully to prevent damage and maintain warranty coverage. Regular cleaning every three months is recommended to ensure efficient operation.

### DRAINING FOR NON-USE
If the unit will not be used for an extended period, disconnect it from power to avoid risks such as electrocution and shock. Ensure that all water is drained and that all connections are properly secured before long-term storage.

### BEFORE YOU CALL FOR SERVICE
If malfunctioning occurs, consult the troubleshooting guide before seeking professional help. Check basic operational parameters such as power supply and cleanliness of surrounding areas. Should the issue persist, contact the original retailer or service provider with relevant information, including model and serial numbers.

### TROUBLESHOOTING
Monitor water supply and check for obstructions. If service is needed, provide detailed information to your service provider regarding the issue, along with the model specifications.
