### Important Safety Instructions
Please read these instructions carefully. Ensure that the appliance is properly grounded, adhering to the National ANSI/NFPA (U.S.A.) or CSA C22.1, PART standards. Only trained technicians should perform services to prevent safety hazards. Wait at least 2 hours before connecting to the power supply. 

**Caution:** To minimize risks when operating the oven, avoid touching interior elements or surfaces until they have cooled. The heating components can become hot enough to cause burns.

**Fire Safety:** In case of small grease fires, use a fire smothering method with a cover or a foam-type extinguisher. Do not leave grease unattended while heating. Avoid placing unopened food containers in the oven as they may explode.

Ensure that air ducts remain unobstructed for optimal performance. Keep heat-sensitive items away from the cooking area while the oven is in operation to prevent damage.

### Instructions for Oven Use

**Oven Functions:**
- The oven features include: Upper Roast, Warm, Bake, Delay, Convection, Broil, Upper Timer, Remove Lower Door, and Clean Racks. 

**Preheating:**
- If preheating is required, refer to the preheat instructions. Preheat temperatures range from 77°C to 288°C. Aim to reach 350°F for optimal cooking conditions.

**Operating Instructions:**
- Use the "UPPER" and "BAKE" functions as needed. When adjustments are made, the indicators may flash. 
- Once the temperature reaches the set point, an audible signal indicates readiness. Adjust the temperature from the default of 350°F up to 425°F as necessary. Ensure proper clearance around food items to prevent warping or overheating.

**Convection Cooking:**
- When using convection settings, reduce cooking time for various foods, especially baked goods. Utilize convection for efficient heat distribution, which promotes even cooking.

**Batch Cooking:**
- Convection cooking is suitable for multiple dish preparations, including defrosting. Food should be arranged to allow heat circulation.

**Roasting:**
- The roasting function is designed to allow heat to circulate around meats while catching grease. Ensure the food is securely placed within the roasting pan to increase efficiency. Avoid covering the food during this process.

**Using the Delay Bake Feature:**
- For delayed baking, ensure the cooking time does not exceed a specific threshold to prevent foodborne illnesses. Typically, health guidelines suggest avoiding extended periods of delay when cooking perishable items.

**Manual Adjustments:**
- In the event of power interruption, manually set the temperature and adjust the clock as required. Make sure racks are positioned correctly before cooking begins.

**Final Notes:**
- For any cooking settings including delayed functions, confirm that selections and modifications are properly indicated. Regular monitoring is recommended to ensure desired cooking outcomes are achieved.

### Setting Up Timed Baking, Convection Baking, or Convection Roasting

To enable timed baking functions, select the appropriate mode: Timed Bake, Timed Convection Bake, or Timed Convection Roast. Set the desired cooking temperature, typically 350°F, and specify the duration using the clock. Once the time is reached, the oven will automatically shut off.

1. **Press the desired cooking mode** (BAKE, UPPER, etc.) and ensure the flashing indicators are displayed.
2. **Adjust the timing** using the clock feature, selecting from a range of hours and minutes.
3. **Once the timer activates**, an alert will sound when the cooking period concludes, and the oven will turn off automatically after a brief interval.
4. Always check the food for proper cooking; food like meat and poultry should be cooked thoroughly to avoid foodborne illnesses.

### Delayed Timed Features

For delayed baking or roasting options, you can set the oven to start cooking later. Ensure the timer is adjusted to initiate the heating process at your desired time. This feature allows flexibility in meal preparation.

### Keeping Warm Function

To engage the Keep Warm feature, select this option, which maintains a temperature of approximately 170°F (77°C). This function can be activated after cooking to keep dishes warm for a few hours.

1. If the Keep Warm feature is selected shortly after cooking finishes, the oven will automatically switch on to keep the food warm.
2. Press the appropriate controls to start this function; the display will indicate active settings.

### Self-Cleaning Feature

When utilizing the self-cleaning option, follow these guidelines:

- Allow the oven to cool before cleaning.
- Wear protective gear while handling the oven's interior.
- Do not use chemicals or manual cleaning tools that might damage the oven.
- Ensure that all racks are removed prior to activating the self-clean function, as they may not withstand high temperatures.

### Safety Precautions

Always monitor your cooking closely to avoid grease fires. In case of a fire, do not use water; instead, smother it or turn off the oven. Keep the self-cleaning oven environment secure to prevent health hazards.

### Sabbath Feature

A specific setting exists for use during Jewish holidays that allows the oven to remain on continuously without manual intervention. Be sure to follow the correct procedures outlined for Sabbath use, limiting the functions to those allowed on the Sabbath.

### General Cleaning Guidelines

When performing general cleaning:

- Allow the oven to cool down completely before cleaning it manually.
- Use only recommended cleaning materials and methods to avoid damage.

By adhering to these instructions, you can effectively utilize your oven’s features while ensuring safety and optimal performance.

### Initiating the Self-Clean Cycle

To begin the self-cleaning process, ensure the oven has cooled down. This usually takes about one hour. The self-clean cycle can last anywhere from two to four hours, depending on the level of soiling. During this process, a light will illuminate to indicate the self-clean mode. DO NOT attempt to override any locks, as the oven will be extremely hot.

To start, press the "CLEAN" button. The display will show "UPPER" and the "DOOR" will be locked. In case you see "REMOVE RACKS," make sure to take out any racks before proceeding. 

The self-cleaning cycle can be delayed by pressing the "DELAY" button if you want it to start later. After the cycle is complete, you will hear three beeps, and the "UPPER" and "DOOR" lights will be illuminated, signaling that the oven has cooled down to a safe temperature.

**General Cleaning**

For routine cleaning, turn off the oven and let it cool. Immediate cleaning of spills and heavy soiling will minimize the need for extensive future cleanings. Use a damp cloth with mild cleaners on painted and chrome surfaces to maintain their appearance. Avoid using scouring pads or harsh chemicals, as they can damage the finish.

For stainless steel parts, utilize specialized cleaners to maintain their appearance. If the oven door needs to be removed or replaced, follow the specific instructions provided in the manual to avoid damaging the hinges.

**Important Notes on Operation and Maintenance**

1. Ensure the oven is properly installed with a stable power supply.
2. If operational issues arise, check for blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers.
3. In case of severe smoking or flames, adjust the placement of meat to minimize grease buildup.
4. Address any issues with soil not being fully removed after the self-clean cycle, as it may indicate insufficient cleaning during that period.
