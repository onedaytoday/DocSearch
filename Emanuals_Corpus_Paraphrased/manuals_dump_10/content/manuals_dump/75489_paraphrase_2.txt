## Operating Instructions

### General Overview
This appliance features either two or four hotplates, each rated at KW. The hotplates function through an induction heating system and require a scraper for maintenance.

### Operation
The yellow/green lights indicate when the unit is operational. These lights activate once the appliance is switched on. If the cooking switch is turned off, the heating will stop immediately. The system uses both heating and thermostatic controls.

During cooking, the appliance will only operate when the cooking switch is engaged. If the switch is turned off during the cooking process, it will deactivate after a short period. The plates will automatically turn on and off based on cooking needs, allowing for a standby mode during which cooking can be preheated without requiring constant supervision.

### Information
Each heating plate can be switched off individually. It is essential to ensure that proper cooking utensils are used, avoiding overheating and damage. Caution: Induction cooktops reach high temperatures and should be operated with care, using protective cloths where necessary.

### Cooking Guidelines
For optimal performance, use suitable cooking pots with induction bases. Avoid using empty pots, as this can lead to overheating. Always monitor the cooking process to prevent components from burning due to excessive heat.

### Cleaning
Clean the cooking area with appropriate cleaners. Use a cloth or non-abrasive solutions. If the surface is made of plastic, clean it immediately to avoid damage. The unit can be maintained using a high-pressure cleaner, avoiding direct contact with electric components.

### Shutdown Procedure
Turn off the appliance after usage. Regular maintenance is advised.

### Errors
If any operational issues arise, consult the display for specific error messages. An overcurrent alert may prompt the user to allow the unit to cool down. Clean the switches and ensure no obstructions are present for optimal performance.

### Storage
Ensure proper storage space is incorporated for the appliance.

### Installation Instructions
Follow the provided instructions carefully for installation and servicing. The user is responsible for operating the appliance correctly and ensuring safety protocols are adhered to.

### Technical Specifications
Refer to the respective technical data for compatible models and their specifications.

### Note
Follow all safety precautions as outlined in the operating manual, including ensuring correct assembly and electrical connections during installation.
