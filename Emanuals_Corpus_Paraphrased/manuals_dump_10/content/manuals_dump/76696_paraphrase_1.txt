**Screen Setup Instructions:**
A. Follow the steps outlined below to position the screen upright against the ground at the junction. Rotate the casing so that the top faces the ground fully and ensure it is properly secured. Avoid tampering with the top locking mechanism during this procedure.

B. Adhere to the instructions to prevent any undesired effects when adjusting the screen's height. These effects can occur if adjustments are not made correctly. Rotate the screen counter-clockwise to adjust the height using the Height Lock/Release feature, located near the carrying handle.

C. Proceed as directed to unlock the height adjustment. Counter-clockwise rotation will release the lock, allowing for height adjustments. Once height adjustments are made, ensure the screen is properly secured and rotate it back to position. Finally, twist the lock clockwise to lock the adjustments in place. Regular maintenance is recommended.
