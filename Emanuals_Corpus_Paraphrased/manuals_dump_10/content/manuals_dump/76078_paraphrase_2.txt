**Electrolux Vacuum Cleaner Operating Instructions**

Thank you for choosing the Electrolux vacuum cleaner. This guide contains important information on the operation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of your device, including details about the hose and accessories for optimal performance.

**Safety Precautions**  
For models Z2315, Z2306, and Z2312, ensure that the vacuum cleaner is connected to an earthed power supply. Avoid forcing any parts, as this could cause damage or void your warranty. Only authorized service personnel should perform repairs covered under warranty.

**Starting the Vacuum**  
Before use, connect the hose until you hear a click to ensure a secure fit. Use the On/Off foot switch to activate the cleaner. Adjust the suction setting accordingly for various surfaces, particularly in corners and tight spaces to prevent scratching.

**Dustbag Replacement**  
Replace the dustbag as soon as it is full, or when the vacuum's performance diminishes. The dustbag should be replaced approximately every three months, or as indicated by the cleaner's performance. Refer to models E51 or EF51 for dustbag specifications.

**Cleaning the Hose and Nozzle**  
If the hose or nozzle becomes blocked, allow the vacuum to cool down before clearing any obstructions. Regularly check and clean the hose to maintain suction efficiency.

**Troubleshooting**  
If issues arise while using the vacuum, check if it is properly plugged in and if a fuse has blown. For persistent issues, consult with authorized service to avoid voiding your warranty.

**Electrical Supply Instructions**  
Ensure that your vacuum cleaner is connected to a suitable supply. For UK connections, use a 13A fused plug. Follow the colored wiring instructions carefully to ensure electrical safety. 

**Fire and Injury Prevention**  
To prevent the risk of fire, electrical shock, and injury, do not use the vacuum in wet conditions or allow it to be used as a toy. Keep the cord away from heat sources and avoid excessive bending.

**Warranty and Service Information**  
This vacuum is covered under warranty for defects in materials and workmanship for the original purchaser. Service should only be performed by authorized personnel to ensure warranty coverage remains valid.
