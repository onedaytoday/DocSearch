### Replacement of Light Bulbs

Both the refrigerator and fresh food compartments feature lighting, which may need replacement over time. 

**CAUTION**: Ensure safety precautions are followed when handling light bulbs and cords. Use appropriate protective gear as needed.

Before proceeding with a service call, check these common issues:
