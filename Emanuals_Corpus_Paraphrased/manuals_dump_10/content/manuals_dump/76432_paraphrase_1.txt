**Sorting and Washing Guidelines**

**Sorting Instructions:**  
Organize items into the following categories: whites, colored garments, synthetics, white cotton fabrics (including shirts), towels, and tablecloths. Pay special attention to items that are usually white or have light-colored synthetic components. Ensure that items are not packed too tightly to allow for effective cleaning.

**Washing Recommendations:**  
Whites should be washed first to maintain their brightness, followed by colored items. It's advisable to treat stubborn stains on items like pillowcases or blouses overnight with appropriate stain removers, ensuring thorough cleaning before washing. For whites and colored fabrics, using bleach is acceptable, but be mindful of following the recommendations outlined in detailed washing charts.

**Cleaning Temperatures:**  
Typically, washing at 60°C is recommended, though some items may require different settings. Use the prewash option if necessary, particularly for heavily soiled items. Ensure that all additives, such as fabric softeners or stain removers, are compatible with the items being washed.

**Drying Instructions:**
Use a suitable drying method based on fabric type, keeping an eye on the drying phase to prevent creasing. Avoid overheating synthetic materials, which may catch fire or develop damage. Utilize the specific drying settings indicated in the user manual.

**Machine Operation:**
For efficient operation, follow the instructions closely for selecting washing and drying programs. Adjust the settings based on the nature of the load, such as selecting prewash for dirty garments. Refer to indicator lights for guidance on the machine's current phase.

In case of issues such as drainage problems, disconnect the machine, follow the outlined steps to release any trapped water, and ensure proper reinstallation of hoses. Always check the user manual for specific troubleshooting guidelines.

By adhering to these organized and precise instructions, optimal cleaning outcomes can be achieved for various fabrics.
