### Introduction

This document outlines the British Council Directive 90/396/EEC regarding cookers, which must be properly installed and operated. It includes comprehensive instructions to ensure safe and efficient cooking. It is essential to follow these guidelines when using the cooker to prepare food.

### Lighting the Cooker

To ignite the hotplate, turn the control to the highest setting and immediately release it. **Warning**: Ensure that the area is clear of flammable materials to prevent fires. If a fire occurs, cover it with a cloth or use another method to smother it and turn off the unit.

### Cooking Instructions

The high-speed heating instructions below will help achieve the desired cooking results. Adjust the heat settings from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then to 'LOW' as needed, depending on the thickness of the food. Regularly monitor the food while cooking to ensure even heating.

### Preheating

Preheating is recommended when cooking items like Yorkshire puddings or yeast-based recipes. Ensure the food is positioned correctly in relation to the cooking surface to facilitate even heating.

### Hotplate Settings

Adjust the hotplate from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then 'LOW' depending on the cooking requirements. Be mindful of the type of cookware used to optimize heat distribution and prevent warping.

### Cooking Chart

Consult the cooking chart for recommended cooking times and shelf placements. Properly thaw items before cooking, especially meat and poultry, and allow for necessary resting times.

### Reheating

To reheat foods, allow them to cool before using the cooker or microwave. Only reheat food once to maintain safety.

### Cleaning

Regular cleaning is important to maintain the cookerâ€™s efficiency and safety. Use recommended cleaning products and methods to avoid any adverse reactions. Thoroughly clean the hotplate and surrounding areas to prevent food residues from causing issues.

### Maintenance and Compliance

Ensure that the cooker is serviced according to the specified regulations. Proper ventilation is essential for effective operation. Follow the guidelines for positioning the cooker and adhering to local safety standards.

This summary encapsulates the key points for safely operating and maintaining your cooker. Proper adherence to these instructions will enhance cooking performance and ensure safety.
