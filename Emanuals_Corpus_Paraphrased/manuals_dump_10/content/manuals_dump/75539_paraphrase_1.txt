To maintain the appearance and functionality of the factory equipment, please refer to the Cleaning section. If the appliance seems excessively hot or cool, it may be operating outside the recommended temperature range. Heat it to 550째F (287째C) and observe any changes in appearance. Quickly release any pressure; the equipment will adjust back to factory settings automatically. If the temperature is off by 35째F (17째C) or more, it indicates a possible issue. 

The self-cleaning feature activates the cleaning light, which is located at the rear of the appliance and shielded. To access it, turn off the appliance or press the release button on the shield. 

For effective cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and follow the provided instructions closely. Use appropriate protection, as the appliance can cause burns. If the cleaning light is lit, it may indicate a malfunction related to appliance clearance or installations that are too tight or improperly placed. 

The appliance may experience issues resulting in error codes F1, F3, or F9. If you face repeated interruptions during the self-cleaning cycle, closely adhere to the cleaning guidelines. 

This warranty covers appliances sold in the U.S.A. and is backed by White Consolidated Industries, Inc. It is applicable only to normal household use, excluding damages resulting from misuse or installation errors. 

For service inquiries, connect with an authorized servicer, as issues caused by unauthorized repairs or deviations from the usage guidelines will void the warranty.
