**Placement and Cooking Guidelines**

When using the oven, position food items centrally on the shelf to facilitate even heat distribution, which helps prevent splattering. Adjust the cooking settings to accommodate various food thicknesses. Foods should be cooked thoroughly to avoid splashes, and when preparing meats, consider lightly coating them with oil for enhanced browning. Preheat the oven to a high setting prior to grilling or toasting, and turn foods as needed during the cooking process.

**Grilling Chart**  
Position and timing for grilling different items should be carefully monitored to achieve optimal results.

**Top Oven Functionality**

The top oven is ideal for various cooking methods, and you should rotate food to ensure even cooking. Always preheat the top oven before use. When using the top oven, turn on the light and ensure the area around the food is clear for effective heat circulation.

**Oven Heat Zones**

In the main oven, be aware of differing heat zones; the top area is slightly hotter than the bottom. For optimal cooking, adjust food placement according to these zones. Always preheat the main oven before cooking and monitor various food types that may require different cooking times.

**Cooking Times and Internal Temperatures**

Refer to specific charts for roasting temperatures and times for various meats to ensure proper cooking. It is crucial to cover food when needed and monitor internal temperatures closely for safety.

**Slow Cooking Techniques**

Slow cooking is energy-efficient and ideal for tougher cuts of meat. Foods prepared with this method benefit from longer cooking times. Ensure everything is thawed and properly seasoned. Cover pots tightly to retain moisture, and reheating should be done gently to maintain food quality.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and cool. Use appropriate cleaning products that won’t damage finishes, avoiding bleach and harsh materials. Clean different surfaces carefully to preserve their integrity.

**Removable Parts and Cleaning**

For removable wire racks and shelves, ensure they’re unhooked and cleaned appropriately. The hotplate should be cleaned regularly to ensure optimal operation, and care should be taken to reassemble parts correctly after cleaning.

**Interior Cleaning Guidelines**

The grill and oven compartments should be cleaned manually around the Stayclean surfaces, using suggested cleaners and avoiding abrasive materials. Regular maintenance helps sustain performance and appearance.

**Door Maintenance**

To clean between the door panels, follow specific guidance for removal and reassembly, ensuring safety and maintaining the integrity of the glass surfaces. If damage occurs, consult service professionals for assistance.
