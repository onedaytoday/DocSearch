### Preheating Instructions

**Preheating Overview**  
Preheat your oven before roasting or baking food. The recommended preheating temperature range is between 170°F and 550°F (77°C to 288°C). To preheat to 350°F, adjust the oven racks as needed. 

**Preheat Procedure**  
To initiate preheating, press the appropriate buttons until "UPPER" and "BAKE" appear. You will see "PRE" flashing, indicating the oven is in the preheating phase. Once the temperature reaches 350°F, an audible signal will notify you to place your food in the oven.

**Adjusting Temperatures**  
If you plan to preheat to a higher temperature (up to 425°F), follow the same procedure. The "UPPER" and "BAKE" indicators will flash until the desired temperature is achieved, at which point the oven will sound an alert. 

**Baking Instructions**  
When baking items such as cookies, breads, and cakes, ensure the oven is adequately preheated. Following temperature instructions is essential to achieve optimal cooking results. An overcrowded oven or incorrect temperature settings can lead to uneven cooking.

### Convection Cooking Instructions

**Convection Baking Insights**  
For convection cooking, preheat your oven to 350°F. Indicators for "UPPER," "BAKE," and "CONV" will appear, confirming the convection mode is active. This mode circulates heated air, promoting faster and more even cooking. Adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the type of food and recipe guidelines, typically reducing cooking time by 25°F or about 14°C when using convection.

**Convection Roasting Guidance**  
When roasting, ensure that the oven’s grease catch is properly placed to enhance heat circulation around the food. Avoid overcrowding, it’s essential to maintain ample space for proper air flow.

**Final Tips**  
Always follow recommended temperature settings and adjust as necessary based on your specific cooking requirements. Clean oven racks regularly to maintain optimal performance.

### Convection Conversion Feature Setup

To effectively utilize the Convection Convert function, it is essential to begin with the food set to the appropriate temperature. This feature is specifically designed for use with the Convection Convert CF mode or other settings, allowing for a temperature reduction. When the cooking is nearly complete, you'll hear a sound indicating that it is close to being finished, usually a few seconds before completion. 

To activate the Convection Convert function to 350°F, simply press the relevant buttons. If the display shows "UPPER" and "BAKE," select these options accordingly. You should also see "CONV" on the display alongside the selected temperatures, which may indicate that the set temperature is about 325°F. The rotation inside will begin once you press the correct buttons, allowing for even cooking.

### Setting Delayed Bake or Delayed Convection Bake

Use the Delayed Bake or Delayed Convection Bake option for cooking certain items, including meats, in advance. Always ensure that the food is prepared promptly before the cooking period begins to avoid any foodborne illnesses.

To initiate the Delayed Bake at 350°F, you need to manually set the clock and ensure that selected food items are placed in the proper rack positions. Follow the same button-press methods as above to confirm your selections.

### Timed Bake or Timed Convection Bake Setup

For Timed Bake or Timed Convection Bake, adjust the cooking duration to suit your needs. You can do this through the same button options, selecting as necessary until the "UPPER," "BAKE," and "TIMED" options light up on the display. This ensures that cooking finishes automatically at the desired time.

### Broiling Instructions

Activate the broil function to prepare food by applying high heat from above. Allow the broiler to preheat until it becomes red-hot, usually requiring a short duration. Make sure to season your food before placing it under the broil element. Always follow the specific cooking times outlined in your recipes, especially for thick cuts of meat.

Note that grease can catch fire when subjected to intense heat, so monitor your cooking closely. Always keep a fire extinguisher handy and do not attempt to extinguish a grease fire with water.

### Sabbath Feature

The Sabbath Feature is available for use during Jewish holidays. Carefully follow the specified instructions if you wish to utilize this setting.

### Self-Cleaning Feature Instructions

Before using the self-cleaning option, allow the oven to cool down completely. Wear appropriate gear while cleaning to ensure safety. Avoid using any cleaners or protective coatings that could interfere with the self-cleaning process. When activated, the self-cleaning cycle uses high heat to eliminate debris.

To start a self-cleaning cycle, ensure that the oven is cool and then follow the prompts to initiate cleaning. This cycle typically lasts several hours depending on the level of soiling. 

If any issues arise—such as indicators prompting to "REMOVE RACKS"—follow the on-screen instructions to prepare the oven for cleaning.

**Cleaning Instructions for the Upper Door and Self-Cleaning Function**

To initiate the self-cleaning function, ensure the upper door is locked. The "DOOR" and "LOCKED" indicator lights will flash. Allow approximately 30 seconds for the system to respond. During the self-clean cycle, the "UPPER," "DELAY," and other relevant indicators will illuminate. You can remove the lower door racks as needed.

**General Cleaning Guidelines**

- Always clean spills and heavy soil immediately to minimize thorough cleaning later.
- Regular maintenance helps reduce the need for intensive cleanings.
- Use a soft cloth or appropriate cleaner for painted, decorative, or chrome surfaces. 
- Avoid direct application of strong cleaners or abrasive materials, as they can damage finishes.
- If necessary, cover surfaces before using aggressive cleaning materials.

**Care for Stainless Steel**

Refer to the dedicated cleaning section for maintaining stainless steel appearance. 

**Removing and Replacing the Oven Door**

To remove the oven door, rotate the hinge at the top until it releases. Follow the special care instructions carefully to avoid damage.

**Hidden Bake Element Cover Access**

To access the hidden bake element cover, pull the cover backward slightly and lift it out. Remember to turn off the oven light when replacing it, as the light should be shielded during use. Always ensure the oven is cool before performing any maintenance.

**Troubleshooting Common Issues**

1. **Oven Does Not Operate:** Check power supply and connections. If issues persist, consult a professional service.
2. **Oven Light Malfunction:** Replace the burned-out bulb.
3. **Excessive Smoke or Flames:** This may indicate high levels of grease. Avoid covering items that could cause flare-ups and ensure proper spacing while broiling.
4. **Self-Cleaning Cycle Issues:** If soil remains after a self-clean, consider running the cycle again.
