For different modes such as roasting meat, the settings vary depending on the thickness and type of food. For example, the parameters differ for short roasts, coated meats, and trouts, as well as for baking cakes at specified temperatures, such as high yeast cakes or apple cakes with honey. The recommendations include preheating with top heat and hot air at the designated settings.

The cooking process may involve frying and toasting at varying degrees, while ensuring that food preparation adheres to recommended treatments to prevent overcooking. It is crucial to avoid placing items that exceed height recommendations, which could lead to cooking errors. 

For cleaning, it is important to ensure that the appliance is cool and switched off before beginning. Utilize steam and high-pressure cleaning methods, if necessary, while avoiding harsh scouring agents that could damage surfaces. Grease build-up should be regularly managed. 

Professionals should ensure that all installations comply with safety standards and that connections are secure. This includes referencing the VDE standards based on the appliance's type plate, ensuring optimal operation. Additionally, the heating components should be appropriately rated, with protective features in place to prevent overheating and ensure safe installation.

Finally, the installation of built-in units must consider appropriate spacing and clearance for efficient ventilation and operation, adhering to the manufacturer's specifications.
