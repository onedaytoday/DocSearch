### Fresh Food Storage Guidelines

To optimize fresh food storage, avoid overcrowding shelves, which can impede cooling efficiency. Ensure that meat and other perishables are stored securely and away from heat sources, such as dishwashers. Following proper insulation guidelines and keeping the refrigerator tightly packed can enhance efficiency. It's important to manage temperature settings to prevent overcrowding and minimize heat buildup, particularly from sunlight. 

**Short Vacations:** For periods longer than three months, ensure food storage settings are adjusted accordingly. Regularly clean and maintain your appliance and keep it organized. Items should be packed securely in the vehicle while in transit, and build-up should be cleaned immediately using appropriate scouring brushes or dishwashers. 

**Cleaning Instructions:** When cleaning, always turn off the appliance to avoid damaging components or scratching surfaces. Use non-abrasive cloths and avoid strong cleaners containing bleach or scouring agents, as they can damage surfaces.

If you encounter cooling problems, check for common issues like power disruptions or appliance malfunctions. Ensure the appliance is clean, and the door seals are intact. If the CONTROL LOCK feature is enabled, press it for three seconds to unlock. If issues persist, consult a technician.
