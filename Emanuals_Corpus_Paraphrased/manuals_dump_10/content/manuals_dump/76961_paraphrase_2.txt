**DC Power Supply Specifications**

The DC supply must adhere to the technical requirements outlined in EN60950 or the relevant directives. When the supply includes AC input (via isolation), it should activate protective measures in compliance with EN60742. The following stipulations apply to the DC supply: it is recommended to use a single-phase rectified DC source with specified voltage and current levels. The placement of the supply should ensure minimal distance from the amplifier (within several feet). 

For high-inertia loads, the power supply must operate efficiently; otherwise, it should be monitored closely, especially when the amplifier is in use.

**Thermal Management**

Effective heat dissipation from the component mount is essential, with a thermal resistance of C/W. The thermal shutoff temperature must be specified so that system heat does not exceed certain limits, shown graphically below for various current levels (Whistle C at specified voltages).

Charts are provided based on worst-case scenarios to monitor operating conditions and allowable temperature increases. Adherence to these charts is crucial for maintaining system reliability.

**Command & Input Specifications**

The input operating voltage is critical for performance, with specified thresholds and duration limits for safe operation. Resistor configurations may be necessary to accommodate allowed input levels, especially in connection to amplifiers. Proper voltage references must be maintained internally at certain conditions.

**ECLC and ECLP Connections**

Connections for both ECLC and ECLP must meet minimum resistance and voltage requirements to guarantee proper amplifier operation. A short circuit condition should be monitored and latching mechanisms considered in case of faults.

**Function Options**

Function indications such as AOK, SO1, SO2, and SO3 signal overall system status and detect short conditions. These outputs must be reliable, and any misleading readings must be verified against operational parameters.

**Specifications Summary**

- **A.1** Key metrics include DC supply voltage and efficiency ratings, applicable to PCB mounts.
- **A.2** Non-operating temperature ranges, mechanical shock standards, and humidity tolerances are detailed.
- **A.3** Quality and compliance specifications outline requirements from various standards including ISO, MIL-STD, and EMC directives. This guarantees compliance in fields such as aircraft and vehicle applications.

**Environmental and Regulatory Compliance**

Additionally, adherence to WEEE and RoHS regulations is required, promoting environmentally safe disposal practices for electronic components.
