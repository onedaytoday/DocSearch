For any uncertainties or issues, please contact authorized service representatives for guidance.

### SECOND OVEN

The second oven efficiently heats the top and bottom sections for cooking food. It is designed for baking cakes and other dishes at temperatures as low as 100°C.

#### USING THE SECOND OVEN
To operate the oven, turn the dial to the 'O' position. 

#### THINGS TO NOTE
Once the oven reaches the desired temperature, it will cycle on and off, indicated by a light. This light displays the oven's operational status as it cools down.

#### FITTING THE SECOND OVEN SHELF
The cranked shelf should align straight with the back of the oven. Proper installation is essential to avoid performance issues. 

#### HINTS AND TIPS
When roasting or preparing casseroles, consider the positioning of the shelf: count upward from the base. Ensure at least the top of the food is visible and evenly spaced to facilitate heat circulation. This method is particularly beneficial for baking Yorkshire puddings or cakes. For optimal browning, use enamelware or heavy non-stick dishes, which enhance heat distribution. Avoid covering food or layering meats, as this can impede browning and cooking efficiency. Always use pre-heated cookware and steer clear of rough materials to prevent sticking and splatters.

### MAIN FAN OVEN

This oven type is suitable for a wide range of cooking methods. 

#### PREHEATING
Preheat the oven to achieve optimal cooking temperatures. Cooking without preheating may lead to suboptimal results. 

#### COOKING TEMPERATURES
Follow the recommended temperature settings listed on the chart, adjusting by 20°C-25°C when necessary.

### BATCH BAKING
The fan oven can cook multiple items simultaneously. Ensure that shelves are correctly positioned, allowing for even heat distribution. 

#### THINGS TO NOTE
Similar to the second oven, the fan oven will also cycle on and off. The internal light indicates cooking progress, and cooling functions maintain efficiency.

#### FITTING THE MAIN OVEN SHELVES
The shelves should align straight with the back and be positioned correctly. They are numbered from the bottom upward.

### HINTS AND TIPS
For batch cooking, positioning the dishes on central shelves allows heat to circulate more freely. Avoid overcrowding to ensure thorough cooking. If using unconventional materials, avoid direct contact with heat sources to prevent excessive browning. Adjust temperatures based on the cooking chart as necessary.

### OVEN COOKING CHART
This chart provides guidance for cooking foods at specified temperatures, with position recommendations for both the fan and second oven.

### ROASTING CHART
Use this chart for optimal cooking and internal temperature guidelines for various meats.

#### DEFROSTING
This function defrosts foods without applying heat. It's ideal for delicate items like cakes with icing or cheesecakes.

#### USING DEFROST FEATURE
Monitor the process as the fan will operate intermittently. Thawing meat can be expedited using this feature, but food must be cooked immediately after defrosting to avoid bacterial growth.

### HELPFUL HINTS WHEN BUYING AND PREPARING FOOD
Follow food safety guidelines regarding storage and reheating to prevent contamination. Purchase the freshest items possible and store perishables appropriately.

### CARE AND CLEANING
ALLOW THE COOLING FAN TO OPERATE BEFORE SHUTTING OFF THE POWER SUPPLY.

#### CLEANING MATERIALS
Use appropriate cleaning solutions to protect the oven's surface finish. Avoid bleach-based cleaners.

#### CLEANING THE OUTSIDE
Use a soft cloth and suitable cleaners to maintain the exterior of the oven.

#### CLEANING THE BRASS HANDLES
Use only recommended cleaning materials for brass to avoid dulling the finish.

#### CLEANING INSIDE THE OVENS
Use non-abrasive cleaners to maintain the oven's interior, following instructions closely.

#### CLEANING THE DOOR GLASS
Use suitable cleaning agents to maintain visibility. For heavily soiled areas, specific techniques may be required.

#### REPLACING THE INNER GLASS PANEL
Follow the correct procedure to ensure the glass is properly seated.

#### CLEANING THE GRILL AND OVEN FURNISHINGS
Most components can be washed in a dishwasher or by hand.

#### REPLACING AN OVEN LIGHT BULB
Always disconnect the oven from the power supply before replacing the bulb. Follow safety protocols closely.
