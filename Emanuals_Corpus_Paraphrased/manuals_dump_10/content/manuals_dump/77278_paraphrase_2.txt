To integrate the following products into your home theater setup: First, connect the VCR. This configuration requires sophisticated audio capabilities to ensure that sound matches the action onscreen, enabling listeners to perceive audio cues coming from the appropriate direction. The system employs surround sound technology to enhance the audiovisual experience. It distinctly differentiates between front and surround sounds, including specific effects, such as crashes. The setup has evolved over the years to deliver an engaging performance through the Surround DVD-Logic-System. 

When setting up your active subwoofer, it's advised to connect it properly to ensure optimal performance. Utilize the cables provided and connect the high outputs to the corresponding active subwoofer ports. Next, connect the front channels to deliver a rich, dynamic sound experience.

Excitingly, the active subwoofer manages sound phases, which is essential for reducing bass distortion. Proper placement of the subwoofer is crucial; avoid corners to enhance acoustic performance. Ensure that the built-in amplifier in the A-10.2 model is fully operational.

**Warning!** To minimize electrical shock hazards, ensure the unit is either covered or disconnected from power sources during service and troubleshooting.
