The AEG-ELECTROLUX EWD1477 is a washer-dryer that comes with specific information, specifications, and instructions. Proper care and maintenance are essential, as improper handling, especially by inexperienced individuals, can lead to serious issues. 

It is crucial to avoid washing items that may be contaminated with oil or grease, as these materials can spontaneously ignite when exposed to heat during the washing process. The oxidation reaction triggered by heat can create conditions for combustion, so it's vital to follow the manufacturer's guidelines meticulously. 

To minimize fire risks, ensure items are free from such contaminants before placing them in the washer-dryer. Additionally, avoid using cleaning chemicals containing trichloroethylene, which can be hazardous. Always follow the proper washing instructions for various materials, including those requiring dry-cleaning. 

Certain items, like rubber-coated products, pillows, and certain types of clothing, should not be dried in the washer-dryer due to their potential to catch fire. 

Furthermore, keep the washer-dryer out of reach of children and assist those who may be infirm to prevent accidents such as suffocation. For additional safety and compliance, refer to the detailed instructions provided with the appliance.
