**Options and How to Use Them**

To use the device, press the button to turn the light on, then proceed as directed. If the machine is locked, it may need to be turned off first. If the light is on, check if the appliance is currently heating or if the temperature is too high. In case the device shuts off automatically, an acoustic signal will indicate that it is finished.

**Sorting Laundry**

Follow the sorting instructions to correctly categorize laundry items. Items should be sorted into whites, colors, and synthetics. New colored items should be washed separately before being combined with others, such as pillowcases. Treat stains with suitable pre-treatments or overnight soaking if necessary. Always wash whites first, using bleach only on whites and colors specifically labeled for it.

Consider the optimum temperature settings for different load types, ideally washing whites at 60°C. The selected wash program should accommodate the load type and quantity accordingly. Refer to the specific program instructions to ensure proper water levels.

**Washing Programs Summary**

1. **Cotton**: Effective programs for typically soiled whites and colored items, recommend using 40°C or 60°C.
2. **Synthetics**: Best for synthetic materials, with a gentle wash option.
3. **Delicates**: Short washing and rinsing cycles for delicate fabrics.
4. **Handwash**: For sensitive garments requiring gentle cleaning.
5. **Sport Intensive**: Designed for heavily soiled and durable items.

**Care and Maintenance**

Before cleaning, ensure the machine is disconnected from the power supply. Regularly clean the exterior and interior components to prevent buildup. Inspect hoses and connections for blockages.

**Emergency Emptying**

When emptying the machine, ensure that it has cooled down. Unscrew and remove the drain hose carefully, allowing any residual water to flow out, then securely reattach it.

For troubleshooting, check if any warning indicators light up. If necessary, consult the manual for detailed instructions or contact service support.
