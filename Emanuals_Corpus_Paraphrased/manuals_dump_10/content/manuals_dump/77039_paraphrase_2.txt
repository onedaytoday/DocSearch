The touchmonitor connects to computers, facilitating touch interactions through ELO technology. For specific ELO monitors, use the "Select Match Touch" feature for compatibility. The touchscreen employs Projected-Capacitive technology that reports touch signals to Windows XP and later systems.

In case of issues with the touchmonitor, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact ELO service for assistance. When switching off the device, make sure to turn it off, disconnect the DC power, and adjust settings from the “About Touchmonitor” section to adjust brightness. Note that the display may flash during power-off.

The LCD touchmonitor models (1519L and 1919L) support various input resolutions—VGA, SVGA, WXGA, XGA, SXGA, UXGA—displaying typical resolutions at a brightness level designed for optimal visibility. It supports multiple aspect ratios and offers a range of input options.
