### Final Safety Tips
Avoid using the warming feature in the presence of grease to prevent flare-ups. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; use a suitable fire extinguisher instead. Follow all manufacturer instructions for safe operation and maintenance.

The cooking process involves applying heat to food, which facilitates cooking. This heat is uniformly distributed, allowing for even cooking and slight increases in temperature for items like breads and reductions. Depending on the food type, adjustments may be necessary regarding cooking time and temperature.

When using the oven, set the temperature to 350째F and press "BAKE." The "BAKE" indicator will light up, indicating that the oven is preheating. The internal fan circulates hot air for even cooking. If cooking racks are used, ensure they are positioned correctly. Once the desired temperature is reached, a sound will alert you.

For Sabbath mode, the oven will operate under specific conditions. Make sure that the timer settings and other functions are adjusted accordingly for appropriate use during this period. 

The Self-Cleaning feature utilizes high temperatures to eliminate food residues without chemical cleaners. Ensure the oven is not obstructed with other items, and allow it to cool significantly before opening. Care should be taken when using this function, especially around children, as surfaces become extremely hot. 

When cleaning, avoid using abrasive materials or cleaners that could damage finishes. Follow specific instructions for painting grates and surfaces to maintain integrity. It's essential to adhere strictly to cleaning protocols to preserve the appliance's condition. For detailed guidance on cleaning various components, refer to the appropriate sections in the manual.
