This document outlines the usage of various washing machine programs and the types of additives, including starching agents. Ensure to follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the type and amount of water sourced from either the supply or the local authority. 

In terms of temperature settings, the machine is capable of processing laundry at temperatures ranging from 30°C to 95°C, applicable for both colored and white fabrics. Programs include options for lightly and heavily soiled items, synthetics, and delicate fabrics such as wool, which must be handled according to special care guidelines, including the use of a gentle cycle. 

For optimal cleaning, ensure regular maintenance of the machine components such as the top catch and recess areas to prevent buildup. It is crucial to disconnect the unit from electrical supply during maintenance and to clean hoses and filters to prevent blockages. 

In case of a malfunction, indicator lights will inform you of specific errors (E10, E20, E40, etc.), typically related to water supply issues or blockages in the hoses. Immediate action is required each time a fault code appears. 

The hose should be appropriately connected for efficient water supply, adhering to local building regulations and using correct installation techniques.

For safety purposes, electrical connections must be verified, ensuring all wires are appropriately color-coded—brown for live (L), blue for neutral (N), and green/yellow for earth (E). Should repairs be necessary, these must be performed by an authorized technician to prevent hazards such as electric shock.

Regular checks on the machine's various components and adherence to these instructions will assure efficient operation and longevity.

**Installation Instructions**  
To integrate the components correctly, begin by positioning the hoses at the back to prevent them from becoming pinched or entangled. 

**Preparation and Assembly**  
Initially, the assembly process requires that screws be securely fastened. Pay attention to the recommended thickness for height adjustments. Ensure the base height is appropriately set before attaching components. 

**Mounting Guidelines**  
Use the specified screws for secure mounting. Double-check the thickness requirements to align perfectly with the screws specified. The operation of the device depends on these being installed accurately. If misaligned, adjustments will be necessary for proper plate positioning.

**Other Considerations**  
For optimal clearance and security, use four countersunk screws at the front of the plinth. This setup will ensure stability and proper function. Consult local regulations for installation and recycling guidelines, and reach out to your local waste management service for recycling information.

**Warranty and Service**  
The product is warrantied against defects in workmanship for a specified period post-purchase. Should repairs be necessary, utilize authorized service providers to maintain warranty coverage. For further inquiries or assistance, contact Customer Service through the provided channels or visit the official website. 

**Country-Specific Instructions**  
Instructions may vary by country; please refer to the local service guidelines for specific requirements. Ensure you keep the purchase documents, as they may be required for service eligibility. 

For European customers, further assistance can be found by contacting the respective customer service numbers or websites for your region.
