### Instruction Sheet: PN Sensor/Process Application Compatibility

#### Specifications
The operational responsibility of the **Sensor Application** lies with the user. The device operates within a temperature range of up to 122°F (50°C) and features a ½ inch MNPT connection made from Polysulfone and Teflon TFE. The cathode is constructed from E.I. Teflon.

**Flow Cells:** 
- Model **CPVC**: Suitable for temperatures up to 122°F (50°C) with NFPT connections.  
- Model **PVC**: Rated for 120°F (49°C) with NFPT connections.  
- Model **Polyester/Polycarbonate**: Acceptable for temperatures up to 158°F (70°C).  
- Model **316SS**: Contains specifications applicable to the specified flow parameters.

**Caution:** Refer to the accompanying information for specifications and operational guidelines.

#### Installation
For the **Model 499A OZ**, ensure proper flow as outlined below, targeting a velocity of 0 to 10 ft/sec. The 499A OZ is not designed for submersion.

#### Wiring 
Refer to the wiring diagrams for proper connections. Ensure that any EMI/RFI precautions are taken into account during installation.

#### Calibration
Calibration of the **499A OZ** is necessary upon initial service and every several months thereafter. Follow the prescribed procedures accurately. If the device has been inactive for an extended period, allow it to operate for a minimum of one hour before taking measurements.

#### Maintenance
Regular maintenance and cleaning are important for optimal performance. Cleaning should occur every four months, or sooner if performance degradation is noticed. 

**Cleaning Instructions:**
- Clean the membrane using a spray from a clean bottle.
  
**Replacing Electrolyte Solution and Membrane:**
- Unscrew the assembly, inspect the cathode for tarnishing, and clean it as needed. If scratches are present, ensure proper finishing.

**Warning:** Be cautious during handling to prevent overflow and damage to the threads.
