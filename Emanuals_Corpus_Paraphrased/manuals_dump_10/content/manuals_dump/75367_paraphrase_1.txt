#### Self-Cleaning Process

The DOOR indicator will flash during cleaning and will automatically lock. After the cycle, wait for the oven to cool before opening the door.

### GENERAL CLEANING

Ensure the oven is OFF and COOL before cleaning. Address spills and heavy staining promptly to minimize the need for deep cleans later. For painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces, clean with a soft cloth and avoid harsh chemicals that might scratch.

### OVEN LIGHT

The oven light can be activated via a switch located on the front. The glass shield covering the light must be in position during use. When replacing or cleaning the shield, ensure the oven is cool and take appropriate precautions.

### BROILER PAN CLEANING TIPS

Avoid covering the broiler pan while cooking to prevent grease splatter. Clean residual grease immediately after cooking while the pan is still warm, but handle with care.

### COMMON COOKING ISSUES

Ensure proper preheating to avoid issues like undercooked cookies or baked goods. Follow recommended temperatures closely, and avoid overcrowding the oven. Adjust the cooking time accordingly if overloading or if items are warped or positioned too close to one another.

### SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE

If you encounter issues such as error codes or the oven not operating, follow the provided instructions to troubleshoot. Ensure connections are secure and consult an authorized service technician if problems persist.

### SELF-CLEANING CYCLE TRoubleshooting

If the self-cleaning cycle doesn’t start, verify that the oven door is closed properly and check for power interruptions. Excessive smoking during broiling may indicate the need to reduce the meat's proximity to the heating element, and grease should be addressed regularly to avoid buildup.
