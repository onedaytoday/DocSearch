### SG and Instructions

#### Introduction
This document provides essential information related to the British C.E. Directive 90/396/EEC. It details the proper use and operation of the equipment, and includes comprehensive instructions for those handling or operating the device.

#### Lighting the Hotplate
To ignite the hotplate, turn the dial to the highest setting and immediately release it after pressing. **Warning**: If you encounter a flame spread or the ignition fails, cease operation and refer to the safety guidance. Note that the hotplate will only shut off when it's turned to the 'OFF' position.

#### Cooking Temperature Management
The heat intensity can be adjusted from 'OFF' to 'LOW' to 'HIGH.' Utilize the correct setting based on the food being prepared. Regular monitoring is necessary to ensure even cooking.

#### Food Positioning and Preheating
Preheating the hotplate is crucial for optimal cooking. Position food appropriately according to thickness and type—thinner items on higher shelves, thicker ones lower. Preheating is especially important for items like bread or meats, ensuring even heat distribution.

#### Cooking Performance
Regularly check that food is placed centrally on the hotplate for consistent cooking. Avoid overcrowding to ensure air circulation and efficient heat transfer. Turn items over as needed for uniform cooking results.

#### Roasting Considerations
When roasting, it may be necessary to cover food items to retain moisture and uniform cooking. Monitor the internal temperature to ensure proper doneness without overcooking.

#### Cooking Chart Reference
For precise cooking guidelines, refer to the cooking chart which outlines times and temperatures based on item thickness and type. This includes recommendations for meats, vegetables, and baked goods. 

#### General Cooking Tips
Utilize lower temperatures for tougher cuts of meat to enhance tenderness. Ensure that internal cooking temperatures reach safety standards. Always thaw meat thoroughly before cooking to guarantee even results.

These instructions serve as a comprehensive guide to ensure efficient and safe operation of the cooking equipment, leading to optimal culinary results.

## Paraphrased Text

### Cooking Instructions

Begin by placing soups or meats on the hotplate for cooking. Ensure the food is tightly covered and then reduce the heat to simmer. Allow for proper cooking by thawing meat thoroughly before thickening with cornstarch, which can help maintain its texture during cooking, preventing curdling. When reheating food, it should be cooled and should not be reheated more than once, whether using a conventional or microwave method.

### Cleaning Guidelines

Maintaining cleanliness is crucial to prevent fires and spillage. Use approved polishes and cleaners for the hotplate and avoid excessive force when cleaning it. The cooking surfaces need regular cleansing to ensure efficient operation and maintain their finish. 

### Hotplate Maintenance

Regularly clean the top of the hotplate and inspect cooking crowns. If they appear burnt or contaminated, clean them gently using suitable scouring materials. Make sure to keep the hotplate functioning by ensuring the crowns are properly positioned and not obstructed, allowing for optimal heat distribution.

### Safety and Installation Instructions

Ensure the appliance is installed in a well-ventilated area according to safety guidelines and specifications. It’s essential to consult the installation and operational instructions carefully. 

### Technical Specifications

The hotplate's dimensions and required connections include specific types and standards. Essential components, such as the ignition battery (AA), should be regularly checked for functionality. 

## Important Safety Information

This appliance must comply with current safety regulations. Ensure proper ventilation to prevent hazards associated with combustion gases. Any installation should be aligned with designated guidelines to minimize risks.

### Location and Installation

The appliance should not be situated in bathrooms or similar areas. It must maintain appropriate clearance above floor level as outlined in the guidelines to ensure safe operation.

### Required Installation Components

Level the appliance correctly using the front and rear adjustment mechanisms. It is advisable to use stabilizing brackets as specified in the installation guide while ensuring proper distance from surrounding structures for safety.

### GAS CONNECTION

To connect gas, ensure that the R/8 B.S.P. threaded fitting is positioned beneath the hotplate. **NOTE:** Utilize only liquid sealants when connecting the inlet gas pipe to the reset valve; **DO NOT** apply P.T.F.E. sealant tape. Ensure the gas supply is adequate and the hose is appropriately secured.

**IMPORTANT:** Flexible tubing must meet current BS standards. L.P.G. flexible connections should be specifically designed for L.P.G. service and capable of operation at high pressures, with a red stripe, band, or label indicating compliance.

### INSTALLING THE BATTERY

The battery compartment is located at the front plinth. To install the battery, follow the designated steps carefully.

### PRESSURE TESTING

Conduct the pressure test by loosening the front cover and the right-hand side cover while referencing the F.S.D. phial and injector. Adjust the thermostat and the hotplate as needed, ensuring proper lighting. Confirm that all systems are functioning correctly before proceeding.

### GRILL CHECK

Ensure the grill is properly sealed with its attached cover. Activate the grill and observe the functionality as you release the control.

### HOTPLATE CHECK

Verify that the crowns of the hotplate are correctly seated. Check each crown by adjusting the hotplate controls and ensuring proper operation upon release.

### LID CUT-OFF DEVICE CHECK

Switch on the hotplate, and check that gas flows to it appropriately. The supply should deactivate if the hotplate is turned off.

### MAIN OVEN CHECK

Set the thermostat to the desired level and verify that it ignites correctly. Ensure the F.S.D. heats adequately, allowing gas supply to the oven. Confirm that operation levels are maintained.

### SECOND OVEN CHECK

Turn the thermostat counterclockwise and activate the button. Confirm that it ignites properly and observe the lighting. Check that gas flows while ensuring the F.S.D. operates effectively.

### GENERAL NOTE

Users should familiarize themselves with the appliance and its components as guided in the manual.
