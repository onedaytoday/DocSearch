### Main Oven Usage Guidelines

**Main Oven Preheating**
The main oven relies on its fan to effectively preheat. It is crucial to preheat the oven to the suggested cooking temperature before starting to cook, as this ensures optimal cooking results.

**Cooking Temperatures**
Always consult the recommended cooking chart for the appropriate temperatures. If necessary, you may adjust the temperature down by 20°C to 25°C for batch baking.

**Operating the Main Oven**
To operate, switch on the oven. Be aware that the light will indicate operational status, and the cooling fan will engage to maintain optimal conditions.

**Adjusting Oven Shelves**
Shelves can be adjusted by lifting them from their current position. They should sit flush along the sides and back of the oven cavity. Proper positioning ensures even cooking performance.

**Tips and Hints**
When arranging items in the oven, try to position them centrally for better heat circulation. Leave adequate spacing between trays to facilitate even cooking and browning. Non-stick, enamel, or heavy materials can enhance browning but should not be placed directly under intense heat sources.

### Oven Cooking Chart

Utilize the cooking chart as a reference for temperature adjustments, which can be increased by 10°C if needed:

- **Food Type** | **Shelf Position** | **Temperature (°C)**
- Bread | Follow Instructions
- Custard Tarts | Follow Instructions
- Meat/Poultry | Follow Instructions

### Roasting Guidelines

Similar to cooking, the roasting chart provides recommended temperatures, generally ranging between 160°C to 180°C depending on the food type. Adjustments can be made for specific needs.

### Defrost Function

The defrost feature is particularly useful for frozen foods, especially those with toppings like icing. To use:
1. Set to the defrost mode.
2. Make sure to monitor the process, as defrosting times can vary based on the food type.

Take precautions to avoid refreezing or cooking foods that have been thawed.

### Care and Cleaning

When cleaning:
- Turn off the oven and allow it to cool.
- Use non-abrasive cleaners avoiding bleach or harsh chemicals.
- Clean the exterior surfaces with a soft, damp cloth to avoid damage.
- For the inner glass, utilize suitable wipes or cloths meant for such surfaces.

**Cleaning Stayclean Surfaces**: These areas can be manually cleaned when heavily soiled to maintain their efficiency.

**Removing Wire Runners**: Safely unhook the wire work from the cavity for thorough cleaning.

### Maintenance of Glass Panels

To clean between the glass panels of the door:
1. Use household cleaners, avoiding abrasives.
2. For outer glass removal, carefully unscrew and clean as needed, ensuring to reassemble securely.

### Bulb Replacement

Should the oven light fail, switch off the electricity supply, allow it to cool, and replace the bulb with a compatible 300°C screw-type bulb.

### Troubleshooting

If issues arise:
1. Confirm power supply and operational status.
2. Check that the unit is functioning in accordance with the instructions.
3. Ensure temperature settings are within the recommended range.
