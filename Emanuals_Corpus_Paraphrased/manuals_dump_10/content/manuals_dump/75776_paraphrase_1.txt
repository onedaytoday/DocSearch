Here is a paraphrase of the provided text in a technical yet natural manner:

The display will activate after a few seconds of inactivity; to override this, press the designated buttons. In scenarios of inactivity, sound notifications will also be deactivated. Pressing the designated button will turn off the high settings. If this adjustment is made, it confirms that the highest level has been acknowledged.

The High Impact Wave-Touch™ and IQ-Touch™ interfaces can be toggled on and off. These features enhance user interaction within the system. For health considerations, it’s essential to monitor the high settings actively. Deactivation occurs once the process is completed, without further adjustment. For any operational queries, refer to http://www.star-k.org.

Note: Ensure proper initiation of all settings, especially when utilizing trays with the IQ-Touch™ interface. Use sufficient force as needed. The Water Cubes and Crushed Ice functionalities offer various options that can be activated by pressing the corresponding buttons for three seconds, which regulates the temperature and conserves energy.

Manual settings can be adjusted by pressing the buttons sequentially for three seconds, catering to user preferences for sound alerts. Factory settings can be restored by pressing the buttons for three seconds to reset both cooling systems and sound alerts. 

Be aware of the cooling touch interface when making adjustments.

Shelves are designed for easy access to fresh foods and can be secured with spacers. Adjust these spacers by rotating them clockwise or counterclockwise to ensure stability. The Luxury-Design™ shelves facilitate the organization and cleaning of items, keeping them fresh and accessible.

For effective use of the Perfect Temperature Drawer (PTD), familiarize yourself with the on/off settings. Initially shipped turned off, adjust the PTD to desired temperatures between 28°F and 42°F by selecting the appropriate settings displayed.

Cleaning practices include ensuring the drawer is detached using a screwdriver and carefully prying to manage the assembly correctly. Do not wash the Perfect Temperature Drawer in a dishwasher or use harsh cleaners.

Lastly, ensure the system remains off during Sabbath/Holidays and when undertaking maintenance tasks to avoid malfunctions. If you experience issues while using the water supply, ensure all connections are secure and check for blockage.

**Ice Water Caution**  
**IMPORTANT: DO NOT rotate or turn the unit**. Ensure the crushed ice function aligns properly. If it isn’t functioning correctly, food items may not be adequately stored. Check the water filter light located at the top right of the fresh food compartment every month. This should be replaced at least every six months, or when the light prompts you to do so.

**Water Filter Information**  
The PureAdvantage™ Water Filter (EWF01) has been tested and certified by NSF International for specific contaminant reduction. It is crucial to flush the system by turning on the water supply for three seconds before use.

**Food Placement Guidelines**  
Avoid overcrowding the shelves, as this inhibits air circulation and cooling efficiency. Store meat separately from other foods to prevent cross-contamination. Consider using airtight containers to keep food fresh and prevent freezer burn.

While in operation, you might hear typical high-efficiency noises, including water flow or the defrost heater, which may click or hiss. These sounds indicate that the refrigerator is working as intended.

**Vacations**  
If you plan to leave for an extended period, turn off the cooling function and ensure all food items are removed.
