### Basic Tools Required
- Screwdriver
- Measuring Tape

**Warning:** The cabinet and internal components may have sharp edges; exercise caution during installation or servicing to avoid injury.

### Air Cleaner Functionality
The air cleaner operates by allowing air to flow through an initial section (A), where larger particles are trapped. Air continues to a charged section (B), where particles receive an electric charge before moving to the collecting section (C). Here, particles are attracted to collecting plates and removed from the air supply.

### Air Cleaner Construction
The air cleaner attaches to existing ductwork, containing sections for air collection and filtration. Each section is equipped with electrical connections and indicators for operational status, including high-voltage connections.

### Pre-Installation Guidelines
To locate the air filter:
- Select a suitable position based on the forced-air system's specifications.
- Ensure a minimum clearance of several inches for proper airflow and access.

**Note:** If a transition section is included, it must be appropriately sized to maintain airflow.

**Air Flow Direction:** The unit is typically configured for left-to-right airflow, but can be adjusted to accommodate right-to-left flow.

### Installation Instructions
1. **Remove and Dispose of the Old Filter**  
   Before installing, clean the blower compartment.

2. **Mount the Unit**  
   Ensure the cleaner is positioned correctly in relation to the heating or cooling system.

3. **Secure Connections**  
   Fasten the unit and ensure all connections align with the system specifications.

### Wiring Instructions
Wiring must be completed in accordance with electrical codes to prevent serious hazards. Ensure appropriate connections for power supply and blower operation. 

### Operation
Once powered, switch the cleaner on. An operational sound or arcing may occasionally occur, which is normal. Monitor the operational light; if it remains off, this could indicate a malfunction that requires troubleshooting.

### Maintenance Recommendations
Inspect the air cleaner monthly for performance. Clean as necessary, using standard household cleaning procedures.

**Cleaning the Cells:**  
1. Turn the unit off.
2. Carefully remove cells for cleaning. 
3. Allow cleaned components to dry fully before reassembly.

### Power Supply Checkout Procedure

1. Switch the power to the OFF position and disconnect the insulated lead from the chassis.
2. Connect the high lead to the AC back cover, then turn the switch to the ON position.
3. If the indicator light illuminates and reads a positive VDC, the power supply is functioning correctly.
4. Ensure the insulated lead is positioned upwards and select a multimeter setting that shows VDC with the probe attached.
5. If there is any indication of low VDC, inspect for damaged components such as bowed, bent, or loose wires and cracked insulators.
6. If the indicator light does not turn ON, check the supply to ensure a proper flow of energy.
