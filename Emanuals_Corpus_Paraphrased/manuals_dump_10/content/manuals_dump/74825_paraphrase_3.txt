### Food Storage Guidelines for LONGFRESH 0°C

To maintain the quality of food stored in the LONGFRESH 0°C compartment, it is essential to follow proper storage practices. Foods should be packed correctly and can include fresh items as well as other products that are suitable for this temperature.

**Storage Duration:**
- Items like seafood and cooked meats can typically last up to three months.
- Fresh fruits and vegetables, such as pears, peaches, and radishes, should also be stored without cooking, ensuring they remain in optimal condition.
  
**Packaging:**
- Foods should be tightly wrapped or stored in airtight containers to preserve freshness. Items left uncovered may spoil faster.
- Ensure that food is spaced adequately to allow airflow and prevent freezing issues.

**Temperature Control:**
- The LONGFRESH 0°C setting is designed to keep items at an optimal cooling temperature, helping maintain their quality and extend shelf life.
- The FROSTMATIC function should be activated when storing large amounts of food, as it will ensure rapid cooling and protect the quality of items already stored.

**Operating Functions:**
- To switch the unit on or off, press the ON/OFF button. If the function is set to FROSTMATIC, it typically runs for a specific duration before automatically shutting off.
- The display will indicate the current temperature (ACTUAL) and the desired settings (DESIRED). Flashes denote changes, and you should use the corresponding buttons (J or L) to adjust as necessary.

**Defrosting and Maintenance:**
- Regularly clean the appliance, especially the AIR FILTER, to prevent any electrical issues and maintain airflow.
- Frost build-up should be monitored; if it becomes excessive, defrosting the unit is recommended to ensure efficient operation.

**Safety Precautions:**
- Avoid exposure to high temperatures and ensure that storage times are respected to minimize spoilage.
- Be cautious while handling food items and use protective measures when cleaning to avoid potential electrical shock.

By adhering to these guidelines, the freshness and safety of your stored foods can be effectively maintained within the LONGFRESH 0°C environment.
