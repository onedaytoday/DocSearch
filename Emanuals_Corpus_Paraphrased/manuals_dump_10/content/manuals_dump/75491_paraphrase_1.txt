### Convection Cooking Instructions

In convection cooking, food is heated in a preheated oven where hot air circulates around it, allowing it to cook evenly. This method permits cooking on multiple shelves simultaneously. The top shelf can use heat from both the top and bottom, which is especially useful for cooking meats. For best results with thicker cuts of meat, it’s important to lightly season them and place them farther from the heat source to avoid burning or uneven cooking. 

Cooking temperatures vary: typical ranges for meat are around 200-250°C while other foods might be cooked at 150-175°C. The recommended cooking times should be adhered to, with guidance provided in the tables below concerning specific food types and their corresponding cooking durations.
