**Instructions Regarding Operation and Safety**

Ensure that the food is stored at the appropriate temperature continuously. Exposure to frost may affect the food’s quality; thus, immediate action is required. The symptom of excessive cold may render food unfit for consumption within a few hours. Ensure that the appliance is airtight to maintain proper heating. If the thermostat appears unresponsive, adjust it to a warmer setting temporarily. Refer to the 'Starting and Regulation' section for specific instructions.

**Warning: Electrical Hazards!** 

To prevent electric shocks, turn off the light switch and disconnect the power supply. To deactivate the thermostat, remove the screw securing the light cover. Press the light cover as indicated and pull it back. Reattach the light cover and secure it with the screw.

You may notice clicks as the switches are engaged or disengaged. A humming sound indicates normal operational flow, whereas splashing sounds may be heard when the unit is turned off.
