**IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION**  
This manual should be kept for reference. If the appliance is transferred to another party, it is essential that they receive this instruction booklet to understand the functionality and safety information. This equipment is heavy, so exercise caution while moving it. Ensure that the power supply is disconnected, especially when servicing. The appliance should not be exposed to heat sources or direct sunlight for prolonged periods. Always ensure that the back of the unit is ventilated as per the instructions provided. 

When in use, allow the appliance several hours to cool down adequately, particularly when loading fresh food. It should be positioned away from heating elements or boilers. Avoid storing items directly against the inside walls to prevent frost or freezer burn. Only use containers specifically designed for food storage.

**Cleaning and Defrosting**  
Before cleaning, always disconnect the power supply. The inner surfaces should be cleaned gently to avoid damage. Do not use detergents, abrasive cleaners, or scented cleaning products, as these might harm the surface or leave odors. If the appliance light fails, turn off the power, and then replace the bulb following the instructions provided.

The defrosting process must be regularly undertaken when frost builds up. If frost exceeds a certain thickness, turn off the thermostat and follow the recommended defrosting procedure, ensuring to remove any perishable items beforehand.

**Operation and Maintenance**  
To maintain optimal performance, set the thermostat appropriately based on the ambient temperature and the types of food being stored. Fresh food should not be refrozen once thawed; instead, use it within a few hours of thawing. Monitor the sound and operational behavior of the appliance, acknowledging that some noises are normal during operation.
