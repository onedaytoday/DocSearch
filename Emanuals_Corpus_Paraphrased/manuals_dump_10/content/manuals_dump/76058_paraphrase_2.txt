## Important Guidelines for Assembly and Product Use

**Storage and Service**  
Products must be stored upright to ensure proper assembly and functionality. Maintain the rating plate and service information for any future inquiries or servicing. Please retain information regarding your product's warranty as well.

**Safety Precautions**  
To minimize the risk of electrical shock, please adhere to the following:  
- Always turn off the switch before servicing or when not in use.
- Use the vacuum only with the recommended attachments; avoid using it as a toy.
- Ensure cords are kept clear of heated surfaces to prevent damage.
- Avoid using the cleaner in wet conditions or near flammable materials such as matches or ashes.

**Operations and Maintenance**  
Always read all instructions before operating your wet pickup vacuum cleaner. To address clogs, refer to the service information and contact your Authorized Warranty Station if necessary. For inquiries in North America, reach out to Consumer Service.

**Additional Instructions**  
- Do not apply oil to the appliance as it is constructed to be permanently sealed.
- The built-in thermal thermostat prevents overheating. If the unit shuts off due to overheating, turn off the switch and allow it to cool down before use.
- If any hose or accessory appears damaged, discontinue use immediately to prevent further issues.

**Assembly Procedures**  
When assembling, ensure the cover is aligned and properly secured. The attachment points for screws can be found on the cover; rotate as needed. 

**Micron Filter Maintenance**  
Regularly inspect the Micron components, ensuring they are clean and unobstructed for optimal performance. 

**Troubleshooting**  
If you encounter issues such as reduced suction, check for clogs in the hose. Both the operation height and hose connections should be adjusted as necessary to ensure efficient cleaning.

Please follow all safety guidelines and operational parameters to maintain the longevity and effectiveness of your appliance. Save these instructions for future reference.
