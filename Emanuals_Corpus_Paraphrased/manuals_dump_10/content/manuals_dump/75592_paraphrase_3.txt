**10GN1/1 Chilling Process Overview:**

The chilling process involves reducing the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly decreasing bacterial levels within a four-hour period before further lowering it to -18°C. This method effectively preserves food quality over several months while adhering to proper chilling and freezing protocols.

**Operational Modes:**

The appliance features various operational modes, including Soft Chilling (-2°C) and Shock Freezing (-20°C). The systems can handle continuous operation and comply with NF and UK regulations, incorporating built-in UV accessories and defrost mechanisms. A countdown display provides service information up to +32°C. 

Once -14°C is achieved during the temporary holding phase, the temperature can drop to -36°C or as low as -40°C, with continuous monitoring ensuring compliance with HACCP standards, even if operations are interrupted.

**Technical Specifications:**

- **Chilling Efficiency:** Capable of chilling food from +90°C to +3°C within four hours.
- **Construction:** Comprised of AISI stainless steel with high-density polyurethane insulation.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meets productivity and chilling standards outlined by NF and UK regulations.

**Included Accessories:**

- 3-Sensor Probe for Chiller and Freezer
- Tray Racks and Banquet Racks for varying capacities
- Remote Units for additional cooling options
- HACCP Monitoring Kits and Accessories for enhanced hygiene compliance
- Various racks and trolleys designed with specific pitches for organized storage

**Environmental Considerations:**

Insulation is HCFC-free, ensuring low environmental impact. The equipment features an IP20 protection rating, facilitating cleaning while conserving energy and thermal performance.

**Installation and Certification:**

The appliance must be plumbed for optimal operation and is certified by AFAQ AFNOR for compliance with hygiene standards (NF031).
