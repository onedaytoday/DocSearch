**SST Operating Manual Overview**

This manual pertains to the SST models—SST1000, SST1400, SST1600, and SST2000—produced by White-Rodgers, a division of Emerson. It includes essential safety rules and operational guidelines for installation and service. Users should consult this manual to ensure safe handling, reduce performance risks, and avoid hazardous situations during operation and maintenance.

**Safety Precautions**
- Always ensure power is disconnected before servicing to prevent electrocution.
- Use appropriate tools and follow the manufacturer's instructions to prevent personal injury and equipment malfunction.
- Be mindful of sharp edges in the cabinets and cells during installation and servicing.

**Air Cleaner Operation**
The air cleaner operates by drawing air through multiple sections, where particulates are captured. The process involves charging particles in section (A), collecting them in section (B), and then further filtering in section (C). The design includes interchangeable plates that attract and trap airborne contaminants efficiently. The cleaned air is then circulated back into the environment.

**Installation Guidelines**
- Choose a mounting location that allows sufficient airflow and access for maintenance.
- The installation requires clearance specific to each model (SST1000, SST1400, SST1600, and SST2000) to ensure optimal performance.
- Follow the airflow direction indicated for each model to avoid inefficiency.

**Typical Mounting Configurations**
- The air cleaner can be installed in various positions based on the furnace type (e.g., basement, highboy, or horizontal).
- Ensure that the cleaner is mounted securely and in accordance with the specified flow direction to maintain operational effectiveness.

This manual aims to provide clear instructions for the safe and effective use of SST air cleaners, ensuring their longevity and performance. For detailed specifications and additional resources, please visit www.white-rodgers.com.

**Installation Instructions**

1. **Remove and Dispose of Old Filter**: Ensure that the old filter is removed and properly discarded.

2. **Clean the Blower Compartment**: It is essential to clean both the blower and the blower housing. For maintenance, refer to the typical setup of the Highboy unit.

3. **Location Alignment**: When repositioning components, ensure that all parts are aligned as per their relative locations for optimal functionality. If needed, adjust the positioning to ensure a proper fit.

4. **Mounting**: Securely mount all components, normally referencing the correct orientation for each part. 

5. **Ducting Setup**: An optional outward duct section may be added as needed, ensuring that airflow is efficient and compliant with system specifications.

**Wiring Instructions**

- Ensure that all wiring adheres to safety standards and is connected securely. Pay particular attention to grounding to prevent hazards.

- Should there be any discrepancies with the flow, ensure the circuit is properly grounded and wired according to local electrical codes to avoid serious risks.

**Operation Instructions**

1. **Power On**: Toggle the ON-OFF switch to ON. Verify if the blower operates correctly, listening for unusual sounds, which might indicate issues.

2. **Indicator Light**: If the light does not illuminate, check connections or service requirements, as this may indicate operational issues.

**Maintenance Instructions**

- Regularly inspect the unit for sharp edges and maintain safety precautions when servicing.

- Cleaning is recommended every month or more frequently based on usage. Clean the cells as required by turning off the power.

- Ensure all components are uncluttered and properly secured before resuming operation.

**Replacing an Ionizing Wire**

To replace the ionizing wire, follow the clear sequence for removal and installation, ensuring that all connections are secure.

**Specifications**

Refer to the specifications for various models including capacities and electrical ratings for optimal performance and compliance.

**Service Guidance**

For service-related issues, rely on authorized technicians to ensure safety and compliance with the equipment's operational standards.

**POWER SUPPLY CHECKOUT PROCEDURE**

1. Switch the power to the OFF position and disconnect the flow switch and cover.
2. Connect the three-pin flow switch (white to white-brown wire) as illustrated.
3. Ensure the wires from the switch are insulated and securely connected to the chassis and the high voltage AC.
4. Turn the switch ON.
5. If the indicator light turns ON and shows the appropriate VDC supply, verify that it is functioning correctly. 
6. If the light is OFF, check for any issues with the flow switch and replace any necessary components.

**AIR FLOW MONITOR TEST**

1. Apply VAC to the supply terminals with the switch ON. 
2. Activate the thermistor by blowing on it. 
3. After a few seconds, check for flow at the switch and cover. 
4. If the flow appears normal, the system should be operational; if not, diagnose further.

**OZONE REDUCTION INFORMATION**

Ozone reduction cleaners may vary in effectiveness depending on the design. Ensure that the systems align with established safety standards.

**ELECTRONIC AIR CLEANER RETROFIT KITS INSTALLATION**

Follow installation instructions carefully. This includes:
- Connecting the components correctly as shown, ensuring a proper ground connection through the necessary hardware.
- Wiring must adhere to the provided guidelines for safe operation. 

**PARTS LIST FOR ELECTRONIC AIR CLEANERS**

Refer to the list for part numbers and descriptions associated with various models. Ensure you have the correct items to facilitate repairs or replacements.
