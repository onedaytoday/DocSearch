### Counters Overview

**Design and Construction**  
The counters are strategically located beneath. They are constructed from high-quality AISI materials, designed to the highest standards. These counters include integrated components for optimal temperature control, with a temperature range of 2°C to +10°C.

**Installation and Operation**  
Installation is straightforward, with the units operating efficiently at temperatures up to 43°C. 

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
The AISI construction features rounded corners to facilitate easy cleaning. Additionally, they are designed for quick access for maintenance, allowing front access for repairs.

**Environmental Considerations**  
The insulation adheres to CFC-free and HCFC-free standards, utilizing cyclopenthane with thicknesses that comply with ISO guidelines, ensuring environmental safety.
