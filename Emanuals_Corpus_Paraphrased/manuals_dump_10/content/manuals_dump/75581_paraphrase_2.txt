The refrigeration system comprises coolers designed to operate within a temperature range of -2 to +8°C. These units feature varying thicknesses and include either built-in or external insulation. Constructed with pre-charged refrigeration systems and high-quality materials, they utilize new injection technology for improved performance. All insulation is pre-painted and adheres to CFC and HCFC-free standards. The interiors have rounded corners to facilitate cleaning.

Fast-fit components enable easy assembly and installation. The coolers are designed for high efficiency and feature airtight PVC to minimize leaks. They can function in ambient temperatures up to +43°C and are compatible with refrigerants R404A, providing high and low-temperature performance.

Defrosting is managed via a heated system designed to reduce ice build-up, and the units also include internal lighting. Specifications feature an IP54 rating, an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting switch, and a thermostat. The right-hinged doors are equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges that ensure airtight closure, enhancing insulation and operational efficiency.

The refrigeration system also meets HACCP standards and requires various accessories for optimal use. Key technical specifications include height and electrical supply details, while available accessories encompass aluminum shelving, door microswitches, graphic temperature recorder kits, advanced HACCP connection kits, plastic curtains for doors, and printers for recording temperatures.

This model range includes various configurations such as CR24N100R, CR20N117R, and CR28N117R, alongside other variants.
