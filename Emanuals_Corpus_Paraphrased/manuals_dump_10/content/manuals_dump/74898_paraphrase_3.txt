**General Operations**  
To begin, release the designated buttons for a few seconds. While the display indicates the current settings, monitor the operation as described. The system will produce sounds in response to button interactions. 

**Automatic Start**  
Ensure the electricity supply is activated, and verify the display reflects the status. Adjust cooking hours as necessary; the system will increase cooking time accordingly. If the desired setting is achieved, release the buttons. The AUTO function is to be completed within seconds of initiating the cooking process. 

**System Functions**  
Be aware that the system will flash notifications as required. The AUTO feature adjusts to the set cooking hours, while displaying active settings. Follow the instructions to properly utilize the appliance. 

**Grill Overview**  
Caution: Accessible surfaces may become hot during grill operation; keep children away. The grill can operate over the entirety or a specific section for cooking various foods. Enable the dual grill feature by selecting the function and adjusting the temperature as needed (110°C or 150°C). 

**Grilling Process**  
Always keep the grill door open during use to ensure proper temperature regulation. Monitor the status, as indicators will signal readiness. Ensure the grill pan and handle are configured correctly. Adjust the height of the food to allow for effective cooking.

**Cooking Guidelines**  
Food should be thoroughly cooked; lightly oiling can enhance performance. Preheat for optimal results, especially for items like toast or cakes. Turn food appropriately to achieve an even cooking surface. Specific cooking charts are available for reference.

**Top Oven Functionality**  
The top oven provides focused heat for baking and can efficiently manage low-temperature recipes (100°C to 90°C). Set the appropriate function and ensure proper shelf fitting to avoid issues. 

**Fan Oven Efficiency**  
To effectively preheat the fan oven, the correct cooking temperature should be observed, typically 20–25°C less than standard settings. Use the batch system for multiple items, adjusting shelf placement to optimize airflow.

**Oven Cooking Ecosystem**  
Refer to the specific cooking charts for accurate temperature settings, ensuring to space dishes adequately. Maintain an organized setup to facilitate even cooking and browning.

**Roasting Mechanics**  
Follow the roasting chart to select temperatures and cooking times based on meat types. Ensure sufficient clearance to avoid any obstruction during operation.

**Defrosting Functionality**  
Access the defrost feature for optimal thawing conditions, particularly for meats. Maintain food safety by observing recommended thawing times and ensuring complete thawing before cooking.

**Food Safety Tips**  
When purchasing and preparing food, adhere to safety standards to minimize bacterial risks during handling and storage. Always ensure meat is fully thawed and cooked immediately post-defrosting to maintain quality.
