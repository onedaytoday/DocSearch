To securely mount the system, ensure that it is properly fastened at the intended location, whether itâ€™s deployed or retracted. This will prevent any damage during use. Refer to www.elitescreens.com for detailed mounting instructions, including positioning the screws approximately one inch from the intended center. Utilize the provided chains and ensure correct alignment with the designated mounting ears.

When the screen is retracted, it should remain within its housing to avoid strain or external interference. Follow the warranty guidelines to maintain coverage, and take care when cleaning the unit. It's advisable to retract the screen before maintenance for optimal performance.

Height specifications and aspect ratios are critical. Refer to various models for precise measurements. Each model (e.g., M71S, M85S, M99S) has specific height and aspect ratio details outlined in the product documentation.

Warranty coverage spans 90 days for refurbished units and includes specific conditions for GEMR purchases. For warranty claims, an RMA authorization is necessary to process returns. Unauthorized returns or items received without an RMA will not be accepted.
