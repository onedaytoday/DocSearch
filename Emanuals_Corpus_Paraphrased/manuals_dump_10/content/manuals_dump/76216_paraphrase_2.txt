**Paraphrased Text:**

Whether PM Black is chosen or not is irrelevant in this context. TRADITIONAL POWDERS can be applied directly to clothes, whereas TRADITIONAL LIQUIDS should be dispensed as instructed, preferably at the top and back compartment of the washing machine. COMPACT POWDERS AND LIQUIDS operate similarly; follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for both formulations. FABRIC CONDITIONERS can enhance the performance of easy-care fabrics.

For optimal use, ensure to adhere to the specific washing machine models and follow their instructions accordingly. MAX Bounce sheets are recommended for optimal results.

When using the PM Black washing machine, ensure you can switch between options, such as SOAK, STAIN-Action, or no spin, by properly selecting from the visible lights corresponding to your chosen settings. The machine indicates the selected phase through illuminated lights.

The display will show which option has been chosen, and the washing cycle can begin by pressing the START/PAUSE button. If the RINSE HOLD is selected, respective indicator lights will show, and a countdown will commence. Other options include DELAY START, which requires pressing the button to begin the countdown.

To modify or reset the cycle at any time, utilize the START/PAUSE button, and the relevant indicator lights will indicate the current phase. If there are errors displayed, troubleshoot accordingly, such as checking the water supply (E10) or ensuring the door is securely closed (E40).

For cleaning and maintenance, regularly check the machine’s hoses and filters. Should the hoses become blocked or require cleaning, disconnect them carefully, clean as needed, and reconnect properly to avoid leaks.

If you encounter whistling or malfunctioning sounds from the machine, refer to the troubleshooting guide. It’s crucial to ensure the machine is set correctly and all hose connections are secure.

For water temperature settings, refer to the provided chart, ensuring you select the appropriate temperature for different fabric types. If you experience poor washing results, ensure that the correct settings are chosen and that the load isn’t overloaded.
