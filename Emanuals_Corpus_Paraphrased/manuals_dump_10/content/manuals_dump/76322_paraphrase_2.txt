It appears that the original text is highly structured technical content related to the washing and care of fabrics, possibly from an appliance manual. The text includes instructions about washing various types of fabrics, using bleach, and proper machine settings.

Here’s a paraphrased version with clear technical details:

---

For cleaning fabrics, apply the appropriate cloth and grease management techniques. Use bleach selectively for both whites and colored items, ensuring a light application. When treating stains like lipstick, apply bleach with caution, especially on whites. Be aware that the type of fabric influences the choice of additives and their effectiveness, particularly when washing at higher temperatures (up to 60°C). Prewashing may be necessary depending on the selected fabric type.

Refer to the section regarding the recommended washing temperatures: everyday items can typically be washed at 30°C to 60°C, while delicates may require lower settings. The machine's water classification should be checked to ensure it meets the required standards.

For drying, adjust the settings to suit the fabric type, whether tumbling or air drying. Remember to clean the lint filter regularly and inspect for any blockages. When performing maintenance, ensure the appliance is disconnected from power before performing any clean-up or repairs.

When addressing operational errors, such as those indicated by flashing lights or acoustic signals, follow the troubleshooting guidelines. Problems like blocked hoses or improper settings may lead to performance issues.

If washing fabrics at temperatures below 0°C, take precautions to avoid damage. Emergency emptying procedures should be followed if necessary, ensuring that the machine is powered down before attempting to clear any blockages.

Always consult the technical information available on the rating plate and maintain proper installation standards to ensure optimal performance. Be sure to check the positioning of hoses and connections to prevent leaks or operational difficulties.

Here’s a paraphrased version of your text, maintaining its technical meaning:

The hose in question is threaded and has been extended. If necessary, it is advisable to acquire this specific type of hose. The hose should be connected for proper operation. The water supply should be plumbed accordingly. There are guidelines to follow regarding installation. For internal connections, ensure that their orientation is correct—especially at the hose's outlet. 

Warnings indicate that carpeting should not cover the hose, and care should be taken to avoid any breakdowns or malfunctions, particularly with dishwashers that require treatment for foul water. For electrical safety, it’s essential to switch off the power supply before making any connections. Ensure that the power cord adheres to the specified rating, as indicated on its rating plate. 

The colored wires should be connected as follows: the Earth wire (green/yellow) should be connected to the earth terminal, the Neutral wire (blue) should connect to the 'N' terminal, and the Live wire (brown or red) should link to the 'L' terminal. There’s a warning about potential electrical shock; therefore, any faults should be addressed by Service Force.
