The mounting procedure should ensure that the screen remains secure whether it is retracted or deployed, reflecting its intended location. To install the Screen Mount on the wall, identify the appropriate position, and use the supplied screws—typically located about an inch from the mount’s edge. Ensure that the back and right parts of the Mount are correctly positioned as per the installation guidelines provided on www.elitescreens.com.

The SLOW RETRACT MECHANISM (SRM) allows the screen to lower and retract smoothly without manual interference. If the screen is forced or improperly handled, it may lead to issues. Clean the housing with a soft cloth to maintain its condition.
