Cleaning and additive recommendations vary based on fabric type and wash cycle. For whites and colored fabrics, it's essential to follow appropriate washing instructions, particularly when using non-biological cleansers like Fairy. Delicate items often require specialized care, with specific bleach formulations for colored fabrics. Stain removers such as Vanish and GloWhite are advisable for heavily stained items.

Traditional powders and liquids, whether directly applied or measured using specific appliances, should adhere to recommended dosages. Fabric conditioners are beneficial for maintaining softness and should be used following machine instructions.

It's critical to avoid mixing incompatible fabrics during washing due to fire hazards. Replicate the recommended drying process based on fabric type, as outlined in the accompanying chart. Use the START/PAUSE function appropriately for various fabric loads, ensuring towels and other items are consistently cleaned. 

Warnings include avoiding prolonged washing times to prevent creasing. For stain treatments, utilize prewash options cautiously and restart cycles when necessary. The DELAY START feature allows for subsequent activation of the washing process.

In case of malfunctions (indicated by flashing lights), follow troubleshooting protocols for common errors such as E10 (water supply issues) or E40 (door not securely closed). Ensure hoses are properly connected to avoid clogs and operational issues.

For drying, follow guidelines based on item types. The cycles for different fabrics (e.g., whites, synthetics) should be noted, with specific temperatures and durations indicated. Proper maintenance of the washing machine and following cleaning protocols will ensure optimal performance and longevity.
