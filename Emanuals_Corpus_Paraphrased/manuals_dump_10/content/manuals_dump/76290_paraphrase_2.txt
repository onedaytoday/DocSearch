Ensure that the dishes are thoroughly cleaned using appropriate cleaning products, and wipe down surfaces with a cloth. For detailed cleaning, particularly in corners and crevices, utilize a toothbrush. Regular inspection of components is essential, and any maintenance should follow specific guidelines. 

If required, allow the unit to cool before releasing the emptying hose. Disconnect the hose from its attachment at the rear and place it securely back in position. Turn off the water supply before unscrewing the hose. When reattaching it, ensure it is secured properly. If the unit requires emergency emptying, follow the outlined procedure and ensure that the food waste is cooled to below 0°C to prevent blockages and damage. 

For recurring issues with the emptying hose, check for clogs and clean as necessary. If problems persist, consider contacting service for assistance. Utilize proper cleaning solutions and adhere to the manufacturer's guidelines for the best results.
