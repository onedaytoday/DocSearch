**Product Selection and Usage Instructions**

Whether users opt for traditional powders or liquids often depends on their personal choices. Traditional powders should be applied directly to clothing, while traditional liquids can be used immediately according to the measured guidelines provided. Compact powders and liquids must be used following specific instructions, which dictate their application on both the top and back of the washer. Fabric conditioners are available to enhance the performance of easy-care fabrics.

The washer's fabric types range and should be selected accordingly. Users should refer to the manufacturer’s instructions, especially when using conditioning sheets like MAX Bounce. These sheets simplify the laundry process.

For pre-soaking or stain treatment, the STAIN-Action setting must not exceed the maximum limits. Switching on and off is indicated through flashing lights on the console. The light displays correspond to the phase currently selected, including options for spin speed or no spin at all.

To start the selected cycle, press the START/PAUSE button, which will then illuminate the associated phase light. Any chosen options will begin their countdown, which may vary in hours depending on the selected settings. If the rinse hold option is enabled, the indicator will reflect this status until the end of the cycle.

**Washing Guidelines**

Refer to the washing chart that categorizes fabrics such as whites, colored items, and easy-care materials. Each category will have specific temperature settings, such as 60°C for heavily soiled items. Additional functions include stain removal, quick prewash, extra rinse, rinse hold, and customized spin speeds for different fabric types.

**Maintenance Instructions**

For optimal performance, regular cleaning is essential. This includes cleaning the recess area with a toothbrush and ensuring that threads and debris are cleared. The drain hose may require unscrewing and cleaning, especially if any blockages occur.

**Troubleshooting**

If unusual sounds or errors arise, such as E10 (indicating water supply issues) or E20 (problems related to rinsing), consult the troubleshooting guide. Ensure all hatches are closed and connections are secure. If necessary, reset the system and restart.

**Warranty and Service Information**

For any service inquiries, AEG Service Force should be contacted for assistance. Detailed information can be located at their website or through direct telephone communication; this includes all warranty details and service options available.
