To deactivate the FROSTMATIC function, press the ON/OFF button for several seconds. The function will switch off after a countdown period. If the FROSTMATIC has been triggered, an indicator light will flash and sound an alert when the temperature reaches a critical high. It's crucial to manually turn off the function after introducing fresh food, and the interior of the freezer should be cleaned regularly to prevent frost buildup. Frost should be removed when it becomes excessive, which can impact efficiency. Warning: Never use harsh chemicals on the exterior; clean only with recommended methods. 

For food safety, allow freshly cooked items to cool before placing them in the freezer, and ensure containers are not tightly sealed to prevent explosion under pressure. During the freezing process, some foods may form ice or frost, which must be monitored and managed. 

If you notice any malfunctions or if the operational lights behave unexpectedly, such as the Frostmatic light being continuously illuminated, please contact the AEG Service Force. The FROSTMATIC feature is designed to rapidly freeze fresh food while maintaining quality. Always follow the recommended guidelines for optimal performance and safety.
