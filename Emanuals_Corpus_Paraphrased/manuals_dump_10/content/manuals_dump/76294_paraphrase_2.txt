The hose is equipped with a threaded connection. It is compatible with standard hoses. The other end of the hose, which can be turned to adjust its position, is labeled as AL013, indicating that the hose has been extended. If the hose is excessively long, you may need to purchase a specific type, such as P0021, designed for this purpose. The configuration allows for proper attachment to the mouth of the hose, ensuring optimal functionality.

IMPORTANT: The maximum pressure rating of the hose must be adhered to (as indicated). Twisting the hose improperly may lead to issues. It is crucial to identify the appropriate rating, especially if referring to P0254, which denotes the specified capacity (as marked on the plate adjacent to the outlet). Ensure that the hose operates at the indicated rating without any intermediary modifications. Additionally, the outlet should include security earthing. The use of grounding in these contexts is essential.

Regarding product choices, when cleaning and maintaining equipment such as cleaners, chains, and mowers, ensure that each item meets local standards and regulations, with prices potentially exceeding USD depending on the country of purchase.
