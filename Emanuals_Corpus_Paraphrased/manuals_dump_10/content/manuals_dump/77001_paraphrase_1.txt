# OPERATION PROCEDURES

### Powering On
To initiate operation, activate the switch. Ensure the switch is fully engaged. If the switch is turned on and off immediately, wait a few seconds before attempting to turn it on again. For focusing, press the [TELE/WIDE] buttons for either the manual or wireless operation. To adjust focus, use the [AUTO FOCUS] button located at the front or the [AF] button for remote operation. The [TELE] function adjusts the height when the corresponding component is attached, as demonstrated on the right.

### Storing the Visual Presenter
To store the visual presenter, switch it off. Adjust the lighting as shown on the right until it is properly set. If there are additional lighting configurations, make adjustments as necessary (e.g., light (R) and light (L)). The head may need to be angled slightly backward during this process. When transporting, apply appropriate force to the head to avoid damage.

### Various Functions

1. **Lighting Control**:
   - The lighting can be managed via the [LAMP] button, either manually or wirelessly.
   - Pressing this button activates the lights on both sides; releasing it turns them off. Refer to OSD P.22 for detailed operation.
   
2. **Focus Adjustments**:
   - Activate the autofocus by pressing either the [AUTO FOCUS] button on the front or the [AF] button remotely.
   - Once the focus is acquired, it remains unchanged until revised manually. This can also be switched to a one-shot focus mode for specific needs.

3. **Optical Adjustments**:
   - Use the [NEAR] or [FAR] buttons for optical adjustments, available through the remote control. This feature is particularly useful for enhancing 3-D presentations.
   - The iris settings can be modified using the [OPEN] and [CLOSE] buttons for brightness control.

### Communication via RS-232C
To connect the PC via RS-232C, ensure the settings are aligned as shown. Use the provided switches to manage the connection. The protocol allows for bidirectional communication, where the PC can receive instructive commands that facilitate operations.

### RS-232C Command Specifications
The commands sent and received through RS-232C are essential for operation. For instance, acknowledgments are returned to indicate command success. Command formats include text indicators for particular functions such as lighting adjustments and color selections.

### Troubleshooting
If the device is not operating correctly:
- Ensure it is properly connected to the AC power supply.
- Check if the TELE or WIDE options are appropriately configured.
- Confirm that the equipment has had enough preheating time.
- For persistent issues, consider contacting authorized support. 

For further assistance, refer to the relevant sections of the operational manual.
