### Performance Features

**Quality:** The BDP-05FD delivers a maximum resolution of 1920x1080 for exceptional picture clarity. With True 24 FPS, viewers can experience films exactly as envisioned by their creators. This player is designed to transmit both HD audio and video signals to your HDMI-compatible A/V receiver or HD flat panel. Unlike standard connections, HDMI consolidates multiple cables into one without compromising signal integrity. HDMI 1.3a also supports 12-bit deep color, enhancing subtle color gradations.

**HDMI Control:** The BDP-05FD enables comprehensive control of all your HDMI Control-enabled Pioneer A/V equipment through a single interface, facilitated by high-performance Wolfson DACs, which boast a signal-to-noise ratio of 117 dB, providing superior audio fidelity for music and movie soundtracks.

**Jitter Reduction:** Utilizing a Pioneer-engineered IC, the audio clock waveform is digitally reshaped to significantly minimize jitter across all content. PQLS technology ensures jitter-free audio transmission from CD sources when connected to SC-05 or SC-07 Elite Receivers.

**Touch Controls:** The system features elegant, fully integrated touch-sensitive controls unique to Elite Blu-ray Disc Players. By adjusting the low-pass filter, the waveform distortion of the coaxial digital output is noticeably reduced.

**Image Enhancement:** The BDP-05FD offers advanced image processing features, including Motion, Pure Cinema, and various noise reduction options (YNR, CNR, BNR, MNR). It employs a pixel-by-pixel strategy to diminish Gaussian noise while preserving image clarity. The player can also independently process high-definition video streams, allowing you to watch Blu-ray movies while simultaneously accessing bonus features via Picture-in-Picture.

**Audio Format Compatibility:** For users with non-HDMI receivers or preamps, the BDP-05FD includes internal decoding for advanced audio formats such as Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD High Resolution, and DTS-HD Master Audio. The player can output bitstream audio for these formats through the HDMI connection.

**User Interface:** The BDP-05FD features an Advanced Unified Graphic Interface (GUI) for straightforward setup and operation, which is also consistent across its latest Elite Receivers and Plasma Displays for seamless user experience. *Future firmware upgrades may enhance compatibility.
