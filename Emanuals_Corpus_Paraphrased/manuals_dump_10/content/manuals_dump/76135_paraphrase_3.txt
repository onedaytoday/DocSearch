### DE CHDE and Instructions

**User Guidance for Appliance Operation**

This text outlines critical instructions regarding the appliance, particularly addressing issues related to the charcoal greaser’s operation and self-ignition risks associated with grease buildup. The heat source may cause overheating if the top of the cooker is not regularly maintained and cleaned.

**Safety and Compliance**

To ensure compliance with local building regulations, it's crucial that the appliance is connected safely to a ventilation system suitable for combustion devices, such as room heaters. Users must adhere strictly to the recommendations set forth by local authorities and the appliance manufacturer.

**Operational Specifications**

Proper installation and venting are vital to the appliance's performance. Installation should involve a direct outlet hose that follows basic instructions to avoid performance issues and minimize fire hazards.

**Cleaning Instructions**

It is important to clean the grease filter regularly, ideally after every few hours of operation, using high-temperature water (at least 65°C) and appropriate cleaning agents. For manual cleaning, grease should be washed off both by hand and, if desired, in a dishwasher with settings that meet the specified temperature requirements.

**Charcoal Maintenance**

The charcoal function should be maintained by following the manufacturer's guides, with replacement done every few months. Cleaning requires pressing the charcoal filter upward and downward for removal. This maintenance is crucial for sustaining performance.
