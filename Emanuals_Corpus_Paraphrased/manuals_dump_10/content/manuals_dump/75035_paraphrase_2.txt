### EX-72D UK ENGLISH: PREPARATION GUIDELINES

**Before You Begin…**
Using the microwave effectively involves following a few key tips for better results.

**Cooking Time Settings**
- Always adhere to the recommended cooking times for defrosting, reheating, or cooking. Cooking food longer than suggested may lead to improper results.
- Ensure that food starts at the recommended temperature to ensure even cooking.

**Heating Temperatures**
- For defrosting or reheating, it’s assumed that food is generally at room temperature (around 20°C). 
- Follow instructions for specific temperature settings and avoid overcooking, especially items in shells, which may explode if not prepared correctly.

**Cooking Times**
- Cooking times also vary based on the amount of food. It’s essential to ensure even heating and consider adding salt, spices, and herbs to enhance flavor.

**Microwave Functionality**
- Microwaves can be used for various cooking methods. Understanding how different functions work together can yield better cooking results. 

**Using a Food Thermometer**
- A food thermometer is essential to check the internal temperature of the food to confirm it's adequately heated. For meats, juices should run clear, and fish should flake easily.

**Adding Water**
- Foods that retain moisture, like tomatoes, should be handled carefully to prevent bursting. Add water if necessary for steam.

**Blanching Vegetables**
- Blanching is recommended for preserving color and texture during cooking. Always cover with a suitable lid afterward to steam properly.

**Preserving Fruit and Vegetables**
- You can use the microwave for quick preservation. Follow specific instructions tailored to your microwave model.

**Portion Size**
- Adjust cooking times based on the quantity of food: 
  - Double the amount typically means nearly double the cooking time.
  - Half the amount generally requires half the cooking time.

**Container Selection**
- Choose deep, shallow, round, or oval containers appropriately, keeping in mind they should be microwave-safe to avoid overcooking.

**Covering Food**
- Cover food while microwaving to retain moisture. Some dishes, like certain roasts, benefit from being covered.

**Food Arrangement**
- Ensure food pieces are placed evenly in the microwave to allow microwaves to reach all areas effectively.

**Turning and Stirring**
- Turn food items that need an even cook, such as roasts or larger portions, to ensure consistent heating.

**Standing Time Importance**
- Food requires standing time post-cooking for even heat distribution throughout.

**Ready-Prepared Meals**
- When heating, always cover the meal to ensure it doesn't dry out, especially for items like coffee or microwavable meals.

**Thawing Guidelines**
- Thawing may take less time than cooking. Use a cover or lid to prevent splattering during this process.

**Cooking Fresh Vegetables**
- Cook fresh vegetables quickly while retaining their nutrients, using similar seasoning methods as usual.

**Cooking Meat, Fish, and Poultry**
- Ensure meat is thoroughly cooked. Variations in cooking times apply to different sizes and types.

**General Microwave Instructions**
- Follow section guidelines for cooking various foods. For example, when cooking soup or steaming vegetables, specifics may vary.

**Microwave Timer Use**
- Set the timer wisely to confirm the proper power levels and durations during the cooking process, ensuring it suits the food type.

**GRILL Cooking Only**
- To grill or brown food, set the appropriate grill options while monitoring for any burning.

Keep these tips in mind for effective and safe microwave cooking, ensuring the best results with every meal.

When adapting recipes for the microwave, consider adjusting the cooking time to one-third to half of the original duration. For foods that cook quickly, such as meats and poultry, microwaving is straightforward. For denser dishes, reduce the cooking time by approximately two-thirds. If needed, the cooking times for both low-fat and regular foods can be significantly shortened.
