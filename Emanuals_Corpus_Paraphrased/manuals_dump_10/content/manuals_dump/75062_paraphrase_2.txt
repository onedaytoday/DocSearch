**Microwave Functions**

The microwave has a PLUS and MINUS function for adjusting cooking times. If your food is undercooked, press PLUS; if it’s too firm, use MINUS. To access AUTO COOK, simply turn the TIMER/WEIGHT dial and press START/QUICK.

**Defrosting and Cooking Features**

For defrosting meats, fish, or poultry, select AUTO DEFROST and adjust the TIMER/WEIGHT as needed. During cooking, the microwave will emit sounds to indicate progress, and the display will flash.

**Cooking Tips**

Refer to the cooking charts for specific guidance on food types and quantities. For best results, rearrange and cover food as needed during the defrosting process. Keep in mind that minced meat should be turned during defrosting, and whole poultry should be carefully monitored.

When preparing gratins, grease the dish properly and layer ingredients thoughtfully. Season as needed, using ingredients like onions, garlic, and herbs to enhance flavor.

**General Recommendations**

For optimal heating without difficulty, reduce cooking times by one-third to one-half. Use a microwave-safe cover to contain moisture and flavors. Adjust quantities for low-fat foods and follow recommended guidelines to ensure proper cooking.

By using these guidelines, you can maximize the effectiveness of your microwave and achieve delicious results.

**Preparation Instructions:**

Finely chop the onion and garlic, then puree them. Add seasoning and cook with the minced meat and selected spices. Grease a baking dish and layer it with the minced meat mixture. Cover and cook, flipping once. Allow it to cool before slicing lengthwise and separating the flesh. Blend this with the onion until smooth. Season and top with remaining ingredients, cooking until done.

Chop the pears and cook them gently. As they cook, monitor and adjust the heat. After cooking, puree some of the pears, incorporating white ingredients as needed. Heat the remaining mixture while ensuring the contents are well mixed. Stir occasionally during cooking.
