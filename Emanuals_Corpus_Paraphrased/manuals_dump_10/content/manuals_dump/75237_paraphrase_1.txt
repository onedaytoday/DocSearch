**Preheating and Food Shelf Functions:**  
For optimal results, preheat the Rotitherm oven before placing prepared food items like chips or roasts on the designated shelves. Follow the roasting guidelines to avoid charring or burning meat. Adjustments may be necessary depending on the thickness of the meat or the chosen Rotitherm function (C). Ensure the food is not directly touching others on the shelf to facilitate even heat distribution.

**Defrosting Function:**  
When using the defrost function, unwrap the food and place it on the appropriate shelf. This process significantly speeds up thawing, especially for items like meats or produce. For effective defrosting, monitor progress and rotate items as necessary.

**Cleaning and Safety Warnings:**  
Before cleaning, ensure the oven is powered off and cool to prevent accidents. Use non-abrasive materials for cleaning, as harsh cleaners and scrapers can damage surfaces. The front glass and control panel should be handled gently to avoid scratching. Ensure any light fixtures are switched off before cleaning, and follow proper procedures to replace or clean the light bulb.

If issues arise, check for proper closure of the oven door or look for clock error indications. Repairs should be conducted by authorized personnel to maintain warranty coverage.
