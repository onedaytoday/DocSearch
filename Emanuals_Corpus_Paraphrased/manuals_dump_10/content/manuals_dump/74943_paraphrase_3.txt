### Operating Guidelines for the Seat and Transmission

#### Starting the Motor:
To initiate the seat operation, ensure the motor is warmed up, particularly in cold conditions (below 40°F/4°C). 

1. **Step-by-Step Procedure:**
   - Turn the key to the "START" position. Note: Only turn the key for a few seconds at a time. If the motor does not start after several attempts, wait a few seconds before trying again.
   - Ensure the transmission is engaged and operating smoothly.

2. **Warm-Up Requirement:**
   - After starting the engine, allow the transmission to warm up for one minute by placing the motion control lever in the neutral (N) position and releasing the clutch/brake pedal.

#### Transmission Purging:
For optimal performance, purging the transmission is essential, especially after repairs or replacements.
- If the transmission is removed for service, it must be purged before the tractor is used again.
- To purge, enter freewheel mode, engage the throttle, and allow the tractor to run in neutral for approximately three seconds. Repeat this process as needed.

#### Cutting Operation:
- Ensure the cutting area is clear of obstacles that could be ejected during operation.
- Adjust the cutting height according to the terrain conditions. If the grass is too thick, consider increasing the cutting height to maintain efficiency and reduce clumping.

#### Safety Warnings:
- Be mindful of the terrain conditions. Ensure no objects are at risk of being thrown while operating.
- When switching off, disconnect the power and allow the machine to come to a complete stop.
- Always engage the clutch/brake pedal when servicing the equipment. 

#### Routine Maintenance:
- Regularly inspect the tractor, including the battery and cooling system, to ensure all components are functioning properly and are free of leaks or debris.
- Maintain a service record, detailing all operations completed at specific intervals.

#### Blade Removal:
- To remove the blades, ensure safety and follow the proper disassembly procedure, taking care to avoid sharp edges. 

#### Assembly Instructions:
- When reassembling components, ensure all parts are securely tightened and properly aligned.

By adhering to these guidelines, the tractor's performance and lifespan can be significantly enhanced.

### Side-to-Side Adjustment of NL

To adjust the height from the ground, ensure that the adjustment is at its maximum on both sides. The components should be either aligned or within proximity of each other. If necessary, make adjustments accordingly. **Note:** Tolerance for height adjustment is approximately **SEITLICHE EINSTELLUNG A HINWEIS**: **REGLAGE TRANSVERSAL**; **REMARQUE**: **A ADJUSTE DE LADO A LADO**; **NOTA**: **REGOLAZIONE FIANCO FIANCO**; **NOTA**: **LINKS/RECHTS BIJSTELLEN**.

### Dismantling

Dismantle as previously instructed. Engage the clutch and rotate it clockwise until disengaged from the tractor. This procedure is only for replacement tasks.

### Transaxle Cooling

Inspect the transaxle cooling system regularly to ensure effectiveness. Clean as needed, especially during inspections or servicing. The transaxle pump fluid is factory-sealed and should remain intact. If servicing is required, engage an authorized service professional. **Translations for Cooling**: **REFROIDISSEMENT DE LA TRANSMISSION**; **ENFRIAMIENTO DEL TRANSEJE**; **RAFFREDDAMENTO ASSE-TRAZIONE**.

### Motion Control Lever Adjustment

The motion control lever should be adjusted as per factory specifications. Ensure proper spacing in the front-right area and move the lever slightly forward or backward. While holding the lever, ensure it is tightly secured. **Note:** If clearance adjustments lead to unwanted creeping or inconsistency, repeat the adjustment process until the motion is stable and secure.

### Troubleshooting

If issues arise such as high battery charge, improperly adjusted clutch/brake or gear settings, short circuits, or unbalanced parts, investigate potential factors affecting performance. Ensure all connections are intact and functioning optimally.

### Safety Notices

When cleaning components, utilize caution and allow surfaces to cool to avoid injury. Properly maintain documentation regarding service and warranty information. **Warning:** Exercise care to prevent any damage to sensitive parts during maintenance.

### Conclusion

Adhere to these instructions to maintain optimal performance and safety. Ensure all adjustments and checks align with the manufacturer's recommendations for effective operation.
