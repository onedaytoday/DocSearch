### USING THE SIMMER PLATE

To utilize the simmer plate, position it on the cooking surface, aligning it with the notches on top. Exercise caution and use potholders, as the plate can retain high heat and potentially cause burns. Ensure the plate cools adequately before placing it on heat-sensitive surfaces like countertops.

### SETTING SURFACE CONTROLS

Select the appropriate cooking settings based on the type and amount of food being prepared. Use the surface controls to adjust the settings and monitor the indicator lights. Always handle hot items with care to prevent fires or burns. The LITE indicator will activate once the control is in use. For manual ignition, refer to the instructions: strike a match and carefully ignite the burner.

### GETTING STARTED

After a power interruption, the lights may flash. To reset them, switch from BAKING back to OFF. For baking, preheat the oven to 350°F. The light will flash until the set temperature is reached, signaling readiness with a sound alert. 

### OVEN CONTROLS AND RACK ARRANGEMENT

Before setting the oven controls, ensure that the oven racks are arranged while the oven is cool. This is vital to prevent burns and promote even cooking. Recommended rack positions vary based on the type of food being prepared, ensuring optimal heat circulation.

### CONTROL FEATURES

Review the oven's functions according to their specified controls. The SELECTOR CONTROL KNOB facilitates selection among Convection, Clean, Broil, and Bake functions. Understanding these functions will enhance your cooking experience.

### BAKING ISSUES

For optimal results in baking cookies, breads, and cakes, ensure proper preheating and avoid overcrowding, which can lead to uneven cooking. Adjustments might be required if you experience inconsistent results or burning.

### CONVECTION COOKING

Convection cooking is suitable for a broad temperature range (170°F to 550°F). It allows heat to circulate effectively, promoting quicker and even cooking. Follow specific guidelines based on the food type, ensuring it is adequately spaced for heat distribution.

### BROILING

For broiling, preheat to ensure effective cooking and browning. Season food accordingly and monitor for grease accumulation. Always use caution to avoid flare-ups and consult cooking guides for specific instructions based on the food type.

### SELF-CLEANING ASSISTANCE

When using the self-clean feature, allow the oven to cool beforehand. Wear protective gear during manual cleaning and avoid using harsh chemicals that could interfere with the self-cleaning process. Ensure that any food residues are cleared prior to initiating the self-clean cycle.

For comprehensive cleaning, follow the outlined recommendations to maximize the appliance's efficiency while maintaining safety.

### Oven Self-Cleaning Instructions

#### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle
To initiate the self-clean cycle, allow the oven to cool down for about an hour. The self-cleaning process typically lasts several hours. 

**Warning:** During the self-cleaning cycle, the oven will become extremely hot. Ensure that children stay away from the oven. Do not attempt to force the door open while it is locked, as this can be dangerous.

**Caution:** The self-cleaning cycle locks the door for safety. Wait for the oven to cool down before attempting to unlock or open it.

#### General Cleaning
Before cleaning, ensure the oven is turned off and cooled down. Remove any spills or heavy soiling as soon as possible to reduce the need for major cleanings later. Regular cleaning helps maintain the oven's condition.

Use a soft cloth or sponge with appropriate cleaners. Avoid abrasive materials that can scratch surfaces. For stubborn grime, apply cleaner to the affected areas and clean with a soft cloth.

#### Cleaning Burner Components
When cleaning burner grates, caps, and heads, ensure these parts are cool. Use appropriate cleaning agents and avoid submerging gas components or allowing any liquids to enter gas orifice openings.

**Caution:** The stovetop is not removable. If service is needed, contact a professional technician.

#### Cooktop Cleaning
For ceramic glass cooktops, always ensure they are turned off and allowed to cool before cleaning. Use only suitable cleaning agents to avoid damage. Do not use heavy scrubbing materials, as they can scratch the surface.

For food spills, clean them immediately. If any material is allowed to sit on the cooktop, it may cause permanent discoloration.

#### Oven Door Removal and Replacement
To remove the oven door, locate the hinges on the front and apply the appropriate technique while rotating the top of the door. Follow specific care instructions to avoid damage.

#### Oven Light Maintenance
The oven light operates when the door is closed and can be turned on using a switch. Make sure that the protective glass shield is in place whenever the oven is in use.

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues
If burners do not light, ensure they are turned fully to "Lite" and that the gas supply is unobstructed. Clean any clogs as necessary.

For uneven burner flames, ensure the burner is correctly secured and clean. If you notice discoloration or scratches on the ceramic glass top, follow the recommended cleaning methods to maintain its appearance.

If the entire oven fails to operate, check the power supply and ensure all connections are secure. Also, check for tripped circuit breakers.

For excessive smoke during broiling, consider repositioning the meat for better clearance and ensure grease is regularly cleaned to prevent buildup.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can maintain the performance and appearance of your oven and cooktop.

**Common Issues with Self-Cleaning Cycle**  
The self-cleaning cycle may not function properly if the oven door is closed incorrectly. Please ensure to follow the provided instructions. If the self-cleaning process is interrupted, the indicator light will turn off after a few seconds. Additionally, if soil remains after the completion of the self-cleaning cycle, consider cleansing the oven manually or check for high grease levels that could cause flames or smoke from the vent.
