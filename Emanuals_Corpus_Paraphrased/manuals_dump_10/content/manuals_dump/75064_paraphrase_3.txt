### Microwave Operation Guide

The microwave manages defrosting and cooking automatically based on the food type selected. It is important to unpack food from its packaging and adhere to recommended defrosting instructions. Turn the food or cover it with heat-resistant materials when necessary.

For cooking fresh poultry and meats, follow these guidelines:

- **Defrosting**: Use the microwave settings to ensure proper defrosting without cooking the food. Always turn the food at least once during defrosting.
  
- **Cooking Instructions**: When cooking a dish, select the appropriate setting using the rotary dial and press the START/QUICK button. The timer will sound upon completion.

**Defrosting Time Guidelines**:
- Whole poultry: Turn once during the process.
- Chopped meat: Ensure even defrosting by turning halfway through.
- Shrimp or crab: Defrost thoroughly while turning once.

For baked goods, such as cakes, cover them with a towel while defrosting to retain moisture. 

### Heating Guidelines
Ensure food is heated without being overloaded. Cover dishes with appropriate lids or plates to ensure proper heating. 

**General Advice**:
- Always check that the microwave is correctly closed and connected before starting it.
- Clean the appliance regularly using non-abrasive cloths. Avoid scouring pads to maintain the integrity of the surfaces.
