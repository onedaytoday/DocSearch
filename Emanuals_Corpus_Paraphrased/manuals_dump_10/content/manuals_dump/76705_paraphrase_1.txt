### Frame-Folding Projection Setup Instructions

1. **Unfolding the Frame**: Begin by expanding the frame. Ensure that it extends evenly. Once fully visible, press the designated button to unlock the mechanism.

3. **T-Leg Configuration**: Align the T-legs as depicted in the instructions and secure them in place.
