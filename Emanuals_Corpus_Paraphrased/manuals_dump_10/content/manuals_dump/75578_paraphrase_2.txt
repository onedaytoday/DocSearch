The system comprises coolers operating between -2°C and +8°C, designed with varying thicknesses and equipped with built-in features. These three coolers utilize pre-charged cooling systems and are constructed using advanced injection techniques. They are designed for high performance and feature pre-painted polyurethane insulation, free from CFC and HCFC. The interiors have rounded corners, and the fast-fit system facilitates installation, ensuring airtight connections using high-quality PVC. The models are compatible with R404A and can handle ambient temperatures up to +43°C.

Defrosting is optimized through heated elements to minimize cycle times, and the internal lighting is rated IP54. Included features comprise an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting control, and a thermostat. The right-hinged door is designed to be smoothly rounded, ensuring airtight closure and efficient insulation, which helps maintain optimal temperature conditions while also adhering to HACCP guidelines.
