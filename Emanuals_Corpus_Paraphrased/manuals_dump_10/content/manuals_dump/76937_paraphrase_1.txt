**IMPORTANT: All services must be carried out by an authorized technician.**

**Installers, please take note:** Grounding electrical devices such as telephones and computers to water lines is a standard practice. This grounding may occur within the building or outside of it. However, this setup can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, resulting in electrolysis that may impart a metallic taste or elevate the metal concentration in the water. To prevent this issue, it's vital to utilize the appropriate materials as specified. Any drain fittings installed should be made of plastic to ensure electrical isolation between the fountain and the building's plumbing system.

**Installation Instructions:** Ensure the fountain is properly located and securely mounted. Do not solder tubes inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. Connect the supply and adjust accordingly.

Refer to the manual for specific installation details concerning the EDF210C (two-station fountain) and EDF310C (three-station fountain). 

**Important:** Follow the rough-in dimensions provided for both the EDF210C and EDF310C models carefully.

**Itemized Parts List:** Please see the detailed parts list enumerating various components, including the cover assembly, housing assembly, trap assembly, and bracket assembly for both models. Note the water inlet and direction of flow as indicated in the figures provided.

**Caution:** Do not modify the orifice material by filing or cutting. 

For further guidance on troubleshooting and maintenance, refer to the detailed instructions in the manual. 

**NOTE:** All materials used should comply with lead-free standards for the water cooler application.
