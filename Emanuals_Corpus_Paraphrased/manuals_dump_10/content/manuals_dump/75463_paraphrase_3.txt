S90 Induction Island (WIWRAAQOOB) and S90 Induction Base (WIXRAAQOOB) feature a three-phase operating system. These units are designed for cooking with induction technology, incorporating a heavy-duty top that connects multiple cooking surfaces. They offer a two-year service warranty and a one-year warranty for professional use. For more information, visit www.electroluxusa.com/professional or contact SW Telephone.

Each induction cooking zone provides instant heat, with controls located conveniently to indicate operation status. The smooth plate is heated directly, preventing any burning when connected. The unit can come with an optional round plinth and portioning shelf, and is equipped to operate at 27.8A (WIWRAAQOOB) and 24.1A for the induction top. 

It's essential to ensure proper heat insulation is installed if the unit's depth is altered. The S90 Induction Island maintains the right to modify product specifications without prior notice.
