Welcome to Electrolux. Thank you for choosing our products designed for your comfort. This manual provides essential information to ensure ease of use.

### GENERAL INFORMATION

This appliance can operate in either ducted mode (venting outside) or recirculation mode (filtering and recycling air). When installing during winter, the recycling setup should capture heat from the cooking area. Itâ€™s crucial to adhere to guidelines regarding the expulsion of contaminated air to prevent potential damage or injury resulting from improper installation.

### SAFETY WARNINGS

1. When utilizing the extraction mode, do not connect the cooker hood duct to systems that utilize non-electric heat sources (e.g., gas heaters). Ensure the electrical supply is appropriate for the appliance rating and that it is properly earthed.
   
2. The cooker hood must be installed at a safe distance from the cooking surface to avoid overheating or fire hazards.
   
3. If the room contains fuel-burning appliances (such as heating boilers), these must be of a sealed or balanced nature. Ensure the air supply is adequate to maintain safe operation.
   
4. The cooker hood's design prevents backdraft, ensuring a reliable operation without hindrance.

5. If the power supply cord is damaged, replace it immediately with an authorized service provider.
