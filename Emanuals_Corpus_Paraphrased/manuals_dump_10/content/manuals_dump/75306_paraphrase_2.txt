Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

To operate the appliance, ensure it is closed properly. When removing items, adjust the thermostat functions as necessary to accommodate different food thicknesses. Utilize preheating or adjust heat settings according to the cooking requirements and monitor the thermostat indicator light. Follow the cooking chart based on the type of dish (e.g., chicken breast) to ensure accurate cooking times and food quantities, allowing enough space to cook thoroughly. Foods should be toasted lightly and monitored throughout the process, turning them as needed to prevent burning or uneven cooking. 

The thermal cooking function enables even heat distribution around the food, resulting in a consistent cooking process, which is efficient for items that usually require longer cooking times. Select the cooking function and set the thermostat to 200°C, adhering to the thermal cooking guidelines.

For defrosting, this function operates without heat, streamlining the defrosting process. It is ideal for thawing frozen foods such as iced cakes or yeast products. Always cook items thoroughly immediately after defrosting. During this function, ensure the food is rotated as necessary for even thawing.

For cleaning, shut off the electricity supply and allow the appliance to cool down. Use non-abrasive cleaners to avoid damaging the surface finish. Avoid bleach and recommend specific household cleaners for non-stick surfaces. Clean the cavity regularly, and use a soft cloth for the shelves and interior.

Regarding light replacement, adhere to the specified wattage and type (E14). If light issues arise, ensure proper wiring and connections. Refer to the troubleshooting section for solutions to common problems, including concerns with cooking functions or speed.

In case of malfunction, contact Service Force for assistance. Any appliance service must adhere to specified guidelines for coverage under warranty. This includes ensuring proper usage as per the instruction manual and addressing any necessary repairs with authorized personnel.
