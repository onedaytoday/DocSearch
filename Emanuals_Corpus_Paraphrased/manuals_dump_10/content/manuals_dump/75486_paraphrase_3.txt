**Function Overview: Heat Selection and Switching**

The phase of the selected heat function is indicated on the heat selection display. The indicator lights for several seconds when the function is activated. If a different heat setting is chosen while the function is active, the selected higher heat will be shown. Should the heat function be switched off, it will do so immediately. 

In the event that the function is deactivated, the heat selection indicator will cease to illuminate. The system has a child safety mechanism that protects against unintended activation. Once the cooking process is paused and the child lock is engaged, an acoustic signal will sound after a brief period. Touching the heat selection field will display relevant information, and if the lock is engaged, it can be released after some time. 

To ensure safety during cooking, functions like the switch-off feature will deactivate if any irregular activity is detected, illustrated by an audio alert. Once the cooking has completed its cycle, selecting the appropriate cooking function will cause the relevant indicator lights to flash.

**Operation Guidelines: Heat Settings and Duration**

The heat settings and cooking durations are crucial for successful food preparation based on the type of food being cooked. The duration for cooking phases is adjustable. For instance, options include warming, frying, and steaming, each with specific time settings. 

**Cleaning Procedures**

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining appliance functionality. Use appropriate cleaning solutions and tools to remove food residues from heated surfaces. If any stubborn debris remains or if plastic burns occur, these should be addressed immediately, ensuring that the appliance cools down sufficiently before cleaning. For persistent issues or malfunction warnings, refer to the provided troubleshooting guidelines. 

**Malfunction and Safety Mechanisms**

If the appliance detects excessive heat, an overheat protection mechanism will initiate, thereby halting the cooking process. In case of an electric trip or a malfunction, disconnect the appliance from the power supply and allow it to cool before performing any maintenance. Service inquiries should be directed to qualified personnel from Service Force.

**Installation and Technical Regulations**

Finally, it is imperative that the appliance is installed and wired by trained professionals adhering to all operational regulations to prevent any hazards, ensuring compliance with fire protection standards as specified in EN guidelines.
