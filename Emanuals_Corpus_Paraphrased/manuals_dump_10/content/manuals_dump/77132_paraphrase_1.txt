The LCD touchmonitor operates by refreshing graphic data for the display and clock through either VGA or a secure connection with the LCD. The refresh rates are optimized to match the LCD's specifications, particularly for its XGA-15 inch format. Variants of the input are available, including VGA, SVGA, and XGA, with the native resolution having implications for vertical alignment. 

When using VGA and its corresponding inputs, it is essential to ensure compatibility with the LCD’s settings to avoid display artifacts, such as character distortions. Information about the touchmonitor is detailed across Chapter Installation and Chapter Operation. To minimize shock hazards, users should turn off the device while cleaning and ensure it is connected to a properly grounded outlet using a 3-wire cord. Unauthorized tampering may void the warranty.
