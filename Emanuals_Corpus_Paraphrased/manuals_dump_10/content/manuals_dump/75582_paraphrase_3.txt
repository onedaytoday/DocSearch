The cooling system features units designed to operate within a temperature range of -2/+8°C, incorporating various thickness options and either built-in or standalone configurations. These coolers are equipped with pre-charged refrigerant and constructed from materials that enhance thermal performance, using high-quality, pre-painted polyurethane insulation. The units are free from CFCs and HCFCs, and they feature rounded internal corners that enhance usability.

The fast-fit design ensures airtight sealing with high-performance PVC components. These units accommodate ambient temperatures up to +43°C and utilize refrigerants such as R404A, providing reliable operation in both high and low conditions. The defrosting system employs heated elements to minimize frost build-up, complemented by internal IP54-rated lighting.

Key features include an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting control, a functioning thermostat, and a right-hinged door that operates smoothly with rounded cam-lift action hinges. These attributes ensure high insulation and reduce operational costs while complying with HACCP standards.
