**Cautionary Notes for PLL AM/FM (U.S. Owner's Manual CKS1800)**

**WARNING**: To avoid fire or electrical shock hazards, do not use this plug with an extension cord, socket, or other outlet unless the blades can be fully inserted to prevent exposure. Additionally, keep this appliance away from rain and moisture to mitigate fire or shock risks. 

**CAUTION**: To minimize electric shock, do not remove the cover (or back); there are no user-serviceable components inside. Please direct any servicing to qualified personnel.

This appliance is of Class II design, featuring insulation and protective earth support. 

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**: Adhere to the guidelines laid out in these instructions. Use a cloth for cleaning, and avoid exposure to heat sources such as heaters or devices that emit heat. 

Power cords should not be damaged or pinched, particularly at connectors or entries; follow proper routing during installation or servicing. In the event of moisture exposure, immediately disconnect it from the outlet.

**Battery Safety**: Do not expose batteries to heat sources or replace them inaccurately. 

**Thank You for Choosing This Emerson Clock**: This clock operates on AC power and automatically adjusts to Daylight Saving Time changes. 

**FCC Compliance**: This device has been tested and meets Class B compliance. It provides reasonable protection against interference when properly installed and operated. If interference occurs, try adjusting the position of the unit or consulting the instructions. 

**Preparation for Use**: Ensure the device is placed away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Use the supplied power cord for AC connection. 

To set the time zone and operational details, refer to the guidance provided under “Operating Instructions.” 

To adjust the clock’s settings, hold the appropriate buttons until the desired input is achieved. 

For alarm settings, press the ALARM button to select desired configurations, ensuring AM/PM indicators are correctly displayed. 

The clock allows adjustment of time and alarm settings independently. Follow instructions for precise adjustments.

The display indicates the selected options. It shows the selected alarm and alarm mode for the current day of the week. To modify settings, disengage the alarm mode and follow the necessary steps. Check the alarm by using the corresponding buttons. The display will show the currently selected day of the week. To turn on the radio, press the RADIO ON/OFF button. Adjust the tuning to AM or FM, ensuring the volume is appropriately set—neither too loud nor too quiet. Use the TUNING button to select stations, pressing and releasing as needed. The volume can be adjusted once the radio is on, and the selected band is indicated. 

To recall station settings, press the MEMORY button, which shows memory locations as "P XX" for currently stored stations. The display will indicate the memory location after the appropriate button is pressed for a few seconds. To store a station, follow the same procedure. If AM reception is poor, try adjusting the internal antenna; for FM, connect to AC power. 

Note: The alarm can be set to produce a buzzer sound when triggered, which will stop automatically after the designated hour. To turn off either the radio or buzzer alarm, use the ALARM buttons as indicated. The SNOOZE/SLEEP feature allows for additional sleep time, which can be adjusted by pressing the SLEEP button. 

To change the DIMMER setting, use the corresponding function, particularly if the clock brightness is too high. The built-in lithium battery may need replacing after a few years or if the LOW BATT indicator flashes. Replace it with a 3V lithium CR2032 type. 

**Warning:** There is a risk of explosion if the battery is incorrectly replaced; only use the same or equivalent type. 

If the clock loses power due to a depleted battery, the time and day settings will need to be reset. Follow instructions to set the clock and date by pressing the MONTH/DATE and TIME buttons together. 

For care and maintenance, use a soft, dry cloth for dust, and ensure cleanliness without harsh chemicals.
