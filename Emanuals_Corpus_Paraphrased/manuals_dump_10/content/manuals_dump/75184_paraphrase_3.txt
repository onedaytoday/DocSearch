1. Ensure proper installation and grounding according to ANSI/NFPA and CSA standards.
2. Allow sufficient cooling time before servicing or handling any components.
3. Keep flammable materials away from the oven, including paper and textiles.
4. Never leave children unattended in proximity to the oven.
5. Avoid touching the oven's interior surfaces during and shortly after use due to high temperatures.

#### Fire Safety  
In the event of a grease fire, smother the flames with a lid or use a foam-type fire extinguisher. Regularly clean the oven to prevent grease buildup.

#### Self-Cleaning Ovens  
When using the self-clean feature, make sure to remove any protective coatings or cleaners that may interfere with the function.

### Preheating Instructions

**Preheating Overview**  
Preheating is essential when roasting or baking food. The oven should be preheated to a temperature range of 170°F to 550°F (77°C to 288°C). For instance, to preheat to 350°F, make sure the oven racks are correctly positioned. Use the appropriate controls to select “UPPER” and “BAKE.” You will notice the display will flash and indicate "PRE" while the temperature is rising. When the preheating is complete (e.g., reaching 350°F), an audible alert will sound, signaling that it’s time to place food in the oven. 

If you need to preheat to a temperature of 425°F, follow the same procedure. The display will flash "UPPER" and "BAKE" until that temperature is achieved, at which point a sound will indicate readiness. 

### Baking Instructions

When baking cookies, bread, or cakes, allow for proper preheating as advised in the instructions. You may need to adjust temperatures by about 25°F (approximately 12°C) for medium-weight dishes. Monitoring the distribution of food within the oven is critical to prevent overcrowding; avoid placing items that may warp due to high heat in the same batch.

### Convection Cooking

**Convection Baking Overview**  
Convection cooking circulates hot air around the food, allowing for even cooking at typically lower temperatures. Adjust cooking times based on food type, reducing the suggested time if necessary. 

For convection roasting and baking, set the oven to the desired temperature, and select "CONVECTION" along with the appropriate cooking function. The display will indicate readiness as the temperature rises, providing an audible alert upon reaching the target temperature.

### General Tips

- Ensure that food is not placed in a warp-prone manner, and allow enough clearance around each item for optimal heat flow.
- Monitor the temperature and cooking times per your specific guidelines to ensure proper doneness.
- Avoid frequent opening of the oven door to maintain a consistent cooking environment.

### Setting the Convection Convert Feature

To effectively use the Convection Convert function, ensure it is activated with appropriate food types at the correct temperature (350°F or 325°F). Monitor your cooking; a notification sound will indicate when the food is nearly finished and when it has completed cooking. 

### Delayed Bake and Timed Bake Functions

Use the Delayed Bake feature for meat and similar foods, adhering to food safety guidelines by avoiding extended delays. For best results, set the clock to appropriate times, ensuring it does not exceed the recommended hours. When using the Timed Bake function, input your desired cooking duration, and the oven will turn off automatically after completion.

### Broiling Instructions

For broiling, preheat the oven until it reaches high temperatures, around 400°F to 550°F. This is crucial for achieving optimal searing. Always monitor the cooking process to prevent grease fires, and never cover food with materials that might catch fire.

### Sabbath Feature

This feature is designed specifically for Jewish Sabbath observances. Ensure to consult relevant instructions to utilize this feature appropriately.

### Self-Cleaning Instructions

Before using the self-cleaning function, allow the oven to cool and take necessary safety precautions. It is vital to avoid using harsh cleaners or coatings. The self-cleaning cycle will eliminate residues effectively. Pay attention to safety indicators, and never force doors or locks during operation, as the system can become extremely hot.

### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle

For the self-clean cycle, ensure the oven is empty of racks and conducive to cleaning. Set the appropriate time for the cleaning cycle, which typically lasts several hours. Wait until the cleaning is complete before attempting to open the oven door, as it remains locked until cooled.

### Cleaning Procedures

**Self-Cleaning Options:**
- Use the self-cleaning feature for the upper door and door lock functions. The oven will automatically go into self-clean mode when the "DOOR" and "LOCKED" indicators light up. Allow approximately 30 seconds for the cycle to initiate. 
- If you wish to clean immediately after self-cleaning, ensure the "UPPER" and "DELAY" indicators are off and reset the cycle if needed.

**General Cleaning Guidelines:**
- Turn off the oven and allow it to cool before cleaning. Promptly remove any spills or heavy soiling to minimize the need for major cleaning later.
- Regular maintenance will help reduce extensive cleaning requirements in the future. Use a damp cloth with mild soap for painted surfaces, decorative trims, and chrome racks. Avoid abrasive cleaners that can damage the finish.

**Special Cleaning Instructions:**
- For stainless steel surfaces, follow specific guidelines to maintain appearance. To remove the oven door, access the hinges at the front, applying pressure as instructed. 
- Remove the hidden bake element cover by pulling it from the back while unscrewing the front. Ensure the oven light switch is turned off before cleaning the light shield, and be cautious as the oven should be cool prior to handling.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the oven control beeps or displays an error code, press "CANCEL" to reset the system. Ensure the oven is plugged in and that there is power supply. 
- Should the oven light fail, check for burned-out bulbs or faulty connections.
- If facing excessive smoking during broiling, ensure the meat is not too close to the heating element, and avoid overcrowding in the oven.
