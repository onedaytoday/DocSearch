### Operating Instructions

#### General Information
This equipment, designed for cooking meat, operates on gas and offers options for smooth or combined cooking surfaces. The unit is configured with GN dimensions for efficient operation.

#### Igniting the Pilot Burner
To ignite the pilot burner, operate the individual switches by pressing them and turning clockwise for a few seconds. Continue pressing until the flame is ignited. If the pilot does not light within the allocated time, repeat the process.

#### Igniting the Main Burner
Turn the main burner control anti-clockwise from the off position to the desired thermal setting.

#### Temperature Selection
Settings range from low to high, with a maximum of 570°F (300°C). It's important to adjust the intensity based on cooking requirements.

#### Initial Operation
Before use, ensure the entire cooking surface is preheated for optimal performance, aiming for 320°F (160°C).

#### Preheating
The heating supply must be adequately adjusted for effective cooking.

#### Cooking Guidelines
- For cooking thinner items, use higher temperatures, while thicker items require lower temperatures.
- Ensure the surface is properly maintained for even heat distribution.

#### Collecting Liquids
Make sure to collect any liquids produced during cooking for easy cleanup.

#### Turning Off the Grill/Griddle Main Burner
To turn off the main burner, rotate the control clockwise back to the off position. This will stop any combustion and extinguish the pilot flame.

#### Long Shutdowns
In cases where the unit will not be in use for an extended period, ensure that the gas supply is turned off if the temperature drops significantly (below 32°F or 0°C). Clean the surface with a thin protective coating.

#### Cleaning Instructions
After allowing the unit to cool, perform routine cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning products as necessary, avoiding high-pressure methods to prevent damage. Keep the gas burner pathways clear to avoid clogs or backfire.

#### Malfunction Reporting
Should any operational issues arise, contact customer service for assistance. Regular checks of the thermostat and thermal elements are essential for effective operation.

#### Storage Recommendations
Ensure proper storage conditions in accordance with guidelines.
