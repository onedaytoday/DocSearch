Here's the paraphrased text in a natural, technical way:

Whether selected by users or their own choice, there are various options for washing. Traditional powders can be applied directly to clothing, while traditional liquids may require immediate application or measured doses, typically at the top and back of the washer.

Compact powders and liquids, also known as compact detergents, should be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions, either directly on clothes or as specified. Fabric conditioners should be utilized to soften fabrics, particularly for easy-care items, and users should follow operational guidelines specific to their machine type.

Warnings: 
- Do not exceed load limits, as this can impact the washing performance, especially for bulky items which can pose a fire risk.
- Certain materials, if improperly mixed, can lead to dangerous reactions.

When it comes to drying cycles, the appropriate settings depend on load type and drying preferences. For example, the selection process involves different lights indicating stages such as rinse hold or normal cycles. Users should ensure the rinse cycle is complete, and if excess creasing occurs, further adjustments may be needed.

Be cautious about overloading the washer and ensure detergent amounts are correct; regularly check the detergent dispenser to avoid blockage. If the rinse hold option is engaged, the associated indicator will light up.

For delayed washing functions, the timer setting will show countdown details once the START/PAUSE button is pressed. In case of errors indicated by specific codes, consult the troubleshooting section or seek assistance from service professionals.

During operation, proper use of spin speeds and drying times is critical to avoid damage to clothing or the appliance. Regular maintenance such as cleaning hose connections and filter checks should be conducted to maintain optimal performance.

For specific washing programs, consult the provided charts that detail appropriate cycle settings for different fabric types, ensuring that products are used in accordance with testing guidelines to achieve the best results.

For cleaning and maintenance, disconnect the appliance when necessary and follow best practices for emptying and servicing components. Always ensure that hoses are properly attached and check for any potential issues related to drainage or connection.

If issues arise, such as error codes indicating supply or connection problems, immediate action should be taken to rectify these faults by checking hose fittings and ensuring everything is secure before restarting the cycle.
