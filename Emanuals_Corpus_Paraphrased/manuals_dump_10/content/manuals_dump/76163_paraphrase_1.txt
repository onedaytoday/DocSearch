## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Ensure all installation dimensions are adhered to, including canopies and chimney sizes. The appliance is designed for various electric and gas hob configurations. Follow applicable guidelines for recycling and disposal.

## ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

This appliance is double insulated and should not be earthed. It is crucial to comply with I.E.E. regulations. Ensure that connections are made according to the appliance's rating plate.

## INSTALLING THE COOKER HOOD

When installing, ensure that you follow the specified guidelines to prevent operational breakdowns and comply with local regulations. Unpack the unit carefully, following the illustrated instructions for proper assembly.

### Clearance Height Guidelines

For the installation of the cooker, refer to the specified clearance height outlined in the technical instructions. This dimension is essential whether the cooker is freestanding or built-in. Ensure you adhere to the indicated heights (A, B, C, D).

### Installing the Cooker Hood

The height of the cooker hood should align with the recommended clearance to optimize its performance. For high-efficiency cooking, proper setup is crucial, whether you're using ducting or a recirculation system. Install the hood with a charcoal filter as necessary.

### Wall Installation

Mount the hood securely onto the wall at the suggested height, ensuring that the reference measurements are followed closely. Utilize the supplied screws to fix the unit. If the wall material is hollow or complies with different specifications, ensure to use appropriate anchors for stability.

### Extraction and Ducting

For optimal extraction, the hood should be ducted as directly as possible. Any bends or unnecessary lengths can impair performance. Adherence to regional building standards, such as British or DIN 4102-B1, is necessary for ensuring safety and efficiency.

### Charcoal Filter

If a charcoal filter is required, it should be integrated properly to enhance air purification. The installation should provide a direct path for airflow to avoid any obstructions.

### Electrical Connections

Follow the electrical connection guidelines closely, ensuring the unit is connected safely and effectively.

### Chimney Installation

The chimney component should be positioned slightly to facilitate the connection with the outlet, using the provided screws for secure anchoring. Adjustments may be necessary to ensure a proper fit as indicated in the installation documentation.
