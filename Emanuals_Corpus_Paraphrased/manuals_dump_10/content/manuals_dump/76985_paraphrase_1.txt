You can also switch between Color and Black & White modes, adjust settings for static or moving content, and manage various factory settings through simple navigation. When activated, the interface shows a series of arrows that help guide your selection.

The NEAR/FAR setting can automatically adjust the focus, and the TELE/WIDE option allows users to set the iris. The white microphone indicator reflects when audio is active, and you can follow audio automatically. Color adjustments can be made using red, green, and blue buttons to achieve desired effects.

#### Network Functions

To connect via Ethernet (10BASE-T/100BASE-TX), ensure the PC and device are properly configured. Use FTP for image transfer and ensure a stable connection with authorized ELMO services. To set the device's IP address, follow the outlined connections and make sure it complies with specified configurations.

If you need to reset to factory settings, adjustments can be made by accessing the appropriate DIP switches. After any changes, always restart the power supply to apply settings. To access the network features and confirm or change configurations, refer to the corresponding pages in your manual.

User authentication will be required for network access. If incorrect information is submitted, you will be prompted to retry. Please ensure to carefully check the IP and settings to avoid connectivity issues.

Should you wish to utilize FTP functions, you'll need a stable connection. Follow specific URL guidelines to interact with the device through a web browser. Confirm the settings and complete the network configurations prior to any operations. If tasks are completed successfully, the appropriate LEDs will indicate the completion of processes.

Be sure to consult the specifications for FTP requirements, including username and password protocols, to ensure successful operation.
