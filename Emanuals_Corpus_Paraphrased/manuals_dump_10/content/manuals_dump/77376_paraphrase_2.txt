**Basic Operation of the Air Cleaner:**

Air enters the cleaner through section A, where pollutants are captured. It flows through the ionizing section B, where particles are charged. Subsequently, in section C, these charged particles are collected on plates. This process results in clean, filtered air returning to the supply.

---

**Air Cleaner Construction:**

The air cleaner is designed for ease of installation. Its modular components include a mounting setup compatible with existing frameworks that accommodates the collecting and ionizing sections. Each section connects to wires facilitating the high-voltage supply necessary for operation.

---

**Preinstallation Guidance:**

**Determining Filter Location:**
Choose a location that allows for proper airflow and clearance. If using a specific transition section, ensure it's positioned correct to maintain airflow direction as supplied from the factory.

**Airflow Direction:**
The unit is preconfigured for left-to-right airflow. Adjustments can be made for right-to-left if required. Always verify that connections align with airflow indicators.

---

**Typical Mounting Positions:**
- Basement Furnace (Lowboy)
- Counterflow Furnace Installation
- Highboy Furnace

---

**Installation Steps:**

**1. Remove and Discard Old Filter:**
   - Ensure the blower compartment is clean before installation.
   - Ensure the new air cleaner is positioned properly for airflow.

**2. Wiring Instructions:**
   - Follow local electrical codes. The unit must be wired to avoid electrical hazards.
   - Ensure all connections are secured and compliant.

**3. Grounding:**
   - Proper grounding is essential to prevent electric shock.
