The amplifiers enhance in-home sound quality, distinguishing between channel outputs such as surround and right surround.

For troubleshooting, if the LED indicator is on but you don't hear sound from the subwoofer, ensure it’s properly connected to the LINE IN and the ON/Stand-by switch is enabled. For further assistance, consult the troubleshooting guide or seek professional service advice.
