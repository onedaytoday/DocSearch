The Iron AIA Iron (DGR15U) comes with ribbed/smooth (DGS15U) and smooth/smooth (DGSS15U) configurations, designed for single-phase operation. It offers a convenient cooking surface, featuring both smooth and professional plates, which are resistant to scratches and oxidation due to their durable coating. The heating elements are shock-proof and integrated into the plate, ensuring excellent thermal conductivity. It also includes a built-in thermostat adjustable up to F. The cooking surface is made of AISI-treated materials, providing high resistance to oxidation, and is ETL and NEMA 5-20P listed.

When using the machine for the first time, itâ€™s essential to ensure that all grease is removed from the mechanical components to avoid overheating. Regular cleaning should occur at least once a week or after cooking sessions as needed. It is crucial to empty the grease container during these cleaning operations to maintain performance.
