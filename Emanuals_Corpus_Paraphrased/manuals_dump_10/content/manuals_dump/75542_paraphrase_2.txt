**IMPORTANT: READ AND RETAIN THESE INSTRUCTIONS**

#### Safety and Installation Guidelines
Congratulations on your purchase of the ES510L from Products, Inc. It is vital to adhere to the installation instructions provided, including proper grounding methods. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in fire, electric shock, or other serious risks, so service should only be performed by a qualified technician.

The operating manual includes specifications about features and usage, and safety graphics are included for reference. Please read this manual thoroughly to ensure safe operation.

#### Gas Safety Information
**If you detect a gas odor**:
1. Avoid using any electrical switches.
2. Evacuate the area and contact emergency services or your gas supplier immediately.

Ensure that your appliance is properly grounded to prevent the risk of electric shock. Installation must comply with national safety standards such as ANSI Z223.1 and NFPA regulations.

#### Safety Warnings for Children
Do not allow children to play with or access the range. Accessible areas may cause severe burns. Keep flammable items away from the cooktop, and instruct children not to touch hot surfaces.

#### Fire Precautions
In the case of grease or oil fires, smother with a lid or use a foam-type extinguisher. Always keep potholders dry to prevent burns.

#### Operational Guidelines
**For Electric Ignition Models**:
Ensure the function is disengaged when not in use. Proper use of controls ensures efficient cooking and minimizes risks. When lighting the cooktop manually, use caution and turn the knob to "LITE" while keeping matches away from the burner head.

Arrange oven racks when the oven is cool, as proper placement allows optimal heat circulation. Unobstructed ducts beneath the backguard are essential for effective ventilation.

#### Cleaning Instructions
Regularly clean your range to prevent grease accumulation, which can pose a fire risk. Only use approved cleaners for self-cleaning functions, and avoid using any abrasive materials that may damage the surface.

For self-cleaning ovens, remove any food residues and follow the recommended procedures. The self-cleaning cycle should only be used in accordance with provided instructions.

#### Note on California Residents
California law requires this notice concerning potential exposure to chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive harm.

For additional features, consult the product manual, and always arrange cookware to promote even cooking and avoid blocking vents.

If you have further questions about your appliance, please refer to the warranty terms or contact customer service for assistance.

### Warming Instructions for Food Items

To effectively warm food, place it in an upright position, allowing both the top and bottom surfaces of the items and cookware to be exposed to heat. It is advisable to cover food to maintain quality while warming. 

#### Warming Settings
The warming feature has multiple settings: HI (High), MED (Medium), and LO (Low). To preheat the warming function for food, you can set the dial accordingly. 

- **High Setting (HI)**: Recommended for poultry and chops.
- **Medium Setting (MED)**: Suitable for a variety of foods.
- **Low Setting (LO)**: Best for empty plates.

The warming indicator light will activate when in use and will turn off when the function is disabled. 

#### Removing Items
To turn off the warming function, simply adjust the dial to the OFF position. Ensure that items are removed safely to avoid burns or damage.

### Cleaning and Maintenance
Before using the oven, review the instructions thoroughly. Use the following options: 

- **Speed Clean**: A one-hour cleaning cycle.
- **Self-Clean**: Available with MAXX CLEAN for a thorough clean.

To set the timer, adjust the clock and familiarize yourself with the controls. 

### Timer and Clock Adjustments
The timer can be programmed for various durations. To reset the clock after a power interruption, follow the prompts on the display. 

- To toggle between hours and minutes, use the respective buttons as indicated.

### Baking Instructions
For baking, you can select temperatures ranging from 170°F to 550°F. To initiate baking:

1. Press the "BAKE" button.
2. Set your desired temperature.
3. The oven will notify you when it has reached the set temperature.

### Safety Precautions
Be cautious when operating the oven to avoid fire hazards. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water. Instead, use a suitable fire extinguisher and ensure that the oven is turned off. 

Use the oven and broiler features responsibly, following the manufacturer's guidelines to avoid accidents and maintain food quality.

### Cooking Instructions

When preparing food, the cooking process involves heating it to a designated temperature, often using a range of settings. For instance, with the appliance set to "BAKE" at 350°F, you initiate the heating by pressing the appropriate button. This activates the heat source, ensuring that the food is cooked evenly. 

To adjust the cooking temperature, buttons will flash to indicate the desired settings, and audible signals will confirm the process. For best results, food should be placed adequately within the appliance, using racks if necessary, to ensure consistent heat distribution.

When utilizing the Sabbath mode, certain functions may be limited, and the appliance is designed to maintain a specified temperature for a fixed duration without manual interference. It's critical to follow provided guidelines to avoid incorrect operations that may disrupt the cooking process. 

### Self-Cleaning Instructions

The self-cleaning feature employs high temperatures to eliminate residues, and this function should be utilized with caution. Before activating, ensure that children are not nearby, as the oven interior will become very hot. Do not attempt to force any components or clean the racks during the self-cleaning cycle. 

After this cycle, the oven will need to cool down, and indicators will display when it’s safe to re-open. In the event of any malfunctions or concerns about temperatures, refer to the operational manual for guidance on troubleshooting.

### General Cleaning Guidelines

For routine cleaning, lightweight cloths and approved cleaners are recommended to maintain the appliance's surfaces. Avoid using harsh agents that could damage the finish. In areas requiring sensitive treatment—such as painted grates—stick to gentle cleaning methods. 

If stubborn residues persist, follow specific recommendations for using scouring pads or similar tools, ensuring that care is taken not to scratch or damage the appliance. 

Always allow the appliance to cool down before performing any maintenance tasks or cleaning operations. For further details on cleaning, refer to the specific sections provided in the user manual.

### Cleaning Instructions for Contoured Areas and Cooktop

Regular maintenance of the contoured areas and cooktop is essential. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Cooktop**: The cooktop is not removable. Ensure you wait for it to cool down before cleaning.
2. **Recessed Areas**: Utilize a clean cloth to wipe down recessed and contoured areas. Avoid scouring pads or abrasive cleaners.
3. **Heads**: Clean the burner heads once they are completely cool to prevent any heat-related issues. Ensure no spills, food, or cleaning agents enter the gas orifice holder.
4. **Cleaning Precautions**: When cleaning, always turn off the light and wear protective gloves. A screwdriver may be necessary for certain adjustments.
5. **Light Indicators**: Ensure the light indicator is functioning properly. The light will turn on when the appliance is operational and off when it is not. 

### Troubleshooting and Service

- If the appliance shows error codes (e.g., F11), press CLEAR/OFF to reset.
