**Storage of Fresh Food**

Maintain the freshness of your food by adhering to its storage capacity and temperature guidelines. For optimal preservation, ensure the temperature is maintained at 18°C or lower. The fresh food storage capacity should not exceed the manufacturer's rating, and food should be stored for no longer than the recommended hours. Allow adequate airflow around the food items; ensure they are placed properly on the shelves to prevent food from being crushed or compressed. Avoid storing cooked food alongside raw food to prevent cross-contamination.

**Defrosting Guidelines**

When defrosting, be cautious about the thickness of ice buildup, as this can impact the efficiency of the process. The defrosting function should be utilized only when necessary and can take several hours based on the amount of frost. Do not manually heat items or use unapproved mechanical methods during defrosting, as this could jeopardize health and safety. Ensure any food being defrosted is protected and kept away from unapproved cleaning materials.
