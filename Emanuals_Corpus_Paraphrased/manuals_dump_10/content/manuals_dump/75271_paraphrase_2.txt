To broil:
1. Choose the UPPER or LOWER OVEN.
2. Press BROIL and then START.
3. Monitor the cooking progress and adjust as necessary.

### CONVECTION BAKING

Convection Baking enhances cooking efficiency by circulating hot air around food, making it ideal for even cooking and reducing cooking times. This setting operates between 170°F and 550°F, typically at 350°F.

To operate:
1. Select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN.
2. Press CONVECTION BAKE and then START.
3. The oven will indicate when it's preheating.

### CONVECTION CONVERT

The Convection Convert feature adjusts traditional cooking temperatures for convection use, typically reducing them by 25°F. This function works seamlessly with the COOK DURATION feature for optimal results.

### RAPID PREHEAT

Rapid Preheat is designed to speed up the preheating process, getting the oven ready for cooking faster. Set temperatures can range from 170°F to 550°F.

### CONVECTION ROASTING

Convection Roasting is suitable for cooking meats and poultry evenly by circulating heat throughout the oven. This function also operates between 170°F and 550°F, generally using 350°F.

### CONVECTION BROILING

Ideal for thicker cuts, this technique combines broiling with convection heat to ensure balanced cooking. 

### WARM OVEN

The Warm Oven function maintains food at safe temperatures (150°F to 190°F) after cooking is completed. 

### SLOW COOK

Slow Cooking allows for low-temperature cooking over an extended time, great for dishes like stews or roasts to prevent burning. This function can be set to high or low temperatures, and it is advisable to completely thaw food before using.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can optimize your cooking results and ensure food safety throughout the process.

### DEHYDRATING
Dehydrating food involves applying heat to remove moisture. The optimal temperature range for dehydration is between 100°F and 225°F, with a standard setting of 120°F. **Tips:** Preheat the oven before placing food inside. The extent of dehydration will vary based on the food type and its thickness. To utilize the dehydrating function, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press the DEHYDRATE option, and then START. To cancel or thaw frozen items like cakes, select the corresponding function and press START. When thawing, it’s important to ensure food is completely defrosted before cooking.

### BREAD PROOFING
Proofing activates the yeast in dough. The ideal proofing temperature ranges from 85°F to 100°F, with 100°F being the target. **Tips:** Preheat a shallow dish to maintain an ideal environment. To engage the bread proofing function, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press BREAD PROOF, and START. You can adjust the temperature as needed while the function is active.

### TEMPERATURE PROBE
The temperature probe is used to monitor the internal temperature of foods like roasts and poultry to ensure proper cooking. It operates within a range of 130°F to 210°F, typically targeting 170°F for optimal safety. **Important:** Utilize the probe only on foods that are fully thawed and ensure it’s inserted into the thickest portion of the meat, away from bones. To set up, select the UPPER or LOWER OVEN and choose the COOK OPTIONS. Set the probe temperature and start cooking. Upon reaching the set temperature, an alert will sound.

### MULTI-STAGE COOKING
This feature allows for multiple cooking stages or methods, including Convection and Proofing. To utilize multi-stage cooking, choose the desired oven, select MULTI STAGE, and follow the prompts. You can combine different cooking functions, adjusting settings as needed for each stage.

**CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS** 

Avoid using the self-cleaning feature while the oven is still hot. Ensure the temperature has cooled down before cleaning. When manually cleaning, wear suitable protective gloves. Do not interrupt the self-cleaning cycle or use any abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the oven's interior. Follow these maintenance guidelines: 

- Regular cleaning helps minimize the need for heavy cleanings later.
- Use a soft cloth for wiping down surfaces, avoiding any cleaners that might scratch.
- Heavy spillages should be cleaned up promptly to maintain the appliance's condition.
