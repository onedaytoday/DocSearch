### Instructions for Operating the Washing Machine

1. **Selecting Options**: Use the SPIN or RINSE HOLD function based on your preference. Indicate your choice by pressing the appropriate button, which will illuminate to indicate that the option is selected. If you wish to use the DELAY START function, that option will also light up. The selected program will show a countdown, indicating the time remaining until the wash begins.

2. **Sorting Laundry**: Before washing, sort laundry by fabric type and color. Items like tablecloths, hand towels, and bath towels should be grouped appropriately. Ensure to separate colored items from whites, as colored items can bleed onto whites. Only wash items with similar characteristics together and check for any fasteners like buttons or zippers.

3. **Washing Guidelines**: 
   - Wash white items separately from colored ones.
   - Use a suitable detergent for the load type (e.g., biological for whites, non-biological for sensitive skin).
   - Do not mix delicate fabrics with heavier items, and ensure wool items are washed according to specific care instructions.
   - Use the correct detergent (liquids or powders) according to your selection.

4. **Heat Settings and Cleaning**: Adhere to the temperature settings indicated by the clothing labels, and avoid using high heat for sensitive fabrics. Options include normal cycles, reduced cycles for a gentler wash, and cold washes for delicate items.

5. **Maintenance**: Regular cleaning of the washing machine is essential:
   - Disconnect from the power supply before cleaning.
   - Clean lint filters and other accessible parts regularly to prevent blockages.
   - Follow specific maintenance protocols based on your model.

6. **Troubleshooting**: If issues arise, consult the error codes displayed. Common problems like E10 or E20 generally indicate issues with water supply or drainage. Check hoses and connections for leaks or obstructions and redistribute laundry if it becomes unbalanced during operation.

7. **Service Information**: For further assistance, contact Service Force or visit their website for support. Ensure your details are handy when seeking service to expedite the process. 

By following these protocols, you will enhance performance, ensure cleanliness, and extend the longevity of your washing machine.
