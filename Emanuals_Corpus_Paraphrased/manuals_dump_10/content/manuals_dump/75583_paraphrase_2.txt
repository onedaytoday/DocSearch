The system includes coolers designed to operate within a temperature range of -2 to +8°C, featuring varying thicknesses and available with built-in options. This unit is constructed using pre-charged cooling technology combined with advanced assembly methods, ensuring high performance due to its pre-painted polyurethane insulation. It is also environmentally friendly, being free of CFCs and HCFCs, and features rounded internal corners. The fast-fit design improves installation efficiency and ensures airtight seals with PVC components.

The cooler accommodates high and low temperature applications (up to +43°C) using R404A refrigerant. For effective defrosting, the unit is equipped with a heating system that improves efficiency and minimizes internal heat loss. An IP54-rated internal lighting system is integrated, along with an ON/OFF switch, an internal light switch, and a thermostat for optimal functionality. The door is right-hinged, equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring an airtight seal and high thermal insulation, thereby reducing energy consumption.

This unit is compliant with HACCP standards and can be equipped with various accessories for enhanced usability:

- Technical data includes height and power specifications, with multiple voltage and phase options.
- Accessories available include aluminum shelves with polycarbonate tiers in various dimensions, a door microswitch, a graphic temperature recorder kit for HACCP compliance, and a printer for temperature logging.
