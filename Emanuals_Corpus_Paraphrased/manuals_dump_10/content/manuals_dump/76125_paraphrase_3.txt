**Correct Use and Maintenance**

To ensure optimal performance, regular cleaning is essential, particularly for grease and charcoal. Refer to the technical specifications and service guidelines for the appliance.

**Guarantee Conditions**

Wall mounting instructions are provided in section 39. Users must ensure that the appliance is correctly connected to an electricity supply in compliance with UK regulations. It is crucial that the cooker is operated per the manufacturer's instructions and that all safety standards are adhered to.

Ensure proper ventilation and clearance around the appliance, particularly if it is used alongside other fuel-burning devices. Non-compliance with the relevant regulations can lead to hazardous conditions.

Charcoal filters should be replaced every four months. When mounting, ensure the cover is secured clockwise. If the indicator light remains lit after replacement, consult technical service for assistance.

**Troubleshooting Symptoms**

Should any operational issues arise, check the following:
- Ensure the appliance is connected to a power supply.
