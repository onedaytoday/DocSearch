**Safety First**
Adhere to all safety instructions to minimize the risk of serious injury or property damage during operation. Prior to using this equipment, thoroughly read and understand the manual.

**Key Safety Precautions**
- Always wear safety goggles and hearing protection that comply with ANSI standards (Z87.1 and S3.19).
- Dress appropriately to avoid entanglement; remove loose clothing and jewelry.
- Operate in a safe environment free of electrical hazards, and keep your workspace organized and free from clutter.
- Inspect tools and machines regularly to ensure they are in optimal working condition, and replace or repair any damaged parts immediately.
- Utilize guards and safety features correctly to further reduce the risk of injuries.
- Disconnect the power before performing maintenance or repairs.

**Workplace Safety**
Maintain a clean work environment, keep children and untrained personnel away, and ensure everything is secured before starting the machine. Always feed the workpiece against the direction of tool rotation and follow guidelines to avoid overreaching or unsafe positions.

**Extension Cord Requirement**
Use an appropriate extension cord that can handle the tool's power needs without overheating. Refer to the cord chart for compatibility.

**Dust and Particulate Awareness**
Be aware that operating this tool may generate dust and airborne particles, including hazardous materials. Use proper respiratory protection to minimize exposure.

**Grounding Instructions**
This equipment must be properly grounded to prevent electric shock. Ensure that the outlet matches the machine's specifications and that grounding is intact. If there's any uncertainty about the grounding status of your outlet, consult a qualified electrician to verify.

**Final Note**
Consequences of failing to follow these safety rules can result in severe injuries. Always stay alert and ready, and avoid operating the machine when fatigued or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Remember, your safety is paramount; adhere to these guidelines and consult the manual for detailed operational procedures. Save these instructions for future reference.

**Extension Cords Overview:**  
When selecting extension cords, it is essential to choose the appropriate grounding type and ensure that the cord is sufficiently heavy to prevent overheating. Refer to diagram D-1 for guidance on length considerations. The cords should be used only as specified.

**Unpacking and Cleaning:**  
Remove items from the shipping carton while taking care to eliminate any protective coating using a cloth or a suitable thinner.

**Assembly Instructions:**  
For safety, do not connect the machine to the power source until it is fully assembled and you have read the entire instruction manual. Use the handwheel (A) for raising and lowering the cutterhead (B) as indicated in the assembly steps. Secure all components as directed.

**Lifting Components:**  
Care must be exercised when lifting the machine onto a workbench, as it is quite heavy. A minimum of four individuals is required to ensure safe handling.

**Installing the Top Cover and Dust Chute:**  
Attach the top cover (A) by securing it with three screws (B). Ensure the cover aligns properly and tighten the screws (D) and (E).

**Operational Controls:**  
The on/off switch is located at the front of the machine. Ensure it is in the OFF position before plugging in the power cord. In case of power failure, turn the switch OFF to prevent accidental startup.

**Depth of Cut Adjustment:**  
Adjust the cutterhead height by rotating the adjustment knob (D) clockwise to raise it and counterclockwise to lower it. Ensure that the adjustments are consistent with the requirements of the material being processed.

**Feed Speed Control:**  
Adjust feed speeds only when the motor is running. Do not change speeds during operation.

**Anti-Kickback Fingers Maintenance:**  
Before inspecting or cleaning the anti-kickback fingers, disconnect the machine from the power source. Regular inspections are necessary to ensure they are functioning correctly.

**Adjusting Belt Tension:**  
Disconnect the machine from the power source before adjusting the belt tension. Remove the necessary screws to access the tensioning system.

**Knife Replacement and Sharpening:**  
Exercise caution when handling knives, as they are extremely sharp. Disconnect power before removing any components, and wear gloves for safety. Clean and inspect all screws and locking mechanisms during maintenance.

**Constructing a Gauge Block:**  
Create a gauge block to set the height of the chipbreaker in relation to the cutterhead. Ensure it is properly aligned for optimal performance.

**Adjusting Chipbreaker Height:**  
Disconnect the machine and check the position of the chipbreaker relative to the cutterhead. Adjust as necessary to meet operational requirements.

**Infeed and Outfeed Roller Adjustments:**  
Adjust the height of both the infeed and outfeed rollers as stated above, ensuring that they properly align with the cutterhead. Secure adjustments with the appropriate screws.

By following these guidelines, users can ensure the safe operation and maintenance of the machine while achieving optimal performance.

### Adjusting Spring Tension of Infeed and Outfeed Rollers
To ensure that the infeed and outfeed rollers are appropriately tensioned while planing, care should be taken not to apply excessive tightness that could hinder the board's movement. The tension can be adjusted by manipulating the screws labeled (A) on the infeed side. There are four threads visible on the casting. To further increase or decrease the tension, adjust screws (A) as necessary. For the outfeed rollers, follow a similar procedure with the screws marked (B), of which only one thread will be visible on the casting. Adjust screws (B) to modify the tension accordingly.

### Adjusting Table Rollers
The table rollers (A) are critical for reducing friction as material passes through. The height of these rollers varies among different machine types. When working with rough lumber, the rollers should be set high, while for smoother materials, they should be set low. To make height adjustments, first, **disconnect the machine from the power source**. Use a straightedge (B) to align the height of screws (D) and (E) to achieve the desired positioning. **Important:** Ensure that screws (E) are adjusted correctly, which means they should either lead or follow to maintain proper alignment. Adjust by turning screws (E) clockwise or counterclockwise as needed.

### Adjusting Cutting Head Parallel to Table
The cutting head may need alignment relative to the factory settings. If it requires adjustment, follow these steps: **disconnect the machine from the power source**. Use a straightedge to ensure that the cutting head casting (B) makes contact with the top of the reference (A). The head casting should be positioned based on visual guides (C) and (D), allowing enough clearance for the assembly (E) to be disengaged from part (F). Rotate (F) carefully to align the other three corners. **Important:** This adjustment is sensitive, and each turn of the sprocket should not exceed one or two teeth to maintain precise alignment.

### Machine Use Instructions
For optimal operation, it's necessary to follow the outlined steps carefully. Use thin materials for each pass, adjusting the thickness at each step to ensure effective cutting. Occasionally clean the cutterhead to maintain efficient operation and reduce friction during use. To avoid uneven wear on the knives, do not feed the wood through the same position on the table repeatedly. Whenever possible, change the feeding position.

### Lubrication and Maintenance
Lubricate the machine regularly, following the outlined schedule. Refer to the indicated diagrams for correct lubrication points. Ensure the machine remains clean and well-maintained, wiping down surfaces with a cloth. Always wear ANSI Z87.1 safety glasses during operation.

### Failure to Start
If the machine fails to start, check for possible blown fuses or other electrical issues. For parts, service, or warranty assistance, contact Factory Service and authorized service stations through the provided channels. Warranty terms cover workmanship issues under normal use.

### Protecting Cast Iron from Rust
To clean and protect cast iron surfaces, use a combination of Scotch-Brite and WD-40, followed by applying TopCote for a protective finish.

### Service and Warranty
