**Drain Options and Features Overview**

The drain settings enable users to shift between various functions previously selected, allowing for adjustments based on item types or specific preferences. Time-saving options streamline the washing process. If the Time Saving mode is activated, it can be combined with the Delay Start feature, which provides the flexibility to set a delayed wash start time. Specific wash programs such as LINEN/EASY-C. at 60°C with a gentle spin, Energy Saving settings, and various fabric-specific options (Cottons, Woolens) can be selected.

**Memory Functionality**

**Rinse+ Feature**

The Rinse+ option enhances rinsing efficiency, particularly beneficial for sensitive fabrics such as Wool and Silk. Enabling Rinse+ triggers a cooling system that manages thermal inflow during the rinse cycle, optimizing water use alongside the Cotton, LINEN/EASY-C., and Energy Saving programs.

**Sorting Guidelines**

To maximize washing efficiency, sorting items based on color and fabric type is crucial. Items should be washed together (e.g., sheets with pillowcases) while separating colored and white garments. The washing machine is equipped to handle various fabrics, including easy-care synthetics, delicate garments, and woolens.

**Using Detergents and Conditioners**

When using detergents or fabric conditioners, it's important to follow the manufacturer's recommendations regarding dosages. The water supply should also be appropriate (Classes II to IV) based on load size.
