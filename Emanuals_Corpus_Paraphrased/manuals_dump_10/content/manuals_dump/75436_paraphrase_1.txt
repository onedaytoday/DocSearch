**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR FREESTANDING GAS RANGE**

Refer to the baking operating instructions. The unit should power up within seconds. If it needs to switch to broil, follow the operating guide and it should turn off shortly after.

To adjust the oven temperature to 300Â°F, ensure that the screws at the rear and front are correctly set. If a temperature increase is necessary, make the adjustments accordingly. For temperature reductions, similarly adjust the screws. Ensure the range is level by checking both the front and back, as well as the corners.

For cleaning purposes, refer to the cleaning instructions. If the gas supply requires disconnection, do so cautiously. It's important to disconnect the supply and slightly adjust the front to facilitate access to the supply line for service and cleaning.

Also, consult the anchoring instructions for stability. Ensure you review both service and operating instructions thoroughly. For assistance related to craftsmanship or any service issues, please contact the toll-free service number or write for further information. The rating label is typically located on the right-hand side at the front of the unit and specifies the necessary type of gas used.
