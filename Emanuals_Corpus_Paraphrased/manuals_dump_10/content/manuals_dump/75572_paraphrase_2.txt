The refrigeration system comprises coolers with a temperature range of -10 to -21°C, featuring integrated pre-charged cooling assemblies constructed with high-quality polyurethane insulation and a CFC and HCFC-free design. The units have rounded internal corners and utilize a fast-fit assembly method, ensuring airtight connections with PVC. They are compatible with R404A refrigerant and designed to operate efficiently in ambient temperatures of up to +43°C. 

To minimize defrosting cycles, heating elements are employed, which help maintain optimal performance and reduce ice buildup. The interior lighting, rated at IP54, includes an ON/OFF switch and a thermostat for convenient operation. The right-hinged doors are equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, providing a tight seal and superior thermal insulation, thereby enhancing operational efficiency.

Technical specifications, including height, HP, and voltage supply details, are provided for various models. Accessories include aluminum shelves with polyurethane tiers, door microswitches, temperature monitoring kits, HACCP advanced connections for cold rooms, plastic curtains for 65 cm door clearances, and basic refrigeration printers for temperature recording.
