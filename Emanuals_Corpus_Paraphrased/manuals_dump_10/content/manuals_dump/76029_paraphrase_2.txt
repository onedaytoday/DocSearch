Arthropods have existed for millions of years, and their adaptations are well-known. They often inhabit areas such as walls and staircases. This document outlines the functionality, specifications, and cleaning procedures for the device, including its accessories and after-sales service.

The cleaner features advanced, built-in technology that allows it to operate automatically, turning on and off as needed while navigating obstacles. Users can easily control its functions with designated switches.
