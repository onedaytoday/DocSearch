**Installation Guidelines**

**Attention:** Ensure adherence to the provided instructions. The warranty is applicable only if installation is correctly executed. This includes proper isolation from the electrical supply and adherence to the instructions regarding RCDs and circuit protection. Built-in cooking appliances should only be combined with those rated appropriately, ensuring they are placed with thermal insulation, especially concerning the rear and shelf areas. Maintain a reduced height at least to accommodate the plinth for built-in designs.
