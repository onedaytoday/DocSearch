When preparing food, it's essential to consider cooking times and methods to ensure thorough heating and appropriate thickness. Prevent splattering by monitoring the cooking process closely. For tasks like toasting bread, preheat the appliance and adjust the heat setting as needed. Foods should be placed in the center of the oven, directly above the heating element, particularly when utilizing the top shelves. The shelving system is organized from top to bottom, with at least one shelf space available between the food and the heating element to promote even cooking and browning.

During cooking, it’s crucial to adjust the position of the food as required. For specific items like Yorkshire puddings or cakes, placing them in the center of the shelf aids in optimal rising and cooking. Ensure there is sufficient space around dishes to reduce cleaning time. 

Defrosting processes vary; food should be thawed directly at a cooler temperature, particularly for meats. The rapid defrosting function can be used for thinner cuts like minced meat. Once defrosted, all food should be cooked immediately rather than left to cool again.

**Service Guidelines:**

For troubleshooting, if the appliance isn’t functioning correctly, wait a few hours for it to reset. Following provided instructions is key to successful operation. If there are mechanical issues, check connections and ensure the appliance is plugged in and set correctly, including the clock function, especially during error states.

If cooking is uneven, inspect the placement of the oven shelves and ensure they are installed correctly. Replace or repair the internal light if it fails. For cleaning, allow the appliance to cool before disconnecting from the power source. Use recommended cleaners that won’t damage finishes, and avoid abrasive materials.

Ensure that cleaning of shelves can be accomplished manually; some are dishwasher-safe but may feature a Stay-clean coating that should be maintained carefully. If wear occurs on the outer surfaces, seek professional servicing.

For installation and electrical connections, ensure compliance with relevant directives (e.g., EMC and safety standards). Proper earthing is crucial, and all wiring should connect to the supply securely. Follow local electrical installation regulations for safety.

Note: Always refer to the user manual for detailed operation and installation instructions to ensure safe and effective use of the appliance.
