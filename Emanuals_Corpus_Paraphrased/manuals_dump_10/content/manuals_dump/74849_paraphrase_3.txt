This device must be earthed. It should be connected to a supply that corresponds with the specified rating. The rating plate is located on the back cover. The supply should incorporate wiring compliant with ASTA (BS) standards. If necessary, the wires should be color-coded as follows: the earth wire is indicated by 'E' or a green/yellow color, the neutral wire by 'N' or blue, and the live wire by 'L' or red. It is important to ensure that the outer sheath is intact to prevent any risk of electric shock.

The switch used should comply with a higher rating than Type C. Type "Y" switching is advisable, and H05RR-F cable is recommended for this application. The yellow/green earth wire must have a larger cross-sectional area compared to the phase wires.

**Earth Continuity Test:**
- Check if the appliance is electrically sound and grounded.
- Ensure that the earth connections are clean and secure.

**Insulation Test:**
- Make sure the appliance is disconnected from the supply and switches are in the “ON” position.
- If readings indicate a fault, rectify the issue as needed.

**Socket Plug Inspection:**
- Ensure the earth connection is maintained and satisfactory.

**Commissioning Procedure:**
1. Set the control knob to MAX and then turn it back to MIN.
2. If the light extinguishes, follow the prescribed procedure.
3. Adjust the screw on the injector using a thin screwdriver until the desired gas rate is achieved.

**Conversion to LPG:**
