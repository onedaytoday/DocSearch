**Product Summary:**
This guide includes installation, safety, and maintenance instructions for your dishwasher. Always refer to the full manual for detailed information on care and troubleshooting.

### Initial Start-Up
To initiate operation, turn the power switch located at the 115V grounded supply to the ON position. It is crucial to allow the unit to run for a few minutes before observing its performance, particularly during the first three hours of operation.

### Normal Operation
Water must continuously flow from the assembly into the trough. As the water level rises to a certain thickness, the system will shut off automatically and then restart once it reaches the predetermined level. Factors contributing to sound during operation include cleanliness and the thickness of the ice cubes. Variations in cube thickness may occur between batches or even within the same batch, relying on the manufacturing process.

### Ice Dispenser Operation Care
To ensure optimal performance, the thickness of the ice should be adjusted as necessary. The factory setting allows for cubes of approximately standard thickness. If the cubes become too thick, adjustments can be made using the designated dial. It's important to let the machine operate for a period when making thickness adjustments. 

### Special Considerations
For optimal performance and to maintain warranty coverage, avoid exposing the unit to temperatures below 45°F (7°C) or above 110°F (43°C). Regular cleaning is essential for longevity and efficiency. Use only stainless steel cleaners specified for this purpose, avoiding abrasive materials or bleach-based products that can damage the finish.

### Maintenance and Cleaning
To keep the ice maker performing efficiently, regular cleaning and maintenance every three months or as necessary are recommended. Be sure to follow the specific cleaning instructions, particularly avoiding any materials that could scratch the stainless steel surface.

### Draining for Non-Use
If the unit is to be left unused for an extended period, ensure that it’s properly drained to avoid damage. Turn off the supply and follow precautionary measures to prevent electric shock during servicing.

### Troubleshooting
If you suspect the unit is malfunctioning, refer to the troubleshooting guide before calling for service. Check for common issues such as blown fuses and ensure that the surrounding environment meets operational temperature requirements. If service is necessary, contact the dealer from whom the unit was purchased and provide the model and serial number for assistance. 

In the event of any substantial issues, disconnect the unit before attempting any repairs to prevent injury or further damage.
