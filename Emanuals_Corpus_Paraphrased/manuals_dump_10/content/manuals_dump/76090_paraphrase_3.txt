### How to Maintain the On/Off Switch and Supply

To avoid injury when servicing the cleaner, ensure that the On/Off switch is turned off before doing any maintenance. Use a brush to periodically clean the brush roll and remove any debris. 

1. Switch off the cleaner and ground it to prevent accidental activation while working on it.
2. Loosen the screws on the brush roll and rotate it as necessary to access the threaded parts; begin with the first part, then proceed to the right.
3. Make sure to reassemble all components securely, fixing the screws back into place.

**Caution:** Always turn off the switch before any servicing. Keep the thermal sensor clear of debris and ensure suction is not obstructed. Regularly check the hose for any clogs or wear, which can impact performance. 

If suction is reduced, inspect and empty the cleanerâ€™s container as needed and ensure that the hose and plate are functioning properly. Adjust the height settings of the cleaner to optimize performance. 

For any replacements or if purchasing a new cleaner, contact customer service regarding warranty coverage for repairs and any related issues.
