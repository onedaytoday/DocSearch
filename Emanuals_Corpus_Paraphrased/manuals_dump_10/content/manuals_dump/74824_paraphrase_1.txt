### TURBO/FROSTMATIC Function Overview

The TURBO/FROSTMATIC feature is designed to rapidly cool fresh food products while preserving previously stored items. This function can be activated using the TURBO/FROSTMATIC button. When engaged, an indicator light will illuminate, showing that the cooling process is ongoing. This function operates continuously until manually disabled.

If the TURBO/FROSTMATIC is manually turned off after a certain number of hours, it will cease cooling. The light will turn off when the desired internal temperature has been reached. In the case of an alarm condition, an acoustic signal will sound when the temperature of the food rises above an acceptable threshold, indicating the warmest food items have been identified.

### Initial Setup and Operation

Prior to initial operation, ensure the appliance is upright and clean. Avoid connecting the appliance until it reaches the recommended cooling temperature of -18°C or lower. Activating the ON/OFF switch will trigger a warning tone and a flashing light, indicating the desired temperature is being pursued. Press the ALARM OFF button to disable the alarm.

Additionally, select the required cooling temperature (using the warmer or colder options). Always maintain the appliance at the recommended temperature for optimal food preservation. 

### Food Preparation and Cooling Guidelines

To achieve efficient cooling, ensure food items are properly packaged. Extra-thick wraps should be avoided to enable quick cooling. Frozen items should be evenly spaced to facilitate airflow. 

**Important Note:** If food item temperatures rise above -18°C, the appliance should be checked immediately, and adjustments made if necessary. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

To clean the unit, disconnect from the electrical supply. Use a mild cleaning solution to avoid damaging surfaces. Avoid harsh chemicals and always refer to the cleaning guidelines to maintain hygienic conditions.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions

For any operational issues or warning indications, refer to the troubleshooting section. Engage trained service personnel for repairs or further guidance if required. 

By adhering to these guidelines and instructions, you'll ensure optimal performance and safety of the TURBO/FROSTMATIC function and your appliance.

**Cooling Functions and Malfunctions**

This chapter addresses the cooling functions of the appliance, specifically the TURBO/FROSTMATIC feature. When the cooling indicator light is on, it may indicate that the appliance is not properly functioning. It's important to ensure that the appliance is adequately loaded with food, as overloading can disrupt its cooling efficiency. The door should remain sealed, and if heat from another source is impacting the appliance, adjustments might be needed.

For optimal performance, the TURBO/FROSTMATIC feature should be activated as necessary based on the section titled "Location." Ensure that the appliance operates at temperatures lower than 50°C when in use. If any warning lights indicate a malfunction, immediately disconnect the appliance from the power supply.
