### Yeast Dough and Baking Instructions

For yeast-based cakes and pastries, utilize the convection heating function for optimal results. Preheat the oven using the convection mode, ensuring that the cake is placed on the appropriate shelf.

When preparing cakes or breads, it’s essential to monitor the dough, as overcooking can lead to excessive rising or a burnt exterior. Always grease pans adequately to prevent sticking.

For items like gratins or apple desserts, preheat the shelf with convection heating. This applies to ready-to-cook meals, such as chips or other frozen items, ensuring they are cooked evenly.

#### Roasting Instructions

When roasting meat, use the rotisserie function for even cooking. Ensure meat is placed on the correct shelf and follow roasting guidelines specific to the type and size of the meat. It’s crucial to avoid burning by monitoring cooking times as indicated in the meat roasting chart.

For poultry, preheat the oven using convection settings, and ensure it is adequately cooked. 

#### Defrosting and Drying Functions 

For defrosting, unwrap food carefully and place it on a suitable shelf, avoiding excessive lengthening of the process. The defrost setting should be employed for meat and delicate items like whipped cream or fish.

The drying function can be employed with covered shelves to facilitate drying of fruits and vegetables, letting them cool overnight as necessary.

#### Preserving Methodology 

When canning or preserving, ensure jars are correctly positioned and not overcrowded. It is recommended to switch to a lower temperature once boiling is achieved.
