#### Important Safety Warnings:
To minimize risks of electric shock, adhere to the following precautions:
- Always power off the switch during service or when unplugging the unit.
- Ensure the appliance and all attachments are used correctly and only with recommended accessories.
- Avoid using the vacuum as a toy or allowing it to come into contact with hot surfaces.
- Do not operate with a damaged cord or while carrying the unit by the cord.

#### Electrical Supply Connection:
Before usage, verify the voltage indicated on the device matches your electricity supply. If permanently connecting the vacuum to an electrical supply, use a 13A fuse and ensure installation complies with safety standards. The cover should only be removed with a screwdriver if necessary.

#### Operating the Vacuum Cleaner:
Before using the vacuum cleaner, read all instructions carefully. To maintain optimal suction, avoid collecting items like loose clothing or matching items. Exercise caution around fire hazards, such as lit cigarettes or hot ashes, during cleaning.

#### Service Recommendations:
For cleaner servicing, contact the customer service number. Routine maintenance is essential to prevent reduced suction. If issues arise post-service, or if items like cloths or large debris are obstructing hoses, immediate action may be required.

#### Assembly Instructions:
To assemble, ensure the ON/OFF switch is in the OFF position. Attach the cover and secure it with supplied screws. Fasten the accessory hose to the back of the cleaner as demonstrated in the user guide. 

#### Maintenance and Cleaning:
- Regularly empty and clean the vacuum to maintain performance. 
- Follow suggested cleaning intervals to prevent overloading.
- For dusting and upholstery cleaning, utilize the specified attachments effectively to reach all areas.

#### Troubleshooting Guide:
If performance issues arise, the vacuum might require attention for blockages or part replacements. Possible causes can include:
- Hose clogs or wear leading to reduced suction.
- Height settings may require adjustment based on cleaning needs.

In case of persistent problems, refer to customer service for assistance, ensuring your product remains under warranty conditions.
