The EW3LDF65G S, EW3LDF65G W, and EW3LDF65G models are equipped with Wave-Touch technology and a sealed burner design, delivering impressive performance ranging from 16,000 BTU to 550 BTU for convection cooking. Their luxury-design lighting is both aesthetic and functional. The ranges include a variety of cooking modes, such as Perfect Convection and additional settings for warming, defrosting, proofing, preheating, and converting convection settings. 

For optimal performance, these dual-fuel freestanding ranges (LP gas only) feature professional-grade components including a precision BTU output, linear flow grates, and a self-cleaning capacity. 

Specification notes include the requirement for a dedicated 4-wire AC power supply with appropriate amperage and clearance for installation. It is recommended that the overhead cabinetry provides sufficient space above the range, and any modifications should adhere to regional safety standards.
