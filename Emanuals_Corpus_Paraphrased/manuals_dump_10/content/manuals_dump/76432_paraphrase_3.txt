**Sorting and Washing Instructions**

Sort items according to the following categories: whites, coloreds, synthetics, and other cloth items (e.g., towels, tablecloths, shirts). Generally, whites and lightly soiled synthetic items (cold wash) should be washed first, with recommendation charts indicating specific treatment for items like pillowcases. Avoid overcrowding the washing machine, as it can hinder proper cleaning.

For stubborn stains, pre-treat fabrics overnight with suitable products. Consider the use of bleach only for whites and colored items, following the specified guidelines. When finishing the cycle, ensure that the machine settings align with the type of fabric being washed, ideally using a temperature of 60Â°C.

For drying, utilize appropriate settings. Be cautious when drying synthetic materials; overheating can lead to fire hazards. Always adhere to the indicated safety measures to prevent shrinkage or creasing.

**Drying Conditions**

Ensure all items are sorted correctly before drying. Opt for normal drying cycles for cottons, while being mindful of the specifics for synthetics. For optimal results, avoid overloading the dryer, and watch out for the drying light indicators to confirm each phase of the cycle.

**Machine Operation**

When operating the machine, ensure to measure the correct amount of detergent and consider using a prewash option for heavily soiled items. The machine features specific buttons for selecting wash and drying options, along with indicators that guide you through the process. If any settings require adjustment, the selection mechanism allows for beneficial modifications as needed.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

Regular cleaning of the machine, including the emptying hose, is crucial for optimal performance. Disconnect the power supply before performing any maintenance and clean all necessary components as instructed. 

**Temperature Guidelines**

Refer to temperature guidelines for different fabric types to avoid damage, particularly for delicate materials. The mentioned cycles for washing and drying reflect compliance with international standards to ensure effective cleaning. 

For more complex situations, such as when water temperature falls below freezing, specific instructions should be followed to prevent damage to the unit.

The following highlights issues regarding E10, E20, and E40 supply types. If the service is closed (E40), then the E10 option or hose must be properly sealed. Additionally, if the selected option is E10, it is crucial to ensure the hose is adequately closed (E40) before proceeding. Any malfunction may occur if the hose is too full or improperly utilized, which can complicate the cleaning process. Be aware that stubborn residues in the hoses may require additional treatment.

If the RINSE HOLD option is chosen (E20), the hose may become obstructed, impacting the distribution of water. If necessary, contacting service support for assistance may provide crucial information regarding product usage and proper techniques.
