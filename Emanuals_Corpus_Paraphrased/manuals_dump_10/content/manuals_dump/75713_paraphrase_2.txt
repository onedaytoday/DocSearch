### Chillers GN Overview

Chillers GN efficiently cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly mitigating bacterial growth. The chilling process reduces the temperature of food from +90°C to +3°C, allowing for safe food storage without compromising quality. The system includes various operating modes, such as Soft Chilling (2°C) and regular Chilling (20°C), and is compliant with NF and UK regulations. Features include built-in UV sterilization (as an optional accessory), defrosting capabilities, a countdown timer, and service notifications. Each mode preserves and records operational data, which is important for HACCP compliance, especially in case of abnormal terminations.
