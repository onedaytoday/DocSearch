### Thermal Grilling

#### Overview of Thermal Grilling
Thermal grilling utilizes a combination of heat sources to cook food evenly, surrounding it with warmth. This method reduces cooking times and allows for closed cooking, ensuring foods typically prepared with other methods can be effectively grilled. Dishes like shepherd's pie can be heated thoroughly using this function.

#### Selecting Thermal Grilling
To activate thermal grilling, set the function accordingly and adjust the temperature between 140°C and 220°C. **Note:** Ensure the cooking chamber is closed for optimal results.

#### Important Considerations
Once the desired temperature is reached, the unit will indicate that cooking is in progress. Both the internal light and cooling mechanism operate according to this setting and will continue until the function is turned off.

#### Tips for Thermal Grilling
Foods should be evenly spaced and can be lightly oiled before grilling to aid in cooking. Ensure the higher shelf positions and selection are utilized for better results, especially for thicker items. Cooking duration can vary based on the thickness and type of food; refer to the cooking chart for guidance.

### Oven Clean Feature

#### Purpose of the Oven Clean Feature
The Stayclean coating within the oven helps manage splatters and food residue effectively.

#### Activating the Oven Clean Feature
Set the function to clean and adjust the temperature to 220°C. 

#### Important Notes
Once the oven reaches the cleaning temperature, an indicator will show that the cleaning cycle is active. The internal light will function as expected, and cooling mechanisms will engage when necessary.

#### Advice for Using Stayclean
Avoid using harsh cleaners or abrasive materials which can damage the coating. Proper cleaning with a designated Stayclean function should be performed periodically.

### Electronic Timer

3. Adjust the settings according to the desired cooking time.

### Helpful Tips for Food Preparation and Safety
When purchasing and prepping food, prioritize freshness, and follow safe handling practices to prevent bacterial growth. Ensure all food is properly reheated to the correct internal temperatures and maintain cleanliness to avoid cross-contamination. 

### Care and Cleaning Guidelines
Before cleaning, allow the appliance to cool. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials on the exterior. Follow specific cleaning instructions for various parts of the oven.

#### Cleaning Inside the Ovens
The Stayclean feature minimizes manual cleaning, though certain areas may require attention. 

#### Cleaning Glass Doors
To clean between glass panels, follow specified methods to avoid damaging components. Replace outdoor glass carefully to maintain proper insulation and functionality.

Always address any chips or scratches on glass surfaces promptly to prevent further damage. If extensive cleaning or repairs are needed, consult a professional service.

## Care for Stayclean Surfaces

Stayclean surfaces are designed to resist food splatters at temperatures up to 220°C. It is recommended to operate the oven at this temperature for at least an hour without food to optimize the Stayclean finish. Cleaning the Stayclean surfaces aggressively is discouraged as it may impair their function.

### Hints and Tips
To maintain their performance during higher roasting temperatures or when cooking meat, it’s advisable to brush off splatter rather than deep cleaning frequently. For effective cooking, ensure that any covering used is removed to prevent over-browning. 

### Replacing an Oven Light Bulb
The replacement bulb should withstand up to 300°C. Before replacing the bulb, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the electricity supply. Use a screwdriver to remove the cover, turning it counterclockwise. After replacing the bulb, reconnect the electricity and reset the clock if necessary.

### Troubleshooting
If your appliance is not functioning properly, please refer to the following guidelines. It is essential to verify that the switches are functioning and that the appliance is correctly wired. If the oven does not heat properly, turn it off and allow it to cool for a few hours before restarting. Consult the operating instructions carefully.
