**Cooking and Heat Distribution**

Ensure proper circulation of heat by allowing it to flow around the cookware and the food within the cavity. This aids in evenly distributing heat to the food. When serving, aim to position food items both on top and within cookware to maximize exposure to heat. This applies to all cooked foods, and it's important to cover them to maintain quality.

Always use recommended potholders when removing hot cookware or plates to prevent burns. Select the appropriate cooking temperature as indicated (HI for high, MED for medium, and LO for low) based on the type of food you’re preparing. If needed, adjust the temperature settings, and ensure that cookware is not overcrowded or warped to avoid uneven cooking.

**Preheating Guidelines**

Preheat cookware adequately before use, especially when roasting or baking items like meat and desserts. Ensure not to overcrowd the cooking area, as this may lead to incomplete cooking or overly rapid heating. Consistently follow the preheating instructions, allowing cookware to reach the necessary temperature. 

During searing, ensure that food is monitored closely to avoid excess smoke or grease buildup, which can lead to flare-ups. Use protective measures to handle spillage or fires safely, employing a fire extinguisher if necessary.

**Cleaning Procedures**

For cleaning, avoid abrasive materials that could damage surfaces. Perform routine cleanings to prevent residue buildup. Self-cleaning settings can be employed for effective sanitation; however, ensure proper ventilation during this process and avoid placing any objects that could inhibit heat distribution.

Use recommended cleaning solutions and follow instructions carefully when tackling stubborn spots. It is critical not to force components when cleaning or operating the self-cleaning feature, ensuring all parts are allowed to cool appropriately.

**Head and Grate Maintenance**

The cooktop should be cleaned consistently, with special care taken to avoid allowing debris to enter gas orifices. Following the instructions for cleaning grates and heads will help maintain functionality and safety. Ensure to allow all components to cool before cleaning and use non-scratching cloths or pads.

Refer to the cleaning and maintenance guidelines outlined in your manual to maintain the appliance's appearance and efficacy.

To ensure proper installation, align each component with the appropriate bearings on the front of the chassis. Listen for a click to confirm that each bearing is securely seated. If you hear the click, the bearing is correctly positioned. Note that the appliance should not be operated during self-cleaning, as this may pose serious safety risks, including potential hazards.

When using the self-cleaning function, the light indicator will turn on. The light switch can be found covered by a glass shield, which must remain in place during operation. To access the back cover, use both hands to gently pull it away, approximately an inch from the back, ensuring that you secure the shoulder screws correctly. Follow all instruction guidelines carefully while cleaning.

IMPORTANT: Ensure the oven is cool before servicing. Wear leather-faced gloves for protection, especially when handling the shield.

If an F11 error code or similar indicator light appears, it may suggest issues with the installation or proper clearance. If any house lights flicker or fail, press STOP/CLEAR to reset the system, and consult an authorized servicer if necessary.

For maintenance, ensure the gas supply is on and free of clogs. Clean any grates or burners according to the provided instructions.

During cooking operations and self-cleaning cycles, avoid factors that may lead to food burning or excessive grease buildup. Allow the oven to preheat appropriately, and maintain adequate clearance for meats to prevent curling. Follow the instructions for cleaning and avoid covering the meat during the process.
