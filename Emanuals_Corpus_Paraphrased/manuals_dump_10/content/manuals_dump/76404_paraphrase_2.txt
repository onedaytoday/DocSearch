### Troubleshooting and Maintenance Guide

To address potential issues, please refer to the instructions below regarding operations and notifications. The E10, E20, and E40 models will emit an acoustic alert every few seconds upon activation. If the service notification appears, ensure the E40 unit is securely closed. Proper installation and secure connections are essential.

For immediate resolution:
- If the hoses (E10 or E20) are clogged, clean them thoroughly. Ensure they are correctly installed and properly depressed.
- If problems persist, examine the selected options or phases in use. Redistribute issues may arise from using the hoses improperly; check for blockages and consult the guidelines provided earlier.

To maintain optimal functionality:
1. Inspect the hoses for any obstructions or damage.
2. Ensure that they are properly secured to avoid leaks.

If the service indicator remains lit or further issues arise, contact technical support with the necessary information about your model.
