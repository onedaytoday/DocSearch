The system features coolers with varying thicknesses designed to operate between -10°C and -21°C, equipped with built-in cooling solutions. This assembly comprises three units, pre-charged for performance and constructed with high-quality materials, including pre-painted insulation that is CFC and HCFC-free. The design includes rounded internal corners to enhance functionality and ease of installation. The fast-fit system enables quick setup and helps maintain airtight conditions, utilizing PVC for reliable sealing. The system can handle ambient temperatures of up to +43°C and utilize refrigerants like R404A, offering both high and low operating capacities.

Defrosting is facilitated through heated elements, which minimize frost buildup and optimize internal conditions, complemented by IP54-rated internal lighting. The unit features an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat for easy operation. It is designed with right-hinged doors that are rounded and airtight, contributing to effective insulation and reduced energy consumption. Compliance with HACCP standards ensures safe operation, complemented by shelving as an optional accessory.
