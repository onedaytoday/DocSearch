**Lighting the Grill: Ignition Procedures**

Before igniting the grill, ensure the supply is turned off. 

**Grill Burner Ignition:**
- The igniters are situated on the right side. Rotate the knob for the grill burner counter-clockwise to the ‘HIGH’ setting and immediately press the button. 
- You should hear a clicking sound indicating ignition. This may take a few seconds. If it doesn’t light within this time, turn it off and attempt to relight.

**Match Lighting Procedure:**
- If electronic ignition fails, you can use a match. Place the match at the designated location on the burner and light through the access point, rotating the knob counter-clockwise to 'HIGH'.

**Control Knob Layout:**
- To operate, turn the knob to 'HIGH' to preheat, or adjust to ‘LOW’ as needed.

**Clearance Specifications:**
- Ensure there’s sufficient clearance from the back and sides of the grill to prevent heat buildup. Maintain a safe distance from flammable materials to avoid fire risks.

**General Safety:**
- Always monitor for any potential hazards like grease buildup or stray heat sources. Ensure the grill is tested and positioned properly before use.

**Cooking Guidelines:**

**Rotisserie Attachment:**
- To attach the rotisserie, position the meat correctly and secure it with screws. Ensure that it’s tight to maintain stability during cooking.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**
- Regularly clean the drip tray and cooking grates. Allow the grill to cool before cleaning to avoid burns. Use a non-abrasive cleaner for stainless steel components to maintain their appearance.

**Igniter Access:**
- To access the igniter beneath the side burner, refer to the relevant instructions. Replace the battery as necessary.

**Troubleshooting Guide:**
