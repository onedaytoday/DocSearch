### Food Storage Recommendations

When organizing fresh food, avoid overcrowding shelves, as this obstructs airflow and cooling efficiency. Ensure meat is stored securely and separated from other items to prevent contamination. Avoid placing food in direct sunlight or near heat sources, like dishwashers, to minimize temperature fluctuations.

To maintain optimal conditions, refer to the "Setting the Temperature Control" section to avoid overloading the space, which can lead to inadequate cooling. Items should be stored in a manner that allows for proper ventilation. If the cooling system is inactive for extended periods (greater than three months), perform a thorough cleaning of the interior.

To clean effectively, utilize non-abrasive cleaners and cloths. Avoid using scouring pads or harsh chemicals, as these can scratch surfaces. Clean door seals and shelving regularly to prevent buildup.

### Warranty Information and Troubleshooting

For warranty inquiries regarding workmanship, contact Terry at L5V 3E4. Common troubleshooting issues may include improper cooling (indicated by error codes E7, E8, E9) or unusual noises. Ensure the appliance is grounded and that power hasn't tripped. If recent weather changes have affected your unit, check to see if the door is completely closed and seals are intact. 

Allow the refrigerator ample time to reach the desired temperature. If problems persist, consult the "Setting the Temperature Control" section or reach out to customer service. For issues with door seals or frost build-up, ensure they are clean and intact to enhance efficiency. 

### General Tips

Monitor the interior light and ensure food is arranged to optimize airflow. For any persistent issues, consider adjusting the leveling of the unit per the "Leveling the First Steps" section. For continuous problems, consult the "Refrigerator Features" section or contact support for assistance.
