This document discusses the cookware suitable for use with the heat sources outlined below. Various factors, including the type of cookware, its quality, and the specific heat level applied, affect the amount of heat transferred to the cookware, which can become sufficiently hot to cause burning. It’s essential to match the cookware type with the heating element and turn it on and off according to the specific requirements of the cooking process. The heat generated increases as the temperature rises; moreover, certain settings allow the burner to cycle on and off effectively.

Proper cookware should include materials such as aluminum, known for its excellent heat conduction, and copper, which heats quickly but may scratch easily. Stainless steel, while easy to clean, also conducts heat fairly well, while cast iron retains heat effectively but takes longer to reach cooking temperatures. Cookware with porcelain enamel surfaces may lead to scratching on smooth cooktops, while glass cookware is generally not recommended as it can be prone to damage.

When operating the heating elements, the control panel includes an LCD display to monitor settings. Higher temperature settings will typically engage heating elements at specific zones, allowing adjustments to be made for different cooking tasks. Users should be cautious with heat-sensitive items in proximity to the burners.

The preheating function is an essential feature, allowing users to achieve optimal cooking conditions before beginning the actual cooking process. Specific preset temperatures must be selected, and the correct controls must be engaged to initiate the preheating sequence. Notifications will indicate when the preheating cycle is active or completed, and the process can be canceled if necessary.

For cooking various food items, recommended temperatures are specified, with preheating typically set around 350°F (176°C). Grease management is critical, especially when roasting meats, to prevent flare-ups and ensure safety. Specific cooking conditions, including convection modes, must be strictly adhered to, maximizing efficiency and food quality.

Finally, users are advised to follow the operation and cooking instructions closely. These include timing and temperature recommendations to achieve the best results while minimizing the risk of foodborne illness.

**Convection Cooking Overview**

Convection cooking utilizes heated air circulating around the meat, enhancing cooking efficiency, especially for poultry. It is essential to preheat the oven to the appropriate factory settings (e.g., 350°F/176°C) for optimal performance. Food items should be prepared according to the recommended guidelines to ensure even cooking. To initiate the cooking process, select the relevant settings, including roasting or convection, and press the appropriate buttons.

**Roasting Instructions**

When roasting, ensure that food is positioned correctly on the designated rack, allowing grease to collect in the catch pan. Maintain the roasting temperature within recommended ranges (e.g., 325°F to 400°F) based on the type of meat. Utilize a roasting shield to prevent over-browning of poultry and follow the provided roasting chart for specifics.

**Internal Temperature Verification**

It is crucial to check the internal temperature of meats using a probe to ensure they are thoroughly cooked. Recommended temperatures include 170°F/76°C for poultry and at least 130°F/54°C for other meats. Always measure at the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bone contact to ensure accuracy.

**Safety Precautions**

Be mindful of food safety, especially regarding foodborne illnesses. The recommended handling and cooking guidelines ensure that bacteria are effectively eliminated.

**Slow Cooking Guidelines**

Select the slow-cook setting for optimal food preparation. Ensure all ingredients are fully thawed before cooking, and always cover them to maintain moisture. Start this function by pressing the necessary buttons.

**Defrosting Information**

For items like cakes and cheesecakes, use the defrost feature, allowing the food to thaw without applying external heat. This method ensures proper thawing according to USDA guidelines.

**Dehydration Feature**

Utilize the dehydration function to remove moisture from foods effectively, setting the appropriate temperature based on the food type.

**Baking & Proofing**

For baking, utilize the specific temperature settings for different recipes. The bread proofing feature ensures optimal conditions for yeast-leavened products, allowing dough to rise effectively.

**Cooking Instructions Management**

When using the oven, select the appropriate cooking functions, and follow on-screen prompts for settings. The oven can be set to activate on timed schedules, including during Sabbath/Holiday observances, ensuring all features are appropriately managed.

**General Usage Notes**

Remember to turn off the oven when not in use and monitor all settings closely to prevent any disruption in cooking processes.

### Note
Always consult the manual for specific instructions and settings. Adjust according to user preferences for optimal performance and safety.

**Cleaning Guidelines and Warranty Information**

To maintain your cooking surface, promptly clean up spills and food residues using a soft towel. Ensure the cooktop has cooled before cleaning to avoid scratches and damage. Avoid placing hot cookware directly onto the surface. For optimal results, apply the recommended CookTop Cleaning solution, making sure to clean thoroughly to remove heavy, burned-on residues. 

If food spills occur, turn off the cooktop immediately and allow it to cool before addressing the mess. High-starch foods require prompt cleaning. Use caution with cleaning products: avoid abrasive cleaners, bleach, or scrubbing pads that may scratch the surface.

To prevent grease buildup, clean the cooktop after each use. Be aware that improper cleaning or using incompatible cookware can lead to performance issues. Ensure the unit is set correctly for optimal heat distribution, and reposition items as necessary for even cooking.
