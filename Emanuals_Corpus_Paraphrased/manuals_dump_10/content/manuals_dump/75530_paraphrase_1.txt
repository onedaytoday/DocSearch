**Positioning and Cooking Guidelines**

**Centrally Positioning Food:** Place food centrally on the shelf to ensure even cooking. Consider the thickness of food items, which should be cooked thoroughly and lightly seasoned. Preheat the grill at high settings when toasting. Monitor cooking and turn the food as necessary.

**Grilling Chart:** For optimal results, maintain appropriate food positions according to the grilling chart provided, which outlines cooking times for different items like rashers, chops, and whole fish.

**Top Oven Instructions:** Ensure food is placed evenly to promote round cooking. Always preheat the top oven to the desired temperature before placing dishes inside.

**Adjusting Heat Settings:** When adjusting heat, ensure the top oven is cool before inspecting the light indicator. To turn the oven off, follow the designated procedure.

**Main Oven Heat Zones:** Understand that heat distribution varies within the main oven; the top shelf is slightly hotter than the bottom. Preheating is critical before cooking.

**Cooking Chart:** Provide a detailed chart for cooking various foods, indicating positions and approximate cooking times.

**Roasting Chart and Internal Temperatures:** Follow the guidelines for internal temperatures, and cooking times for various meats, ensuring to allow for proper cooking based on the type of food.

**Slow Cook Settings:** Ideal for tougher cuts of meat and budget-friendly cooking, slow cooking requires less heat and allows for improved tenderness. Use a meat thermometer and thaw food thoroughly before cooking.

**Food Preparation:** Cover tightly during slow cooking to maintain moisture. For soups and stews, bring the contents to a boil on the hotplate before slow cooking.

**General Tips for Slow Cooking:** Cool food before reheating; only reheat once.
