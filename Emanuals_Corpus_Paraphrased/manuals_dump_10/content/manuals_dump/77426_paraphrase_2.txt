### ATEX Compliance Instructions for IP221/SI and Amplifiers

For detailed instructions regarding the installations of devices rated for environments classified as ATEX Zone II, refer to the specifications provided for models TRL03ATEX21023X and TRL03ATEX21035X. These devices are suitable for operating temperatures between -40째C and +85째C and have a temperature classification of T4.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Certified Protection**: Ensure that installations conform to the specified protection standards. Any impacts that may compromise the device's protection level must be assessed, particularly in environments with combustible materials or chemical exposure.

2. **Inspection Protocols**: Regular inspections must be conducted to verify the integrity of the protection mechanisms employed. 

3. **Electrical Specifications**: The devices feature connection ratings, such as inputs of +16.27V and power ratings ranging from 0.4W to 1.42W, depending on specific configurations.

4. **Installation Compliance**: Installations should be executed by qualified personnel in accordance with the relevant standards (IEC 60721 Class 3M8/4M8, EN 50020).

5. **Maintenance**: Repairs must be carried out by trained technicians, ensuring that all components remain in accordance with ATEX regulations. Internal connections must only occur with certified devices, as outlined in the technical charts provided in the documentation.

6. **Cleaning Protocols**: Use a cloth for cleaning the devices, ensuring no risk of ignition from static charge build-up.
