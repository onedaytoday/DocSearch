To ensure a smooth and proper installation, **please carefully review these straightforward guidelines before beginning.** Confirm that your installation adheres to relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes. It is standard practice to ground electrical equipment, such as telephones and computers, to water linesâ€”this may occur within the building or externally. Such grounding can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, causing electrolysis that may impart a metallic taste or elevate the metal concentration in the water. This issue can be prevented by utilizing the specified materials. 

Any drain fittings installed should be made from plastic to provide electrical isolation from the building's plumbing system. The water supply should utilize unplated IPS (Iron Pipe Size) tubing, ensuring it is properly flushed before connecting to the fountain. When connecting the fountain, avoid soldering the tubes inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. If any damage occurs to the supply due to connection errors, warranty coverage may be voided. All service must be performed by an authorized technician.

**Important Notes for Installers:** The fountain should be securely mounted on a smooth, finished surface. Ensure the rough-in for the shut-off supply is properly aligned. CAUTION: This fountain is rated for specific PSI; be sure to manage supply pressure accordingly. Refer to the installation instructions for further details.

**Stream Height Adjustment:** The factory-set height may differ from your water supply. Adjust accordingly by turning the adjustment screw clockwise or counterclockwise, as outlined in the specifics.

**Troubleshooting and Maintenance:** Ensure the flow is clear; adhere to the "Stream Height Adjustment" instructions if needed. Connect the building's cold water supply using unplated copper tubing as specified. A service stop is not provided.
