The document outlines how to use buttons for various operations. Users can interact by clicking or right-clicking, leading to the available options being displayed. It is essential to notice the setup details and connectivity status when using the device. It is advisable to position the device vertically for optimal use while conserving power.

Starting with the whiteboard display, users can select teaching templates and backgrounds, which are essential for effective teaching presentations. The functionalities facilitate the secure use of wireless technology while moving the device. 

If issues arise, users should follow the installation instructions for compatibility with their operating system, such as Windows XP. It is important to press the appropriate buttons to execute desired operations, ensuring the current settings are highlighted for clarity. 

Users can begin or stop recordings easily, managing the content displayed on the whiteboard. This includes selecting options for different backgrounds—such as graph or musical themes—to enhance the teaching experience. 

When engaging with teaching materials, users can save and display selected lessons, managing playback efficiently. The system allows users to revert to previous displays or adjust selections as needed for smooth operation during presentations or recordings. 

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of functionality and connectivity, guiding users through effective use of the technology in a teaching environment.

Certainly! Here’s a paraphrased version:

The process of teaching involves selecting and displaying information about various teaching types. When a teaching type is selected, it appears as the primary display, allowing users to interact with either the previous or current selections through back or reaction operations related to other applications. If a teaching method is restored, it displays correctly as the background.

To edit a teaching entry, use the corresponding button. Notably, pressing this button replaces the previous entry with the newly edited one. The creation of recordings can be initiated to capture different teaching formats, with specific buttons designated for recording which respond each time they are pressed. The system supports various recording options, including a normal recording mode.

For creating teaching materials, users can choose background options and select the desired elements from the interface, modifying attributes like text style and thickness. Users can also adjust the layering of selected items by bringing them to the front or sending them to the back as needed.

When integrating a whiteboard background or choosing external backgrounds (like a PC), the system ensures that previously recorded materials can be utilized. Users can copy or transfer elements between different environments or formats.

In terms of functionality, the system runs on a lithium-ion battery and operates wirelessly, displaying status indicators when charging or during communication. Any issues with the connection or software installations should be verified to ensure proper operation.

Troubleshooting may involve checking the wireless connection, ensuring that communication is clear of interference, and confirming that other software does not obstruct functionality. The specifications highlight compatibility with various operating systems and include support for USB connections.
