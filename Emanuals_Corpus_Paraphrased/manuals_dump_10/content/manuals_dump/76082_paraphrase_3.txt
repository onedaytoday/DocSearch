**Instructions for Cleaner Use and Maintenance**

Thank you for selecting this cleaner. These instructions include essential information about the cleaner, its operation, cleaning procedures, troubleshooting, and the silencer. 

**Accessories and Safety Precautions:**  
Ensure the cleaner is properly earthed, especially in insulated areas. Avoid using the cleaner without the cover securely in place, as forcing it can lead to serious damage. Keep sharp objects, butts, or ashes away from the cleaner to prevent significant harm that might void the warranty. Only authorized service representatives should conduct repairs or maintenance covered by the warranty.

**Starting the Cleaner:**  
Before operating, ensure that the front and back covers are properly clicked into place. The hose should also be attached securely. To release the hose, simply press the catches located on both sides. Activate the cleaner using the On/Off switch.

**Achieving Optimal Results:**

**Replacing the Dust Bag:**

Ensure to replace the microfilter (Ref. EFH12) and clean any obstructed elements as needed. A HEPA H13 filter can also be purchased as an optional enhancement.

**Cleaning the Hose and Nozzle:**  
Periodically check for obstructions in the hose and nozzle. Should you encounter a blockage, the cleaner needs to be turned off. Use appropriate tools to clear any debris and maintain optimal suction functionality.
