To manually activate the FAST CHILL/-FREEZE function, press the recessed switch. The appliance features a child-proof shut-off mechanism, which can be disabled by holding the ON/OFF switch for a few seconds. If the appliance counts down from a preset timer and reaches the off position, it will turn off automatically. To stop the appliance manually, press and hold the ON/OFF switch for a few seconds.

In standby mode, the temperature will stabilize at +15°C, preventing unintentional closure of the door which could lead to mold growth. Ensure that the appliance is turned to the appropriate temperature incrementally, starting from +10°C to +15°C until the desired level is reached.

Warnings and alerts will activate if the internal temperature is too high or if thawing occurs. An indicator will flash and sound if the temperature exceeds 5°C above the selected setting. These alerts can be silenced after resolution of the issue. 

If thawing occurs, a warning will flash to indicate the highest temperature reached. If the temperature rises above -4°C, the thawing alert will deactivate. Technical issues indicated by error codes (F1 to F7) require a service technician to address.

The shelves within the appliance can be adjusted. The lowest shelf is best for meat products, while warmer spots should be avoided. Use a thermometer to check temperatures, especially if the appliance has been closed for an extended period.

Ensure that food is stored properly to maintain safety standards. Familiarize yourself with the specified capacity ratings to avoid overload. The FAST CHILL/-FREEZE function should not be exceeded beyond its indicated limits.

For cleaning, disconnect the power supply and wipe surfaces with approved cleaning agents; avoid bleach or harmful substances. The internal light can be replaced by unscrewing the cover, and caution should be taken to prevent electrical shocks.

In the event of persistent warning signs, or to troubleshoot functionality related to heating or cooling, consult the service manual or contact AEG Service for further assistance.
