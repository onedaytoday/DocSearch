The amplifiers in this home theatre setup provide exceptional sound quality. 

The front speakers are designed to distinguish between surrounding audio and the right surround channel. Notably, the sixth channel is represented by the active subwoofer, which conveys powerful effects such as explosions and crashes. This exciting performance is suited for Surround DVD-Logic systems and utilizes rear speakers for optimal experience.

When setting up surround sound, we recommend investing in a capable active subwoofer for enhanced bass response.

1. Connect cords to the appropriate outputs from the receiver to the active subwoofer.
