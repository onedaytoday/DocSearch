### Operating Instructions 

#### Controls
The AES system operates with various energy sources, including LP gas and AC/DC electricity. The operation is initiated using the Selector (A) switch, while the AES LED (C) indicates system status. 

#### Starting the Refrigerator
When starting, ensure the LP gas supply is secure and that the refrigerator is properly connected. If the AES LED (C) flashes red, this indicates a malfunction. Ensure that the gas bottle is full and correctly installed, then turn the switch (A) to "ON." If problems persist, check the supply lines.

#### Switching Between Energy Sources
When switching energy sources, turn off the refrigerator before changing settings to avoid efficiency loss. Maintain the refrigerator operational through either AC or DC sources for optimal performance. 

#### Winter Operation
For temperatures below 10°C, use appropriate winter covers to maintain cooling efficiency. 

#### Regulating Temperature
Allow several hours for the refrigerator to reach operating temperature. The thermostat (B) can be adjusted to maintain desired temperatures.

#### Travel Catch
Ensure the travel catch is secured to prevent food items from shifting during transport.

#### Food Storage
Store food items properly to prevent spoilage and maintain hygiene. 

#### Ice-Making and Defrosting
Ice can be made by adjusting cooling settings. Regularly defrost the unit to maintain efficiency, scraping off frost as necessary.

#### Cleaning the Refrigerator
Clean using a soft cloth and a mild cleaning solution. Avoid abrasive cleaners to prevent surface damage.

#### Turning Off the Refrigerator
To switch off, turn the switch (A) to "OFF," empty the unit, defrost, and clean as needed.

### Troubleshooting
If the refrigerator fails to operate, check the AES LED status and ensure connections are intact. Consult with a service technician if problems persist.

### Guarantee and Service

#### Installation/Building-In
Proper installation is crucial for optimal performance, particularly in avoiding heat exposure from other appliances. Ventilation is essential for maintaining efficiency.

#### Technical Data 
Ensure there is adequate clearance for air circulation, and securely fasten the unit to the vehicle structure. 

### Ventilation of the Unit 
Adequate ventilation is crucial, particularly at high temperatures, to avoid overheating the unit. 

This concise guide organizes all essential information for operating and maintaining your Electrolux refrigerator effectively.

Certainly! Here's a paraphrased version:

This design allows for easy inspection and repairs without needing to access the recess. If there are any stones located outside of the vehicle, the area should be sealed off to protect against winter conditions. This system should be constructed as per the indicated specifications, ensuring that the top is covered appropriately to manage heat transfer.

### Technical Specifications

#### LP Gas Connection
The LP gas setup must comply with the specified requirements. It is recommended to disconnect the supply when not in use. The installation should utilize a type of bottled gas with continuous operation and appropriate threading. **Note:** Push-on connections are not permitted. It is essential to adhere strictly to the specified connection types and ensure that they are securely sealed. The gas supply must be appropriately connected to the right-threaded coupling leading to the LPG control valve for effective servicing.

#### Electrical Connection
All electrical connections must follow current I.E.E. regulations. This includes the installation of an outlet and coupler compliant with BS4343/CEE17 standards. Make sure that the supply is properly earthed, and the outlet is easily accessible. The wiring should be color-coded as follows:
- **Green/Yellow** for Earth
- **Blue** for Neutral
- **Brown** for Live

In the UK, the respective connections should be as per these color codes: Green/Yellow to Earth, Blue to Neutral, and Brown to Live. 

**Warning:** This device must be earthed. When used abroad, ensure compliance with the local electrical ratings and standards.

For the power connection, the positive (+12V) should be wired directly to the house battery and fixed securely to the chassis. High-quality wiring is important for efficient operation, especially when linking to the vehicle's electrical systems.

#### Interior Light Bulb Replacement
To replace the interior light bulb, remove the cover by unscrewing it, then follow the proper instructions to fit the new bulb before securing the cover back in place.

### Technical Data
- Model: RM 
- Cooling Capability: Without LP, Capacity at 25°C
- Recess Height: To accommodate wheel housing dimensions.
