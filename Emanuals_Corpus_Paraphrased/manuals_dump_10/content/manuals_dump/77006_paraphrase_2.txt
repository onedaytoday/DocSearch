### MOUSE Interface Instructions

To engage the On-Screen Display (OSD), use the mouse to click or scroll. You can click the wheel to either clear the OSD or navigate through it. If the OSD is visible, clicking or rotating the mouse will change its priority. Ensure that the power supply is connected properly for functionality. If another device is connected, performance may not be guaranteed. Refer to pages 18 and 27 for OSD instructions.

### Unit Installation 

When mounting the VB-1000 UL, ensure that it is compliant with UL standards. Connect the included HV-C1000XG power supply cord and turn on the switch. If you need to turn it off, do so using the switch or disconnect the power supply. Accurate image projection requires adequate lighting; insufficient lighting may reduce focus quality. Configuring the DIP switches may be necessary; factory settings are indicated in the manual. Use the DIP switches to control power supply to various components, including RGB outputs.

### Operational Procedures

To power on the unit, press the [POWER] button on the wireless remote, which activates the LED indicator. If the switch is quickly turned off after being turned on, it may require several seconds to stabilize. The [LAMP] may take around 30 seconds to warm up, and you can adjust zoom settings using the [ZOOM TELE] and [ZOOM WIDE] buttons. Autofocus is activated with the [AF] button on the remote.

### Functionality Overview

For lighting adjustments, press the [LAMP] button on the remote to toggle it on/off. The [ZOOM TELE] button increases zoom, while the [ZOOM WIDE] button decreases it. Adjustments to contrast can be made by selecting the appropriate button on the remote, including options for negative/positive and color/b&w selections. 

### Wireless Remote Functions

The wireless remote allows for various operations. The OSD can be navigated via the wheel on the remote; functions can also be enabled or disabled from the OSD. For B&W image conversions, press the [COLOR/B&W] button to toggle between settings. 

### Special Functions 

Pressing the [POSI/NEGA] button on the remote alters the polarity of the displayed image. Additionally, the [IMAGE ROTATION] button allows clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of images. The [PAUSE] button temporarily suspends certain functions, including contrast and image selections.

### Advanced Image Adjustments

Utilizing the [F.A.M.] function reduces image artifacts by optimizing display quality. Control brightness with the [IRIS] buttons; [IRIS OPEN] increases brightness, while [IRIS CLOSE] reduces it. The [IRIS NORMAL] button returns the settings to default parameters.

This summary consolidates operational guides and provides an overview of functionality. Always consult the reference pages for detailed instructions and settings.

**AUTO FOCUS Operation**  
By pressing the wireless remote, the AUTO FOCUS function is activated automatically. Once the focus is achieved, the function is released, allowing for FOCUSFREE adjustment. This functionality may be influenced by external conditions such as bright backgrounds or reflected light. For manual adjustments, you can use the MANUAL FOCUS options [FOCUS NEAR] or [FOCUS FAR]. During operation, if the ZOOM buttons [ZOOM TELE] or [ZOOM WIDE] are pressed, the AUTO FOCUS operation will pause. If a new AUTO FOCUS command is received, the function resumes as expected.

**Preset Functionality**  
To store a preset configuration, press the [PRESET SET] button on the wireless remote and select the desired MEMORY NO. This setting can store parameters like IRIS and WHITE ON/OFF status, COLOR/B&W settings, IMAGE ROTATION, and CONTRAST settings. When the device is powered off, these presets will remain saved. To retrieve a preset, press the [PRESET CALL] button and select the MEMORY NO. previously set.

**Image Memory Management**  
You can save specific images by pressing the [IMAGE SET] button and selecting a MEMORY NO. To recall a stored image, use the [IMAGE CALL] button along with the desired MEMORY NO. This will activate the stored configuration within seconds.

**OSD (On-Screen Display)**  
The OSD provides operating status information and can be accessed by pressing the [MENU] button. This menu allows navigation using ARROW buttons, providing access to MEMORY and PRESET options. The OSD will turn off if the [MENU] button is pressed again.

**Color/B&W Functionality**  
To switch between Color and B&W modes, use the designated controls while ensuring the lighting conditions are optimal. Color selection can also be adjusted for static or moving images based on user preference.

**Iris Control**  
The IRIS settings can be toggled ON/OFF, allowing for adjustments based on environmental conditions. This enables the system to revert to factory settings if necessary.

**RS-232C Specifications**  
The device can be connected to a PC via RS-232C for communication. Proper connection and power supply management are essential during operation. Commands sent over RS-232C must follow specific formats for successful acknowledgment. Each ASCII command corresponds to specific functions such as AF, ZOOM, IRIS, COLOR/B&W, and more.

**Lamp Replacement Instructions**  
If the lamp fails or begins to dim, it’s essential to replace it with a compatible model such as JR12V50W AKM/5EZ-1. Ensure the device is powered off and cool to the touch before attempting replacement to prevent burns. Carefully remove the cover by unscrewing it and follow the designated steps for installation. Always handle components safely to avoid damage.

### TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES

**Symptoms and Verification:** Review the following items for irregularities. If any issues are detected, refer to the corresponding countermeasures for the office or branch.

1. **TV Connections:** Ensure the TV is properly connected to the AC power source. Verify that the power switch is turned ON.
2. **Display Issues:** If the display shows only white or black, check if the power switch is ON but the display turns OFF immediately. Try turning the switch OFF for a few seconds before switching it back ON.
3. **Focusing Adjustments:** For focusing discrepancies, switch between TELE and WIDE modes and use the AUTO FOCUS feature. If issues persist, ensure the correct wireless format (PAL or NTSC) is selected.
4. **Brightness Concerns:** If the image appears excessively bright or shows stripes, this may be due to interference affecting the TV or CCD, particularly with LCD displays. Adjust the brightness settings manually.
5. **Tone Adjustments:** Change settings for brightness tones as necessary.
