### Operating Instructions and Maintenance Guide

To activate the cooling function, press the (C) button until the display shows +8°C. The H indicator may briefly appear during this process. If the appliance experiences a malfunction, ensure that it is positioned on the lowest shelf, avoiding contact with other items. The placement of food items is crucial; they should be arranged to facilitate air circulation, helping maintain optimal temperature and humidity levels across the shelves.

#### Warning! 
To avoid electrical shocks, make sure to switch off the appliance before performing any cleaning or maintenance tasks. Disconnect the power supply and use the designated cleaner as indicated on the product. Always focus on the areas specified in the cleaning section, particularly the back and interior spaces.

If malfunctions occur, consult the troubleshooting section. Issues such as the appliance getting too warm or too cold may be caused by blown fuses or defective components. For temporary fixes, adjust the thermostat to a warmer setting, and ensure all food items are stored correctly—food should be covered and allowed to cool.

#### Cleaning and Defrosting
Regular cleaning is essential for optimal performance. Ensure the appliance is powered off before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaners and avoid contact with electrical surfaces to prevent shocks.

For defrosting, switch off the appliance and remove any food. Clean the shelves and interior components thoroughly. After defrosting, ensure that food items are properly stored in airtight containers to avoid frost accumulation.

#### Ice Cube Preparation
To prepare ice cubes, fill the designated trays, ensuring not to exceed the recommended fill line. Allow adequate time for the ice to freeze. Be mindful of not placing high-pressure containers in the freezer, as they may burst.

Always refer to the recommended storage practices for various food items. Some foods require pre-treatment to maintain freshness. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe operation and maintenance.

### Final Note
Proper use and maintenance of the appliance will enhance its longevity and performance. Always consult the user manual for specific operational guidelines and troubleshooting instructions.

Frost accumulation may occur in the compartment, potentially affecting performance. It’s advisable to monitor the thickness of the frost. When it becomes excessive, defrosting is required to maintain efficiency; this can be done using the tools provided. 

To defrost, remove food items and layers of newspaper from the compartment, and then turn off the power. Upon completion of the defrosting process, ensure to clean the compartment thoroughly, using appropriate cleaning materials. 

**Warning:** Always ensure the appliance is switched off when cleaning to avoid electric shock risks. 

The display will indicate the current and desired temperature settings. The desired temperature will flash until it is reached. Pressing the appropriate buttons will allow you to adjust settings. 

Regular maintenance and cleaning are crucial for optimal performance. In case of any malfunctions, refer to the troubleshooting section or consult a service professional. For further assistance, please contact Service Force via their website or phone.

### COOLMATIC Function Overview

The COOLMATIC function is designed for efficient cooling and operates at a selected temperature of +15°C. It allows for the proper storage of food while preventing excessive frost build-up. The yellow indicator light will notify you when this function is active. To adjust settings, use the designated buttons, confirming that the desired temperature is achieved. 

Regularly check food packaging to ensure airtight conditions for optimal freshness. If any issues arise during operation, consult the troubleshooting guidelines or reach out to customer service for support.
