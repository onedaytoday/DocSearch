### Wall and Information Cleaning: General Warranty Coverage

Please refer to these instructions carefully to ensure compliance. Failure to follow these guidelines may lead to serious injury or damage to property. This includes adherence to the installation requirements and grounding procedures outlined in the accompanying documentation. It is essential that the appliance is installed by a qualified technician in accordance with the National ANSI Z223.1/NFPA standards.

In case of an emergency, it is vital to disconnect the appliance from the power supply at least 32°F (0°C) for a minimum of several hours prior to servicing. During cleaning or cover removal, be cautious around the appliance to prevent injury, and ensure that children are kept at a safe distance from the area.

**Important Safety Warning:** Do not touch the interior oven burner or the walls of the oven until they have fully cooled as they may be hot enough to cause burns. Use appropriate clothing while operating the oven to avoid heat-related injuries. 

In case of grease fires, smother the flames with a fire extinguisher or a suitable blanket. Unopened food containers must not be heated as they can burst. 

**Operational Instructions:** Ducts should remain unobstructed to ensure efficient operation. Do not touch any hot parts during usage, as contact may lead to burns. Ensure oven racks are arranged while the oven is cool to optimize heat circulation around food.

**Grounding Instructions:** It is crucial to read and retain these grounding instructions. The appliance should be correctly grounded to prevent electric shock. Never cut or remove the grounding prong from the power cord plug. Follow the detailed installation instructions for correct grounding.

**Fire Safety:** Always position oven racks before preheating. Allow space for cookwares to ensure adequate air circulation. Avoid overcrowding within the oven, as this can disrupt heat distribution and lead to uneven cooking.

**Cooking Guidelines:** Preheat the oven as needed, keeping in mind that different foods may require varying temperatures. Monitor food closely while cooking, turning as necessary for even results. 

**Cleaning Instructions:** Ensure the oven is free of grease to prevent fire hazards. For self-cleaning models, follow the specified self-cleaning method and use only recommended cleaning agents on the appliance’s surfaces. 

Be cautious of the cleaning methods used to avoid damage to decorative finishes. Avoid abrasive materials which can scratch surfaces. 

**General Maintenance:** Adhere to proper cleaning protocols regularly to maintain optimal appliance performance. Use soft cloths and appropriate cleaners to prevent accidental damage. 

By following these guidelines, you will ensure the safe and effective operation of your appliance.

### Cleaning Instructions

**General Guidelines:**
