By adhering to these instructions, users can ensure the oven operates efficiently and safely.

### Boost and Pizza Baking Functions

**Boost Function Overview:**  
The Boost function elevates the temperature in the cavity rapidly by selecting the appropriate cooking function. If additional heating is required to achieve the desired temperature, the Boost function will be employed. This function may precede other cooking settings during the preheating phase.

**Pizza Baking Function Overview:**  
Designed for specific foods like pizza, this function ensures optimal cooking by applying heat to both the top and bottom. After selecting the Pizza function, confirmation is indicated by a flashing light. If temperature requirements aren’t met, you may need to adjust settings.

**Important Notes:**  
Once the selected temperature is achieved, an indicator light will signal readiness, while the internal light will remain active until the oven is turned off. Cooling mechanisms activate after operation to avoid excessive heat buildup.

**Hints and Tips:**  
Position food centrally on the cooking shelf to ensure even cooking and browning. For best results, directly place dishes on the designated shelf. Using heavy enamel cookware can enhance browning, while lighter or polished cookware may yield different results.

### Main Oven Fan Cooking

**Fan Oven Preheating:**  
The fan oven generally requires preheating to optimize cooking results. If preheating isn’t conducted, it’s recommended to lower the cooking temperature by 20–25°C.

**Batch Baking:**  
For batch baking, ensure items are evenly spaced on shelves to allow proper heat circulation. The fan oven can accommodate various dishes, and confirm selections as indicated by flashing lights.

### Main Oven Conventional Setting

**Conventional Oven Usage:**  
This setting is ideal for traditional baking tasks like casseroles and gratins, focusing heat from the top and bottom. Select this function and wait for the temperature to stabilize.

**Oven Cooking Chart:**  
Adjustments may be necessary based on the type of dish; refer to specific cooking charts for temperatures and timing.

### Rotitherm Fan Assisted Grilling

**Rotitherm Function Overview:**  
The Rotitherm function combines fan assistance with grilling, enhancing cooking efficiency and ensuring even heat distribution. Select this option for optimal performance, especially with enclosed foods.

**Cooking Notes and Tips:**  
To maximize results, position food with sufficient space for air circulation. Be mindful of cooking times based on the specific food type.

### Main Oven Grill

**Grill Safety and Operation:**  
When the grill is operational, surfaces can become extremely hot, necessitating caution and the keeping of children at a distance. Confirm grill settings and ensure heat distribution for uniform cooking.

### Bottom Heat Function

**Function Overview:**  
The Bottom Heat function applies heat primarily from the base, suitable for certain dishes requiring direct contact with heat sources. Confirm this setting prior to use.

**Cooking Considerations:**  
The type of dish, its thickness, and material will affect cooking efficiency. Darker or heavier cookware can improve browning, while lighter dishes may have different outcomes. 

**General Tips:**

The defrost feature is designed to thaw foods without applying heat, making it suitable for items like cakes with frosting or cheesecakes. To activate defrost mode, use the function selector and confirm the time needed. The display will flash, indicating that the function is active, along with the internal light. To deactivate the function, switch it off after the cycle completes.

**Important Notes**
- Monitor the food during the defrosting process; the light and fan will function as needed.
- Thawing meat is more efficient at cooler temperatures. Use this function for thin cuts or small portions, aiming for several hours for optimal thawing.
- Ensure that all meat and poultry are thoroughly defrosted before cooking; do not leave defrosted food unrefrigerated or refreeze it without cooking first.

**Food Purchasing and Preparation Tips**
To prevent bacterial growth, observe proper food safety practices when purchasing and preparing food. Always select the freshest items, store them properly insulated, and promptly refrigerate perishable goods. Follow cooking instructions carefully to ensure food is heated thoroughly and evenly, and use a meat thermometer to verify that meat reaches safe temperatures (60°C to 80°C, depending on the type).

**Main Oven Light and Functions**
When cooking, the main oven light will be activated with selected functions. If needed, the light can be manually turned off. The oven features a safety cut-off that automatically shuts down the oven when certain temperature thresholds are exceeded, ensuring safety during use.

**Child Safety Function**
This option allows for enhanced security by locking both the main and secondary oven functions. To activate the child safety lock, follow the specified procedure involving simultaneous button presses.

**Secondary Oven Usage**
The second oven heats from both the top and bottom, making it ideal for versatile cooking tasks like baking cakes and casseroles. Similar to the main oven, the functions can be selected via the function selectors, and the light will activate during operation.

**Conventional Oven Setting**
The conventional setting allows for cooking dishes that require heat from both the top and bottom. Confirm the selection through the appropriate functions and ensure temperatures are monitored during the cooking process.

**Telescopic Runners Use**
When using telescopic runners (if available), ensure proper placement in the oven cavity for stability. Follow guidelines for shelf positioning to maintain even cooking and accessibility.

**Grilling Safety**
Ensure that children are kept at a safe distance from hot surfaces. When using the grill, the door must remain open; closing it will deactivate the heating elements.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**
Allow the oven to cool down before cleaning. Use recommended cleaning materials and techniques to preserve the appliance's finish. Avoid cleaners that contain bleach or abrasive substances to maintain the integrity of the surfaces. For best results, utilize soft cloths and designated cleaning agents. 

Follow these guidelines for safe, efficient usage and care of your oven and defrost functions for optimal cooking results.

### Cleaning Inside the Ovens

To maintain **Stayclean surfaces**, ensure proper care by following the manufacturer’s instructions when cleaning. For optimal performance, set the oven to around 220°C and run it for an hour to enhance the Stayclean finish. Regular cleaning with recommended products prevents food splatter buildup. During roasting, consider the cooking temperature to minimize splashing and avoid direct contact with meat. Cover the meat to prevent over-browning while ensuring it cooks thoroughly.

### Removing and Replacing Wire Runners

When cleaning the oven, it may be necessary to unhook** wire shelves** from the top and remove them to access the cavity and back. Ensure shelves are cleaned regularly, especially if used frequently.

### Cleaning the Triple Glazed Door Glass

For cleaning inner and middle glass panels, use suitable household cleaners. If the inner glass needs replacement, access it from the rear of the door. Take care when handling to prevent chipping or scratching.

### Replacing an Oven Light Bulb

The oven light activates during specific functions. If a bulb needs replacing, turn off the electricity supply and let the oven cool down. Use a screwdriver to remove the cover and replace the bulb, ensuring everything is reassembled correctly.

### Troubleshooting

If the oven is not functioning properly, consider the following: check for tripped circuits, ensure the timer is set correctly, and confirm that the selected cooking function is appropriate. If issues persist, allow the oven to cool for a couple of hours.
