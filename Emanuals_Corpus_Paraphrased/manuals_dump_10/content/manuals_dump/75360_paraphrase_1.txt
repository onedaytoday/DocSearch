The heat finishing function, along with defrosting, enables cooking without using the oven's active operation. This feature is particularly useful for dishes like gratins, where top cooking is essential. The system allows food to be cooked consistently, making it ideal for various food items that require specific cooking conditions. The cooking process operates effectively even when the oven is closed.

To use the cooking shelves, ensure they are positioned straight and flush against the back of the oven, with a clear space in front. Each shelf should be properly aligned with its corresponding wire supports. Caution is advised when young children are present, as some functions should only be activated during food preparation.

The cooking light turns on and off as needed. This helps maintain proper heating and prevents spills from impacting the oven's cleanliness or causing fires. Preheating is vital for some foods, while other items can be cooked directly without preheating. Items like cakes covered in icing, cheesecakes, and more, may benefit from this functionality.

When using the roasting chart, it’s important to allow ample space around the food to ensure even cooking. The recommended cooking temperatures range from 160-180°C, depending on the type of meat and desired internal temperatures. Ensure that food items are properly spaced to facilitate airflow and reduce cleaning time.

For effective defrosting, this function can aid in thawing various meats or delicate items within a shorter timeframe. Once defrosted, it’s crucial to cook the food immediately to ensure safety and prevent spoilage. Adhering to cooking charts and guidelines will optimize the cooking process.
