**IQ-Touch TM Overview**

The IQ-Touch TM is designed to accommodate both dietary and religious practices within the community. To activate or deactivate the appliance, simply press and hold the specified button for several seconds. The display will indicate when the Sabbath mode is active for health-related purposes. Once Sabbath mode is engaged, all sound alerts and other functions will be disabled until it is manually turned off.

For the Perfect TM model, users need to turn it off by following the appropriate on/off sequence found in the IQ-Touch section of the manual. It should stay off long enough for a reset, which usually takes a few hours. To ensure proper operation, avoid connecting or disconnecting the power supply during use. The appliance will produce operational sounds, which are normal and indicate that it is functioning correctly.

When using any cleaning chemicals, ensure they're appropriate for the unit. Do not introduce cleaners with bleach or abrasive materials, as they can damage the surface.

**Shelf Features and Maintenance**

The shelves are designed to hold fresh food securely while enabling easy access. The shelves may need to be adjusted to accommodate various food items and should be cleaned regularly. For optimal performance, ensure the fridge is not overcrowded and that air can circulate freely.

**Sound Indicators**

Operational sounds, such as hissing or clicking, are typical during cooling cycles. These sounds are normal indicators of the appliance working efficiently. If any unusual sounds are heard, please consult the troubleshooting section of the manual for assistance. 

**Water Filtration System**

To maintain the water filtration system's efficiency, replace the filter every six months or as indicated by the glow of the filter status light. Regular maintenance ensures high performance and clean water output. 

**Cleaning and Care Instructions**

For best results, avoid using abrasive cleaners. A soft cloth should suffice for routine maintenance. If there are any issues, refer to the service guide for troubleshooting or contact support for assistance.

Always follow guidelines for handling the appliance with care to prevent damage.

**Common Operational Issues**

If the LED lights are not functioning, check the power supply to ensure it is connected correctly and that any relevant fuses are intact.
