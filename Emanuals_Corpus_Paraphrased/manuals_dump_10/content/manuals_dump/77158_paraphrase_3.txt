**Testing the MSR 15D1 OUCHCOMPUTER USER GUIDE**

To test the USB MSR (Magnetic Strip Reader), access the MSR interface. Double-click the HID entry to verify connectivity. If the ID is displayed, the device is functioning properly. You can also connect it to the touch computer. The software for character display and settings can be found at www.elotouch.com, which includes support for bright characters and international character sets (X Y), with a font size of 5.5 mm (W) and 10.5 mm (H).

**FPR Testing Specifications:**

Access the FPR (Fingerprint Reader) by double-clicking to verify functionality. You can choose between USB 1-D, low-cost USB, and USB-SSI interfaces, both of which are compatible with the device. The performance standards for 2-D scanning (PDF417) can be implemented using the USB interface, with power supply requirements of 5V and typical values of 0.25A.

**General Touch Computer Testing:**

To connect and set up the touchscreen, ensure the software recognizes the COM ports (COM1, COM2, COM3). Use the appropriate app and fields to register the connections. For USB configuration, refer to the specific section in the user guide. After establishing connections, the system should confirm connectivity in the relevant fields.

**Wireless LAN Connectivity Testing:**

For wireless operation, verify the touch computer supports wireless USB with B/G/N protocols. Double-click the network settings to ensure wireless connectivity is detected. If the wireless interface is not initialized, troubleshoot the setup.

**Mounting Options:**

The rear-facing LCD can be mounted using the DVI-D interface, employing standard VESA MIS-D E835074 fittings. The HDD/SSD can be mounted based on standard specifications. Ensure any third-party peripherals are properly attached.

**Safety and Maintenance:**

To minimize the risk of electrical shock, power down the touch computer before cleaning. Use a grounded, 3-wire cord for connection. Prevent damage by avoiding improper cleaning agents. Ensure compliance with safety regulations regarding circuit boards containing lithium batteries.

**Recovery Process:**

If you need to restore the touch computer to factory settings, there are two methods: using the built-in recovery software for XP and POSReady users or the recovery DVD. Follow the prompts for each method to successfully recover the system.

**Reassigning COM Ports:**

After recovery, you may need to reassign USB ports. Access the hardware settings to view the current assignments. Correct any discrepancies based on recommended configurations.
