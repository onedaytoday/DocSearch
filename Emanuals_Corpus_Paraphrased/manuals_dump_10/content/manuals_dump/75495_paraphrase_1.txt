- If malfunctions, cracks, or other anomalies occur, ensure you disconnect the appliance from the power supply immediately. 

**Child Safety:**  
- Keep children away from the cooking areas to prevent accidents, as the induction cooktop can generate high heat quickly.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**  
- Induction cooktops must be kept clean to function effectively. Avoid using rough or abrasive materials as they can scratch the surface. Clean spills immediately to prevent damage.

### Switching Off

To turn off the cooking function, select the appropriate cooking mode using the touch controls. When utilizing the Heating-Up Function, the cooking zone heats to the highest temperature before reverting to the previously selected heat setting. The Heating-Up Function allows for rapid cooking—after achieving the desired temperature, it will automatically adjust back to the selected level. Each cooking zone indicates the selected temperature, and if the cooking surface is switched off, the corresponding indicator light will deactivate.

If you engage the heating-up function, ensure you monitor the cooking closely as it operates at higher temperatures initially. When cooking is completed, the function will switch off automatically and emit an acoustic signal. For added safety, a Child Lock feature can be activated to prevent accidental operation. To disable it, continuously press the relevant control.

Additionally, when cooking times are set, you can use the TIMER feature. The cooking zone will turn off after the predetermined time elapses, providing a convenient notification.

### Heat Adjustment Chart

Refer to the cooking heat chart for guidance on suitable temperatures and durations for various types of cooking, including heating, steaming, and browning. Maintain vigilance to prevent food from burning or sticking.

### Cleaning Instructions

Cleaning induction cooktops is facilitated by their quick-response to activation. Residue should be cleaned promptly, as burnt food can be more challenging to remove. Use suitable cleaning agents and ensure the cooktop is cool before cleaning. A soft cloth or sponge is recommended for maintenance.

For stubborn residues, apply a gentle abrasive cleaner while the surface is cool. Avoid scratching the glass-ceramic surface during cleaning.
