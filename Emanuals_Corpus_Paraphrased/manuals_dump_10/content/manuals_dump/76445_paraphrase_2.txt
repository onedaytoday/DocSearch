**AM Black Overview**: The presence of an option may determine whether items are either washed or chosen manually. Traditional powders can be applied directly to fabrics, while traditional liquids should be measured and applied to the designated areas of compact powders and liquids. Always adhere to the instructions provided for use. Fabric conditioners are designed to ease care and maintenance, and are categorized for washing machines. Refer to the guidelines for proper usage of MAX Bounce conditioning sheets. 

**Washing Instructions**: To ensure the correct execution of the wash cycle, differentiate between synthetic and heavier fabrics, as improper settings may lead to risks. After washing, the drying process can be adjusted based on the fabric type as illustrated in the accompanying chart.

**Drying Options**: If items such as towels need to be refreshed, use the START/PAUSE feature to manage the drying cycle effectively. Avoid creasing by ensuring a proper drying technique. For optimal results, distribute items evenly within the drum. 

**Eco-Friendly Settings**: The various washing cycles (e.g., SOAK, STAIN-Action) should be selected based on the fabric type and conditions necessary for treatment. Choose the additional rinse or delayed start preferences if desired. 

**Troubleshooting**: In scenarios where operational issues arise (manifested by warning lights), follow the corrective measures outlined for each error code (E10, E20, E40). Proper ventilation and placement of hoses can prevent operational failures. 

**Maintenance Cleaning**: Regularly maintain and clean both the interior and exterior components of the washer, including the hoses and detergent compartments. Ensure proper hose connections and check for blockages to facilitate smooth functioning. 

In summary, consistent adherence to outlined procedures and maintenance guidelines will promote optimal performance of the AM Black washing system.
