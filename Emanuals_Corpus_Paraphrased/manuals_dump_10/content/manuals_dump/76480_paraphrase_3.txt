### Food Storage Recommendations

To maintain freshness, food should be stored at correct temperatures without overcrowding shelves, which can impede airflow and cooling. Meat should be securely wrapped and kept separate from other foods. Ideally, storage temperatures should be at or below 40°F. An efficient operation requires proper spacing for air circulation around items. Avoid overloading the storage area as this may trap food, leading to spoilage or freezer burn. Items that freeze slowly, such as certain vegetables, should be placed strategically on the shelves to ensure even freezing.

### Energy-Saving Strategies

Maximize energy efficiency by utilizing natural light and minimizing the use of heat-generating appliances like ovens and dishwashers. Improve insulation around cabinetry to maintain consistent temperatures and reduce energy consumption.

### Understanding Appliance Sounds

Familiarize yourself with the typical sounds of high-efficiency appliances, as some may become more pronounced during operation. Common sounds include:
- A buzzing, whooshing, or humming from airflows.
- Hissing noises from the defrost heater.
- Clicking or popping as the unit cycles on and off.

Note that certain sounds are normal and indicative of proper functioning. If any unusual or excessive noise occurs, it may indicate a problem that requires attention.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Regularly clean the condenser coils (on certain models) to improve efficiency. Remove any build-up that can hinder performance. Use appropriate cleaning tools and methods as outlined in the user manual. For bulb replacements, ensure proper safety measures are followed.
