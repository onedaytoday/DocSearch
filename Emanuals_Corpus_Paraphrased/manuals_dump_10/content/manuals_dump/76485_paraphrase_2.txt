#### Safety Precautions
Follow all safety warnings to prevent serious hazards such as fire or electric shock. Ensure proper grounding of the washer by connecting it to an electrical supply with a grounding type plug. Avoid using bleach or other household cleaners that may produce harmful reactions. These instructions are designed to help you operate the washer safely and efficiently.

To prevent accidents, particularly involving children, ensure they are supervised around the washer. Teach them about its safe use and storage. Unpack the washer cautiously, as children could hide in or play with the packing materials.

To reduce the risk of electrical shock, ensure all installation and servicing adhere to the provided guidelines.

#### Operating Procedures
- **Sorting:** Before washing, sort items into appropriate categories (e.g., light and dark colors, heavy and light fabrics). Do not mix items that may attract lint or produce excessive wear.
- **Loading:** Ensure loads are balanced, avoid overloading, and load heavy items separately to prevent issues during washing.
- **Use of Detergents:** Follow recommendations for detergent and bleach use. Measure accurately to avoid residue on clothing and ensure optimal cleaning.

#### Dispenser Usage
To utilize the dispenser drawer, open it fully before adding products. Allow sufficient time for bleach or fabric softeners to mix with the wash. 

#### Stain Treatment
Promptly treat stains according to their type (e.g., oil-based vs. water-based). Use prewash sprays or cleaners as needed. For best results, follow manufacturer guidelines on stain removal and avoid mixing incompatible products.
