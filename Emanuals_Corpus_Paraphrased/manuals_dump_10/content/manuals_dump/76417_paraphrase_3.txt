IS SOMETHING NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY? First, ensure that the device is plugged in and that the ON/OFF switch has been activated. Check if the hose is securely connected; it should not be kinked or blocked. If the hose appears damaged or obstructed, inspect it and, if necessary, replace it. 

Next, if the load is unbalanced, redistribute the items within the drum to allow for even washing. Also, verify that the detergent being used is appropriate for the machine and that the correct selection settings are made. If the cycle is not completing as expected or if stubborn stains remain, consider applying a more suitable treatment.

Make sure the machine is level and resting securely on the ground; ensure that the load is distributed evenly. If difficulties persist, refer to the service information provided on the P0042 plate for assistance or contact customer service for further guidance.
