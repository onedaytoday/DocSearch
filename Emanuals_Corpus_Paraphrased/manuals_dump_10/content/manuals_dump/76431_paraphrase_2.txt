**Washing and Drying Instructions**

To ensure optimal results, please adhere to the provided instructions for sorting laundry. Separate items into the following categories: whites, colored garments, synthetics, and normal soiled items, including shirts, towels, tablecloths, and sheets. Avoid washing whites and dark colors together to maintain their brightness. New colored items should be washed separately to prevent color transfer. Treatment options for stains include washing with appropriate detergents or bleach, but use bleach only on whites and colorfast items.

When using the dryer, avoid overloading to maximize efficiency. Synthetics may require lower drying temperatures to prevent damage. Specific drying and washing settings may include options for items like bathrobes and towels. For stubborn stains, consider soaking items overnight before washing. Always follow the manufacturer's guidance regarding water temperatures and detergent amounts.

**Maintenance and Cleaning Guidelines**

Regularly check and clean components to prevent clogs and maintain performance. Disconnect from the power supply before performing any maintenance. Ensure that the emptying hose is correctly attached to avoid leaks. If any error codes or malfunctions occur, such as E10 or E20, refer to troubleshooting sections for guidance.

**Emergency Procedures**

In case of persistent issues, consult the troubleshooting guide or contact customer service. Ensure any clogged hoses are cleared and reconnect securely. Familiarize yourself with the water supply and drainage requirements, as specified in the provided technical information.

**Final Notes**

Always refer to the product’s rating plate for maximum temperature settings and compatibility. Follow the guidelines for transporting and unpacking the appliance to avoid any damage. Each load type may have specific requirements; ensure correct settings are selected for best results.

**Instructions for Installation and Operation**

Ensure the porthole is properly positioned, and verify that the hose is connected securely. This may involve adjusting the washer-dryer placement or lowering the unit. It is crucial to avoid any obstruction around the washer-dryer or connections, and to incorporate the necessary locking mechanisms. If needed, consult the manual for operational guidance.

Never attempt to connect the water hose without first checking that it is free from defects and properly positioned. If the hose is too short, a specialized extension should be purchased. When using the hose, ensure it is securely attached and that the alignment is correct to avoid leaks.

For single-phase V supply connections, ensure grounding compliance as per local regulations. Should the supply need replacement, contact the service provider for assistance.
