### Autodrying of Synthetics (Continuous Cycle) 

To activate the continuous autodrying function for synthetic fabrics, select the appropriate options using the control buttons. Ensure that the load is not overly packed to prevent inefficiency during the drying process. This setting is ideal for synthetic fabrics, and it is important to turn off the machine when drying is complete.

#### Drying Instructions

Sort items before washing according to the following categories: whites, colors, synthetics, and specific fabric types like towels and tablecloths. It is recommended to wash new colored items separately to prevent color transfer. Whites should be washed with other whites to maintain their brightness.

Treat stained items accordingly, using bleach for whites and color-safe products for colored fabrics. For high-efficiency drying, ensure that synthetics are packed loosely to enhance air circulation.

When utilizing the washer-dryer, consult the provided charts for optimal water and detergent types. Follow the instructions for additives like starch if needed. Use the appropriate temperatures for cotton and synthetic items as indicated.

#### Maintenance and Cleaning

To ensure optimal operation, regularly clean the lint filter and other components as outlined in the manual. Disconnect the machine from the power supply before cleaning. Clear any blockages in the drain hose and ensure that all connections are secure.

If the washer-dryer shows error codes (such as E10 or E20), refer to the troubleshooting section. If problems persist, reach out to customer service for further assistance.

### Technical Specifications

The device specifications, including water supply requirements and fabric care guidelines, are located on the ratings plate and in the user manual. Always ensure hoses are correctly installed and not kinked to maintain performance efficiency.

**Positioning and Installation Instructions for Washer-Dryer**

Ensure proper positioning of the washer-dryer by adjusting its feet tightly, which are in compliance with operational requirements. When installing, position the water supply hose carefully, ensuring it is connected with the correct threading and length to prevent kinks. If you require a longer hose, consult the appropriate building authority for a suitable option.

Make sure the outlet is properly connected to a water supply. The supplied hose should form a U-shape and be approximately 50 cm above the ground. Take precautions to prevent the hose from becoming pinched or obstructed.

Should there be any damage to the power supply setup, it must be immediately inspected and replaced by qualified personnel.
