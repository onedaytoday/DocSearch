**Selection and Sanitization Instructions for Washers**

When selecting cycles, please utilize the "DEEP CLEAN" setting, particularly for heavily soiled items such as towels and clothing. It is advised to set the internal heater to 60째C (140째F) or higher for optimal performance in eliminating bacteria and preventing carryover. Using bleach or stronger chemicals may be necessary in specific cases. 

Please note that NSF International conducts third-party testing to ensure health and safety standards. According to NSF P172, the performance of family-sized washers is evaluated based on these criteria. The internal heater should reach the prescribed temperature, ideally set to heat during operation.

Ensure that you consult the instructions for specialty cycles. Use the "CASUAL" cycle for lightly soiled items and "DELICATE" for more sensitive fabrics. For those with allergies or asthma, careful selection of these cycles is crucial.

To maintain freshness and cleanliness, regular washer cleaning is recommended. It is advisable to clean the washer manually once every so often, as routine cleaning helps with preventative maintenance.

For heavily soiled activewear, select the appropriate options to minimize damage and ensure thorough washing. Use of chlorine bleach is not recommended for synthetic materials.

The washer will indicate the selected options automatically. Confirm your choices and adjust settings as necessary. Be aware of ECO settings and their implications for energy and water conservation.

For effective stain removal, adhere to guidelines regarding the use of various cleaning agents and products. Proper stain treatment is essential for optimal performance. 

To prevent risks associated with harmful chemical reactions, avoid mixing bleach with other household cleaners. Always follow safety protocols and seek to understand the specific recommendations for each stain type.

In summary, properly select and maintain washer settings for effective sanitation, and be conscientious of safety protocols regarding cleaning agents.

### Cleaning Protocol

#### Preventative Cleaning Routine

**Caution**: To prevent entrapment and tip-over hazards, keep children away from the washer during operation. 

**Refreshing and Cleaning the Washer**: To maintain cleanliness and freshness, activate the *CLEAN WASHER* cycle once a month. Follow the prompts or manually select this cycle according to the previously provided instructions. Utilize either the *TIDE WASHING MACHINE CLEANER* or bleach, but never both simultaneously. 

1. **Preparation**: Before starting the cycle, ensure that all items are removed from the wash drum and the main wash dispenser.
   
2. **Cleaning Cycle**: For the clean cycle, select either fresh water or bleach, following the *CLEAN WASHER* guidance. 

**Important**: If prompted to add bleach, ensure that the bleach is the only liquid in the dispenser cup. Avoid mixing bleach with any household cleaners, as this may produce harmful fumes, potentially leading to serious health risks.

#### Additional Preventative Cleaning

1. **Dispenser Drawer Maintenance**: Clean the dispenser drawer area monthly. Remove any buildup from the prewash, bleach, and main wash compartments. 

2. **Daily Maintenance**: Check for any items that may have fallen into the washer. If children are present, ensure to secure the area around the washer to prevent any accidents.
