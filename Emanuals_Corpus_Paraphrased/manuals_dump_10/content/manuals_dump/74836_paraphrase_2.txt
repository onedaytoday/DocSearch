### Tests and Certifications
This appliance has been certified by UL and NSF/ANSI, including Chilltherm compliance, ensuring operational safety standards are met.

### Specification Plate
The specification plate is positioned on the right side of the device. Serial number: YWWXXXXX should match the model information.

## OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
**Initial Operation:**  
Prior to first use, clean the appliance. Heat to 320°F (160°C) to prepare surfaces and remove manufacturing residues.

**Heating Guidelines:**  
Keep the cover closed during heating to optimize temperature maintenance, achieving ranges from 68°F to 446°F (230°C).

### Automatic Control Features
Set cooking times using the built-in clock and adjust parameters with specified buttons. Indicators will illuminate upon reaching designated cooking states, delivering auditory signals when complete.

**Switch Operations:**  
Power switches control various functions and settings, ensuring the appliance operates correctly. Follow operational switch sequences to start, stop, or adjust cooking settings.

For completion and maintenance of the appliance, consult the troubleshooting section for a comprehensive guide on common issues and their resolutions.

**SOFT Function Operation and Heating Guidelines**

In the SOFT mode (soft deactivated), the appliance heats food using an efficient heating method ideal for products with high thermal conductivity, minimizing cooking time and preventing burning. When the SOFT mode is activated, heating adjusts according to the type of food being cooked, allowing for thorough heating without sticking. The display shows the clock (AZ) and cooking time (AT). 

The HACCP-compliant appliances can be optionally analyzed with the cooking tool THERMACAM. HACCP indicators (C) provide feedback during operation. The user can control cooking settings using buttons for specific functions (T, D, Z) that will flash under certain conditions. To temporarily pause cooking, pressing (TT) halts the process, while the functioning can be manually turned off using switches (DT) and (ZT).

**Mechanical Tilting and Operational Procedures**

The appliance includes a mechanical tilting option activated via switch (H) and (S), allowing for proper food positioning. User interaction involves smoothly rotating the swivel outlet either clockwise or counterclockwise to facilitate operations and safely empty the contents.

**Operational Guidelines**

For effective cooking, specific temperatures must be adhered to:
- **Red Meat**: Start at 391°F (200°C) then reduce to 230-320°F (160°C).
- **White Meat**: Begin at 392°F (200°C).
- **Poultry**: Initial browning at 284-320°F (140-160°C) before lowering to 176°F (80°C).

Food placement should ensure there is at least one inch between the item and the appliance to prevent burning. The SOFT mode should be selected for delicate items to avoid sticking.

**Cleaning Protocols**

After use, the appliance should be cleaned with proper tools to ensure hygiene and function. Allow the machine to cool before cleaning and wipe surfaces with a soft cloth, avoiding abrasive materials that could cause damage. Grease should be carefully managed with commercially available cleaning products.

**Troubleshooting**

If anomalies arise during operation, the appliance will emit acoustic signals to indicate issues. Users can acknowledge these alerts using button (Q) and may need to contact service for specific error codes (E1, E2, etc.), indicating various service needs.

**Periodic Maintenance Guidelines**

Regular care ensures optimal performance. Use appropriate cleaning agents to prevent buildup of grease and other residues. Caution should be taken not to use abrasive tools that could damage surfaces, and any food items or liquids that can create harmful reactions should be treated with care.

Please adhere to the operational guidelines set forth in CFR regulations to prevent malfunctions and ensure the longevity of appliances.
