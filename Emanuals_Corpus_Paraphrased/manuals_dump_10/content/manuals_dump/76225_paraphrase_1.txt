### LAVAMAT SOUPLESSE Information

Dear Customer,

Please refer to the Safety section for vital information regarding the operation of your appliance. This includes warnings and alerts for both owners and users. It is essential to adhere closely to these operational guidelines, especially during the winter months, to ensure safe and effective functionality.

For any technical issues, the AEG service team is available to assist you with your appliances and related services. Be aware of the specific instructions regarding water usage for inflow and drainage, ensuring all connections are correct to avoid overheating or electrical hazards.

Safety precautions are critical, especially to prevent child suffocation. Children should not be allowed to operate the appliance without supervision. Repairs must only be performed by qualified specialists to avoid damage or malfunctions.

When handling the machine for cleaning, maintenance, or transport, always disconnect it from the power supply and ensure hoses are properly managed to prevent leaks and electrical shocks.

For optimal washing performance, please adhere to the recommended washing cycles and use products as instructed. The pre-wash feature is beneficial for lightly soiled items, while special cycles cater to different fabric types, including cotton, delicate fabrics, and wool. 

Select cycles carefully based on the fabric type, such as:

- **Cottons/Linen**: For standard cotton and linen items.
- **Energy Saving**: Optimal for slightly soiled items.
- **Easy-Care**: Suitable for synthetic fabrics.
- **Delicates**: For gentle washing of fragile items.
- **Wool**: Can be hand-washed or machine-washed according to specific care instructions.

Be sure to follow proper sorting techniques before washing, separating colors and types to prevent damage or discoloration. The machine can handle various loads, but avoid overloading, as recommended amounts vary by fabric type.

For further guidance, please refer to the specific operational instructions associated with each washing mode, ensuring optimal performance and care for your garments. Thank you for choosing Lavamatic.

To initiate the cycle, press the START/PAUSE button (START/PAUZE, MARCHE/PAUSE). The current phase of the washing process will be displayed. You can adjust the cycle duration based on the fabric type and the laundry load. To stop the machine, press START/PAUSE (START/PAUZE, MARCHE/PAUSE) and then turn the power OFF (UIT, ARRET). If further action is required, options such as PUMP OUT (POMPEN, VIDANGE), SPIN (CENTRIFUG., ESSORAGE), or GENTLE SPIN (KORT CENTRIFUG., ESSOR. DELICAT) can be selected, followed by START/PAUSE (START/PAUZE, MARCHE/PAUSE). 

If RINSE HOLD (GEEN CENTR., SANS ESSOR.) is selected, the START/PAUSE button will flash. Once a cycle is complete, the END (EINDE, FIN) light will illuminate. 

For regular laundry, various wash programs are available, including COTTONS/LINEN (WITTE/BONTE WAS, BLANC/COULEURS), ENERGY-SAVING (ENERGIEBESP., ECONOMIQUE), EASY-CARES (KREUKHERSTELLEND, DEFROISSABLE), and EASY-IRON (STRIJKVRIJ, SANS REPASSAGE). Additional options include PRE WASH (VOORWAS, PRELAV.), SHORT (KORT, COURT), and STAIN (VLEKKEN, TACHES).

For wool and delicate items, use the WOOL (WOL, LAINE) cycle with cold water (KOUD, FROID) and appropriate settings for pre-washing and stains.

For cleaning the machine, use a soft cloth, avoiding abrasive materials, and ensure the cleaning agents are suitable. Regular maintenance is essential, and a thorough cleaning is recommended at least once a month.

Warning! For safety, switch off the machine before attempting maintenance. If issues arise, such as error codes (E10, E20, E40), refer to the troubleshooting section and consult Customer Service if needed.

Underperformance may be related to loading issues, clogged hoses, or improper settings. Follow the instructions to rectify these issues as detailed in the operational guide.

For emergency emptying, ensure the machine is powered off and take necessary precautions to avoid scalding. Carefully detach the emptying hose and allow any residual water to flow into a suitable container. Always secure the hose and attachments properly after use.

For child safety, be cautious with controls and ensure they are locked when not in use.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.
