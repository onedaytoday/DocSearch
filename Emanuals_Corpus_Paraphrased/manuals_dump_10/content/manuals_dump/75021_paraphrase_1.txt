**CHECKING THE GRILL**: Inspect the grill with the attached light, ensuring it turns on when the control is activated.  

**CHECKING THE HOTPLATE**: Verify that the crowns are properly seated. To ignite the hotplate, set it to the highest setting and press the button immediately. Hold the button for a few seconds, then release it. The flame should ignite. Turn off the hotplate post-check.

**CHECKING LID SHUT-OFF DEVICE**: Set the hotplate to its lowest setting. There should be a gas supply to the hotplate. Turn off the hotplate; the gas supply should cease when the hotplate is off.  

**CHECKING THE SECOND OVEN**: Rotate the thermostat counterclockwise and press the ignition button. The flame should activate as the gas is released.
