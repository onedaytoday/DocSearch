The following guidelines apply when using the machine with or without the grass catcher, specifically for the B&S model.

**Preliminary Setup Before Operation:**
Ensure that all adjustments are properly made. Check the seat connection using the four screws; once adjusted to the desired position, verify that the tire pressure is appropriate. If necessary, unscrew the rear adjustment to align it correctly.

**Refueling with Oil and Fuel:**
**CAUTION:** Avoid open flames near the fuel tank when checking contents and do not smoke while refueling. **Note:** Use the appropriate fuel type as per specifications. Remove the cover using a screwdriver and check the fuel levels against the MIN and MAX indicators. Ensure the cap is properly secured when operating the machine.

**Installing Protective Equipment for the Grass Catcher:**
**WARNING:** Never operate the machine without the safety mechanisms in place, especially the grass catcher.

**Checking Safety Devices:**
Confirm that all safety mechanisms are functioning properly. If any issues arise, contact a licensed service provider for immediate assistance.

**Inspecting the Braking System:**
Ensure that the braking system is efficient. If performance is lacking, consult a licensed service provider.

**Blade Inspection:**
**WARNING:** Ensure the blades are correctly sharpened. Use protective equipment when handling the blades to prevent injury.

**Operating the Machine:**
**Starting the Engine:**
**DANGER:** Only start the engine in a well-ventilated area. Exhaust gases are toxic. Engage the choke if starting from cold conditions, adjust the speed settings to SLOW or FAST as needed, and move the ignition to ON before starting. Release the choke shortly after the engine starts.

**Operating Without Mowing:**
**WARNING:** Ensure the machine is in a safe, traffic-free area when moving without mowing. Keep speed settings in check and engage the clutch as necessary.

**Grass Cutting Operations:**
To maintain optimal performance, avoid cutting heavy debris like stones and branches. Ensure the grass catcher is functioning correctly and adjust cutting height according to ground conditions to prevent clogging.

**Emptying the Grass Catcher:**
Only empty the grass catcher when the machine is turned off. If it becomes jammed, cease operation and clear the blockage.

**End of Mowing Operations:**
Once mowing is complete, bring the machine to a complete stop, switch off, and ensure that all settings are returned to the SLOW position.

**Cleaning and Storage:**
After use, clean the grass catcher and wheel area thoroughly to prevent build-up. Store the machine in a weather-protected area.

**Inactivity for Extended Periods:**
**WARNING:** To prevent fire hazards during prolonged inactivity, disconnect the battery if the machine will not be used for over a month. Ensure the battery is charged before storage.

**Operating on Slopes:**
**DANGER:** Slow down when changing direction on slopes to maintain control.

**Transporting the Machine:**
**WARNING:** Properly secure the machine during transport, and ensure that it is appropriate for the vehicle type being used.

**Achieving Optimal Cutting Quality:**
Maintain sharp blades to reduce plant stress and promote healthy growth. Adjust cutting heights as necessary and ensure a clean cut, free from brown edges.

**Maintenance Guidelines:**
**WARNING:** Always disconnect power before beginning maintenance or repairs. Use appropriate personal protective equipment and follow instructions for your specific model.

**Routine Maintenance:**
Follow standard operating procedures and lubrication schedules as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.

**Care of Engine and Components:**
Refer to specific instructions for engine maintenance to ensure that components function optimally. Regular checks are recommended for long-term performance.

**Battery Maintenance:**
Ensure connections are secure and follow charging instructions to maintain battery health. Always use manufacturer-approved chargers and components for replacements. Consult instructions for any repairs or adjustments necessary for optimal performance.

### Maintenance Guidelines

**Cutting Deck Alignment**

To ensure proper cutting, the front of the deck should be positioned higher than the rear. Adjust the deck so that it is level; make sure that the deck is resting correctly. If necessary, adjust the height. For optimal performance, consult a licensed service provider to check the engagement and brake of the blade, as this can usually be performed in a matter of seconds.

---

**Rake Adjustment**

Ensure the rake is engaged. If it isn't, and you can access the cover, check the rake's position. WARNING: If the adjustment is not successful, contact a licensed service provider. Do not perform any additional work on the brake beyond what is outlined here.

---

**Drive Belt Tension Adjustment**

Ensure the system is disengaged before proceeding. The drive belt should meet the specified tension requirements. If the tension is too tight or too loose, make the appropriate adjustments as needed.
