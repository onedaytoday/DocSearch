**Counters Overview**

The counters are strategically positioned below, designed with AISI materials of the highest standard. There are three types of counters, each featuring built-in sections capable of maintaining temperatures between 2°C and +10°C, with an operating height tolerance up to 43°C. 

**Installation and Maintenance**

The counters are easy to install and clean, featuring rounded corners for convenience. They are mounted to facilitate straightforward cleaning access. User-friendly design elements ensure efficient operation in the 2°C to +10°C range, enhanced by forced cooling mechanisms and AISI material thickness. Front access simplifies maintenance.

**Environmental Considerations**

Constructed with environmentally friendly insulation materials (CFC and HCFC-free, cyclopenthane), the counters adhere to ISO standards, emphasizing sustainable practices.
