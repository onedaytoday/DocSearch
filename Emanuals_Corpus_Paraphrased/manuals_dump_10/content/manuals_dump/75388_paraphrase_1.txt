**First-Time Use**  
Before heating, ensure that the appliance is empty. Turn the thermostat to MAX and allow it to reach the desired temperature, which should take approximately a few minutes. This process may need to be repeated for optimal cooking results.

**Thermostat Operation**  
Set the thermostat by turning it clockwise to achieve temperatures between 50°C and 230°C (MAX). The thermostat light will indicate when the set temperature has been reached. If the thermostat malfunctions or shows signs of overheating, disconnect the power supply immediately and seek professional assistance.

Allow the appliance to cool down naturally. The automatic shut-off feature will activate under certain conditions, such as overheating. Ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power source before performing any cleaning.

**Functionality**  
The various cooking functions allow for flexibility in meal preparation. The Countdown function can be set by pressing the designated button, which will activate a timer for the cooking duration. Note that the appliance will remain operational until the Countdown timer expires, signaled by an acoustic alert.

**Cooking Guidelines**  
Utilize the proper cookware to ensure safe and effective heating. Different materials affect cooking times and outcomes. Use heat-resistant items and be careful of heat buildup during cooking. The heating mechanism circulates air around food items to achieve even cooking. 

**Final Notes**  
When using advanced features, such as the thermal cooking function or the defrosting settings, adjust the thermostat as necessary. Cooking times may vary based on the type of food and the thickness of materials used. Ensure the appliance is used as indicated to achieve the best results.

When cooking dough and cake, achieving the right consistency is essential, as it affects cooking time. The dough should be prepared according to the specific requirements for various types of cakes. For optimal results, meat should be cooked at minimum temperatures of 200°C-230°C to avoid overcooking, especially for red meat. In contrast, white meat is best cooked at lower temperatures of 150°C-175°C. It’s important to turn the meat during cooking to ensure even heating, especially when utilizing multiple shelves in the oven.

The type of food being cooked dictates the cooking method and temperature, which should be monitored using appropriate charts. Pre-heating the oven is a critical step in this process.

For specific dishes, such as cakes, bread, pizza, and meat, temperatures and cooking times should be adjusted accordingly. Cleaning the oven requires caution to prevent fire hazards and to avoid the use of unsuitable cleaning agents. Internal and external cleaning should be done with non-abrasive cloths and recommended cleaners while ensuring that the oven is unplugged.

If the light bulb needs replacing, adhere to the specifications provided. Any issues with the light or cooking temperatures should be addressed by checking the setting and connections. If errors persist, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact customer service for further assistance.

For safety and compliance, ensure that the oven is properly earthed and that its installation adheres to the prescribed guidelines. The surrounding area should be adequate to prevent overheating, and any service maintenance should be conducted by certified personnel.

For further support, customers may contact the service center as outlined in the warranty details, ensuring that all queries are addressed within the specified terms and conditions.
