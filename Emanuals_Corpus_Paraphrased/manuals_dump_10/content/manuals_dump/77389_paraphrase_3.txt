- **Date (M/D/Y):**  

It's essential to ensure that the supply and grounding are properly wired to all types of switches so that they can effectively control the system. Both the suction and discharge lines must be connected and functional.

For downstream components, it's advisable to position them correctly per ASME standards. Specifically, for the cooled coolers, these should be connected to the front head. Recommendations for successful installation of VSG/VSSG systems, including item numbers 35391SSG, must be followed to maintain warranty coverage.

**Section**

Connections to cooled coolers must comply with the prescribed flow paths. Ensure that the units are correctly wired to support the anticipated operational rotation, as indicated by design specifications. Both the upstream and downstream components should be checked to verify their alignment and functionality. Follow the guidelines for mixing operations, particularly for opening and closing mechanisms. The assembly should be tested and purged as necessary to ensure proper performance without service interruptions.

For VSG/VSSG installation and operation, compliance with the specified protocols is critical to avoid issues. The Compact PLC should be installed according to the detailed chart, which includes warning information regarding gas types and possible hazards (e.g., LFG, NG). Proper safety equipment should be utilized during setup to prevent severe injuries.

**Section Operation**

The operation of the VSG/VSSG systems via the Compact PLC involves careful monitoring and adherence to guidelines. Operators should ensure that all necessary controls are inspected beforehand. If there is a discrepancy in performance (like flow rates), immediate troubleshooting according to the outlined steps should be done to prevent failures.

To ensure a smooth transition from one operational mode to another, sections related to the on/off switch and the assembly's mechanical components must be correctly isolated to facilitate device maintenance. 

**Section Assembly**

During assembly, all components, especially the control board, should be checked for correct installation. Proper vibration control should also be verified. The assembly precautions include ensuring that wires are appropriately secured and that safety checklists are completed.

For setup confirmation, visual indications from the LED should be monitored closely during the powering process. Operators will need to initiate commands for rotation adjustments, ensuring that the actuator receives the correct signal. 

**Section VSSG**

For command rotation, the motors must be engaged in the proper direction (CW or CCW). This should correspond to the command parameters set within the system controls. Changes in torque need to be monitored closely to maintain optimal operating efficiency.

Operators should be careful while manipulating the physical components to avoid mechanical stops and potential damage. Special attention to hydraulic and electrical interfaces is warranted, and visual confirmation of output levels must be logged accurately.

**Section Mixing Operation**

In the mixing operation phase, appropriate procedures must be followed to ensure that fluids are mixed at the right temperatures. When the PLC indicates that conditions are favorable, flow adjustments should be made. The manual override must function smoothly and allow for transitions between closed and open positions based on system requirements. 

The operational flow must meet specific temperature criteria to avoid system inefficiencies or failures. Regular monitoring and adherence to operational standards are essential for maintaining system integrity.

### Troubleshooting

**Section: Common Issues**  
The system may produce a clicking sound when operating intermittently or overheating, often due to a malfunctioning thermal switch. Ensure the gearmotor operates correctly and that the thermal switch is functioning as expected. Indicators of overheating or a blown relay may point to these issues. Check the photochopper and optocouplers for faults, as a stripped screw or poor connections may lead to further malfunction. The EEPROM memory may also have a role if issues persist.

**Section: LED Indications**  
Internal LED indicators often display statuses, where "* = ON" and "_ = OFF." If optocouplers are failing, they may need replacement. To test the optocouplers, manually trigger the photochopper using DC power to observe responses at TP1 and TP2 on the board. If optocouplers are not functioning, recalibration may be necessary, especially if they are exposed to excess light or during service without covers.

**Section: Thermal Switch Testing**  
The TS1 thermal switch should be easily located on the board. If overheating occurs, the thermal switch should be tested under DC conditions. If it remains closed, this could affect the operation of the 24V supply, potentially triggering an error display. Proper functionality of the EEPROM may be compromised if the 24V conditions are inconsistent or faulty.

**Section: Suction and Operation Ratios**  
When issues arise with suction levels, troubleshoot by reviewing system settings against recommended operating ratios. Isolation values should align with the cooler's specifications. If ratios are improperly set, it could complicate suction performance, leading to operational inefficiencies.

**Section: High Injection Capacity Symptoms**  
If the system produces high suction levels leading to operational failures, double-check cooler specifications and the type of variable frequency drives (VFD) being used. Ensuring correct assembly and compatibility is crucial for optimal functioning.

**Section: High Amperage and PLC Interactions**  
Monitor the system for any backspin conditions that might necessitate shutdowns. Incorrect mounting or suction issues could impede operations and must be systematically reviewed.
