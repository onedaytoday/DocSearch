The unit is designed for easy installation, fitting standard mounting locations while housing the collection sections. Electrical connections are clearly defined for safety. Ensure wires are properly organized and connected to avoid malfunction.

**Installation Guidelines**

Recognize the importance of selecting the correct installation location that aligns with the forced-air system. Ensure a clearance of at least a few inches around the unit for efficient air circulation and servicing access.

**Duct Configuration**

The air cleaner will typically be shipped with the air flow oriented from left to right. If alternative flow direction is needed, modifications can be made, provided the necessary adjustments to wiring and ductwork are executed.

**Wiring Instructions**

All electrical connections must adhere to safety guidelines to prevent hazards. Ensure the unit is powered off before handling wires. Check for proper grounding and follow the schematic provided for accurate wiring.

**Operation Monitoring**

With the power restored, use the ON-OFF switch to activate the air cleaner. A light indicator will signal proper function. If issues arise, troubleshoot based on provided guidelines, which detail possible malfunctions.
