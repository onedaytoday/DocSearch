### COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC Functions

The **COOLMATIC** function activates cooling by pressing the COOLMATIC button. The yellow indicator light confirms that the COOLMATIC mode is engaged. This feature maintains the desired temperature for a set number of hours. You can activate or deactivate the COOLMATIC function manually, and the display shows the current temperature.

Similarly, the **FROSTMATIC** function is designed to rapidly freeze fresh food, preserving previously frozen items. To engage FROSTMATIC, press the corresponding button; the yellow light indicates that this mode is active. This feature can also be switched off manually after a specified number of hours.

### Appliance Operation

To turn the appliance on or off, press and hold both the ON/OFF buttons for several seconds. A countdown occurs before the appliance powers down. Note that if there is a power interruption or closure of doors, the appliance will resume its previous operation when power restores.

For safety, regularly check the food storage for proper sealing. Cover items to avoid contamination and maintain hygiene. Use correct shelf heights for optimal cooling—placing particularly chill-sensitive items in the lower sections.

### Monitoring Temperatures and Warnings

Temperature warnings will activate if internal conditions exceed specified limits. The appliance emits an acoustic alert if the temperature of any food rises above safe levels or if the compartment door remains open. You can acknowledge this alarm by pressing the WARNING OFF button.

When the temperature returns to normal, the warning indicators will turn off automatically. If the cooling conditions fail to stabilize, consult technical support for rectification.

### Accessories and Storage Guidelines

Ensure items are appropriately positioned on the shelves. Bottles should stand upright and can be relocated without difficulty. Always maintain adequate spacing between items to permit airflow and efficient cooling.

For best results, verify the internal temperature using a thermometer. After loading, check that the stored food remains at or below the recommended temperature levels.

### Defrosting

To maintain the unit’s efficiency, defrost it regularly—ideally once a year or when frost accumulation exceeds a defined thickness. Follow manufacturer guidelines for defrosting procedures by disconnecting power and managing food storage accordingly.

### Sounds During Operation

Normal operational sounds include a gentle whir as the compressor runs. If you notice unusual noises or overheating, verify that the appliance is properly ventilated and not overloaded. Adjust food placement if blockage occurs.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

For effective cleaning, disconnect the unit from the power supply beforehand. Use non-corrosive cleaning products to avoid damaging the appliance. Do not cover vents or parts that facilitate cooling.

When replacing the internal lightbulb, ensure you switch off the appliance and follow proper safety measures. 

### Troubleshooting

If complications arise during operation, refer to the troubleshooting section. Any persistent issues beyond basic fixes should be addressed by qualified service personnel. Always consult guidelines for safety and operational integrity before beginning repairs.

**Functionality Overview**

The lighting of the AEG appliance turns off automatically during operation. If water collects or frost forms on the shelves, normal sounds may be heard. In cases of mechanical malfunction or breakdown, please consult AEG Service Force. It is important to adhere to relevant purchase service regulations and comply with applicable legislation, including the General Safety Directive (GSG), the Equipment and Product Safety Regulation (VBG), and standards from the German Institution for Standardization (VDE), in conjunction with EU directives, such as 73/23/EWG and 89/336/EWG.

**Technical Considerations**

The refrigerator's cooling system draws warmth away from food items, keeping them chilled. This process involves heat exchange, where warmth is expelled to the surrounding environment. The cooling components are typically found at the rear of the appliance.
