### ZKR1516, ZKR1506, ZKR1526 - Technical Overview

**Introduction**
This document provides essential information and guidelines on the operational features and safety precautions necessary for the proper use of these appliances. Strict adherence to these instructions is crucial to ensure safe operation and to protect individuals, particularly children and those with limited physical ability or knowledge.

**Child Safety**
To prevent risk, keep children away from the appliance, as improper use can lead to potential hazards such as suffocation or electric shock. Ensure that any safety mechanisms, such as latches, are functioning correctly to avoid accidents.

**Warnings**
Always heed warnings related to overheating, potential electrical short circuits, or fire hazards. Avoid blocking ventilation openings and refrain from using the appliance near sources of heat or fire. Regularly inspect the appliance for any signs of damage.

**Installation**
The appliance must be installed correctly, as improper placement could cause overheating or fire hazards. Allow the unit to stand upright for at least four hours after transportation before plugging it in. Follow installation guidelines closely to ensure safety and optimal performance.

**Cooling Performance**
The appliance’s cooling efficiency can be influenced by its content and ambient temperature. It is vital to set the appropriate temperature for various types of food and to avoid overloading the shelves to maintain an optimal cooling environment.

**Cleaning Guidelines**
Routine cleaning is essential for optimal performance. Use suitable cleaning agents and avoid exposing sensitive components to moisture. Defrost the appliance when frost buildup reaches approximately 1 cm in thickness to prevent reduced efficiency.

**Troubleshooting**
In case of any operational issues, double-check electrical connections and the appliance’s placement. Ensure that the doors seal correctly and the cooling units are not obstructed by other items. If problems persist, consult the technical service or authorized repair personnel for assistance.

**Technical Specifications**
Refer to the appliance's rating plate for specific operating conditions, including temperature ranges. The unit should operate efficiently within the specified temperature ranges for optimal performance.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a safe and effective use of the ZKR1516, ZKR1506, and ZKR1526 appliances.

This document outlines the proper installation and operational guidelines for the heating system. To optimize performance, ensure the heat source—such as boilers or sunlight—is unobstructed from above and behind. Ideally, the unit should be positioned at least a certain distance from these heat sources. For optimal shelf reversibility, follow the operational instructions carefully, as each task may require confirmation from a different manufacturer.

**Important Notice:** Ensure the power supply is correctly connected to avoid hazards. The unit can be easily adjusted or modified; however, proper care must be taken during this process.

To adjust the unit, unscrew the screws indicated by the arrow. Make sure all screws are tightly secured. If adjustments are necessary, unscrew the top screws and follow the directional indicators to reposition as needed. After repositioning, allow the unit to settle for a minimum of four hours before use to ensure stability.

The unit’s reversibility features and supply ratings must be adhered to, with careful attention paid to ensuring the power supply is properly earthed. For units that are not correctly earthed, consult the manual or a qualified technician to treat it as a standard household device while compliant with E.E.C. Directives.

Please recycle responsibly and consult local resources for information on proper disposal. The responsibility for compliance and safety lies with the user. For more details on recycling or service information, refer to the point of purchase or customer service.
