**Baking and Cooking Functions Overview**

For optimal results, use the BAKING, FAN COOKING, or CONVENTIONAL settings. Position your cooking sheets according to the instructions provided. Note that when using the BAKING or CONVENTIONAL functions, the shelf should be selected from the top down for even baking of cakes. Preheating is essential, especially for CONVENTIONAL cooking, and this can slightly enhance cooking performance. 

When using the BAKING or CONVENTIONAL functions, ensure that cooking items such as cakes or bread are adjusted for proper height to guarantee thorough cooking. If smoke or burning occurs, decrease the cooking temperature and monitor closely.

**Specific Cooking Instructions**

For various types of cake, including apple cake and Christmas cake, preheat using the appropriate function and select the correct shelf position. Roasting meats can be effectively done with FAN COOKING, ROTITHERM, or CONVENTIONAL settings; make sure to choose a heat-resistant roasting sheet and track the cooking process to prevent burning.

Poultry and meatloaf can also be baked using these multiple settings. Ensure that you are using the right shelf height for even cooking, selecting from the highest available positions where appropriate. 

**Roasting and Cooking Notes**

When roasting, it may be advisable to switch off the heating just before completion to prevent overcooking. Follow shelf guidelines for different meats, adjusting for their thickness accordingly to ensure proper cooking without burning. 

**Defrosting and Drying Functions**

For defrosting, utilize the DEFROST function, ensuring to cover the food adequately. When drying, the FAN COOKING function should be accompanied by grease-proof sheets. 

**Preservation and Cleaning Guidelines**

For preserving items like fruits and vegetables, use the BOTTOM HEAT function, ensuring containers are sealed properly. For cleaning appliances, employ the PYROLUXE cleaning function, following safety protocols and ensuring the appliance is switched off before maintenance tasks.
