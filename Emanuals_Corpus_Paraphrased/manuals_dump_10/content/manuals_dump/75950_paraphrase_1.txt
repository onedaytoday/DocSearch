**Installation Guidelines**
The appliance must be placed in a well-ventilated area. Ensure there is sufficient clearance at the back and top to allow for proper heat dissipation.

**Control Overview**
The appliance features ON/OFF and stand-by indicators, along with the COOLMATIC function. Use the (WARMER) and (COLDER) buttons to adjust the desired temperature. The current and desired temperatures are displayed digitally, with the actual temperature flashing until it stabilizes.

**COOLMATIC Functionality**
The COOLMATIC feature is designed for rapid cooling of food. When activated, the COOLMATIC indicator light will illuminate. The functionality can cool multiple items efficiently and is particularly effective for room-temperature goods. Once the desired temperature is attained, the appliance will automatically switch back to standard operation.

### Warning

If the temperature rises beyond a set point, an acoustic warning tone will sound. To rearrange food items, disable the warning tone using the "ALARM OFF" button. The warning will deactivate when the door is closed. If the warning light flashes and the tone sounds, it may indicate that the internal temperature exceeds a specified threshold. 

To turn off the appliance, use the ON/OFF switch and confirm that the countdown completes before turning off. Disconnecting the appliance from the power supply ensures it is entirely powered down. 

Keeping the appliance closed is crucial; accidental openings may lead to temperature fluctuations and potential mold growth. Ensure to regularly empty and clean the appliance. Adjust items using the (WARMER) or (COLDER) settings as required. Ensure that the desired temperature is reached, with special attention to areas where food tends to spoil more quickly, such as meat and dairy products.

To optimize cooling performance, arrange shelves appropriately for airflow. Familiarize yourself with the thermometer to monitor temperatures, especially overnight to assess whether it maintains adequate cooling levels.

### Normal Sounds
