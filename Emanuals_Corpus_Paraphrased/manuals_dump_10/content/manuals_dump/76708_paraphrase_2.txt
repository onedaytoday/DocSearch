**WhiteBoardScreen Installation Instructions**

To proceed with the installation of the WhiteBoardScreen, ensure that you are using the appropriate screws as specified for wall mounting. Mount the top of the WhiteBoardScreen to the designated wall position, securing it with wall screws or anchors, depending on the wall type. Follow the exact specifications for screw placement and use the correct brackets for sizes 60 inches, 80 inches, or 96 inches as indicated for optimal support.

**Overhead Installation Guidelines**

For mounting the StarBright4 WhiteBoardScreen, which features high reflectivity, follow the recommended installation height for achieving the best brightness and functionality. Refer to the charts below for specific dimensions involved in the installation process, which include height measurements (A, B, C, D, E), and any necessary relationships between these measurements to ensure proper alignment for projection.

Each screen model (WB60V, WB80V, WB96H) has its own specific height and projection requirements to maximize visual performance.
