**Washing Instructions Overview**

For optimal washing, follow the specified type and temperature settings as indicated. Utilize a high wash temperature up to 60°C for synthetic materials (Easy-care fabrics) such as nightgowns, pajamas, tablecloths, work covers, tea shirts, and pillowcases. Delicate items require specific attention to their washing methods. Woolens and bathrobes should be washed only under appropriate conditions.

**Laundry Products**

When using bleach, select the right type suitable for both whites and colored fabrics. For stain removal, products like VANISH In-Wash and GloWhite are effective against tougher stains; simply add them to your detergent. Use fabric conditioners specifically designed for delicate items to minimize wear and tear.

**Washing Machine Settings**

Familiarize yourself with various machine settings including EXTRA RINSE, RINSE HOLD, STAIN, PREWASH, or QUICK WASH options to match the fabric type being cleaned. Indicator lights will guide you through the selected phases such as RINSE, WASH, SPIN, and SOAK.

**Starting and Resetting the Machine**

To initiate a wash cycle, press the START/PAUSE button; indicator lights will flash throughout the process. If the RINSE HOLD option is selected, the relevant light will indicate its status. For DELAY START, the countdown will display once selected.

**Economic Settings**

Utilize the ECONOMY mode instead of the 95°C setting for normal whites, ideally around 67°C. Monitor the phase indicators to ensure proper washing for synthetic fabrics, allowing short cycles for efficiency.

**Conclusion**

Adhere to the recommended instructions for washing various fabrics to maintain the appearance and longevity of garments and household items. Use the appropriate additives and adjust settings per fabric requirements for optimal results.

This revision reduces redundancy and presents the information in a clearer, more concise manner while retaining the original meaning.

**Economy Mode**: Choose the "E" setting instead of "95C" for regular whites; opt for "67C" for synthetic fabrics. Adjust the cycle to "60C" for the phase indicated. Incoming quantities for short synthetic loads is optimal with the following settings: Spin Speed, Stain, Quick Prewash, Extra Rinse, Rinse Hold, and specific options for wool and colored ease. Wash colored shirts and towels at "40C". To start or pause the machine, use the START/PAUSE button.

Ensure proper cleaning and maintenance: clean the top of the recess with specific tools as needed. If there's water accumulation or a clog in the hose, turn off the water supply, disconnect the hose, and clean as required. Reattach the hose properly. If there is an error indicating a malfunction (e.g., E00, E10, E20), follow the troubleshooting steps provided and utilize the Emergency empty feature if the hose becomes clogged.

Always ensure all connections are secure and the hoses are properly installed to avoid leaks. If issues persist, contact the AEG Service Force for assistance.

For efficient washing, use the correct additives and maintain the machine per the manual’s specifications. If you encounter unresolved problems, please refer to the troubleshooting guide thoroughly and follow the steps for correct operation.
