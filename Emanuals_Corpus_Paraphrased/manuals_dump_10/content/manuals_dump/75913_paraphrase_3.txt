## OPERATING AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR ELECTROLUX REFRIGERATORS TYPE A310 MODEL RM 123E (Bottled and Operation) MODEL RM 122F (Bottled and Operation)

### IMPORTANT USER INFORMATION

It is essential to keep these instructions for future reference. If the unit is transferred to another owner, ensure that these instructions accompany it, containing crucial information regarding its operation and maintenance. Users or technicians should consult the manual before operating the appliance. Children should not be allowed to interact with the device or its components, and repairs should only be performed by authorized service personnel. This appliance must be used according to its specifications and guidelines, designed to supply heat and maintain food storage. Follow the instructions regarding the clearance at the back, ensuring air circulation for optimal functioning during defrosting or cleaning. 

**Safety Note:** Do not attempt to remove frost with sharp tools; ice should defrost naturally according to the provided guidance. Upon installation, allow the unit to stabilize before using it, particularly for absorption-type models. Exercise care with heavy loads, as food items may cause burns to skin. Always adhere strictly to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

### GENERAL GUIDE TO FITTING ANY PLUG

When fitting a plug, ensure correct alignment with the appropriate terminals, avoiding contact with the outer sheath or insulation surrounding the conductors. Secure the cover properly with screws. 

### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

**INTRODUCTION**

Before installation, carefully review these instructions, keeping in mind the necessary heat dissipation from the cooling section at the back of the appliance. Ensure that clearances are maintained to prevent impaired cooling performance. The unit operates effectively in ambient temperatures between 2°C (36°F) and 35°C (95°F).

Consult with a qualified technician if unclear about positioning concerning regulations and practices for existing installations. The shelves and compartments are designed to house food effectively.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE:**

Ensure that all motorized connections are properly made to prevent mishaps associated with bottled-gas applications. Refer to relevant safety specifications provided by authorities such as the British Water Authorities and the National Federation.

### VENTILATION

Proper ventilation is crucial for efficient cooling. Confirm that the cooling system and heat dissipation openings are not obstructed to maintain optimal unit performance.

### IMPORTANCE OF LEVELING

The refrigerator must be positioned level to ensure effective cooling. Ice trays should be aligned appropriately for the best performance within the unit.

### CHANGING DOOR HINGES TO OPPOSITE SIDE

When changing the door hinges, carefully detach the door and its components, then reinstall them on the opposite side following the outlined steps to ensure secure fitting.

### CHANGING OUTER DOOR PANEL

If replacing the outer door panel, carefully detach the existing panel and install the new one, ensuring it matches the unit's dimensions and design specifications.

### DIMENSIONS OF REFRIGERATOR

Ensure adequate space is allocated in the installation area to allow for proper function and ventilation of the unit.

### BUILDING-IN

While integrating the refrigerator, ensure that sufficient ventilation exists at the back for optimal cooling performance.

### VENT HOLE UNDER REFRIGERATOR

The vent hole should be effectively positioned to prevent overheating. Check that flue arrangements are correctly installed to facilitate airflow.

### ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION

For RM 123 models, ensure that the electrical connections are secure, including the 75W, 230V supply and 12V connections. Verify that wiring complies with IEE regulations and relevant safety standards. Proper polarity is crucial for battery connections.

Always follow the prescribed cross-sectional area for wiring to ensure safe and effective operation.

Here's a paraphrased version of your text:

---

Ensure the appliance is connected to a properly earthed 230V electricity supply. The outlet must be conveniently accessible for the plug. In the UK, wire color coding is as follows: **Green-Yellow = Earth**, **Blue = Neutral**, and **Brown = Live**. Ensure connections align appropriately with the corresponding terminals.

**IMPORTANT**: This appliance must be earthed. If using a BS fused plug, ensure it's compatible with the electrical standards of your country. The appliance may require a 12V supply for operations, particularly for heating mechanisms, so proper connections to the back of the unit are crucial. Allow adequate space for servicing, and use appropriately sized wires with adequate cross-sectional areas.

Ensure polarity is correct when connecting the wiring, maintaining proper organization for the switch. The appliance should disconnect readily from the 12V supply during operation, as it will streamline performance and prevent overheating.

Regarding gas connections, use permanently operating systems suitable for bottled gas. Follow local regulations, ensuring the gas supply is threaded correctly and securely sealed. Regular access for servicing should be accommodated by a properly placed stopcock.

**WARNING**: Avoid using an open flame for any purpose. Follow operational instructions closely to ensure proper function. Shifts in condition or failure to adhere to guidelines may affect performance. Maintain unobstructed airflow for cooling and monitor for obstructions during vehicle motion.

If the cooling system appears to malfunction during stationary use or while in transit, address promptly to prevent overheating. Operations with the ice tray should allow for proper placement without blockage from other items. 

In the event that the gas supply is interrupted or needs to be restarted, follow described lighting procedures closely. Ensure appropriate batteries and connections are used for electrical operation. Switch off and isolate all connections to ensure safety.

Observe the temperature regulation method, adjusting based on contents and environmental conditions to maintain optimal cooling performance. For effective food storage, utilize shelves sensibly and ensure items are covered.

Finally, employ a travel catch to secure the unit during transport, preventing any unintended openings.

**DEFROSTING and Ice Tray Shelf Maintenance:** To maintain optimal performance, the ice tray should be defrosted regularly—typically once every few weeks or as needed based on frost buildup. Turn off the refrigerator and remove the ice tray. Clean out any frost, ensuring both the tray and shelf are free of ice. Restore power to the appliance and refill the ice tray with fresh water, applying heat as required to expedite the defrosting process.

**CLEANING Guidelines:** Clean the refrigerator thoroughly as necessary. Disconnect the power source before cleaning the interior and exterior surfaces with a damp cloth. Finally, wipe down with a dry cloth to ensure no moisture remains. Avoid strong chemicals, abrasives, or heavily scented cleaning products on any part of the refrigerator.

**USAGE REMINDERS:** When not in use, disconnect the refrigerator from the power supply or 12V system. Empty the contents and clean it thoroughly to prevent any issues. 

**TROUBLESHOOTING:** If the refrigerator fails to operate, follow these checks: 
- Ensure the "STARTING THE REFRIGERATOR" instructions were adhered to.
- Verify that the bottle is empty.
- Check that the 12V supply is properly connected and intact.
- Ensure the 12V switch is operational.
- If using 230V, confirm the supply is connected and intact, and that the thermostat is set to 'off' to avoid further issues.

**MAINTENANCE:** Inspect hoses and couplings for cracks or wear. If issues arise, consult a service technician for further assistance.

**USEFUL TIPS:** Ensure the refrigerator operates on 12V while the vehicle is in motion to prevent battery drain. Keep it clean and organized while in use, storing food items properly to avoid condensation issues.

**SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS:** For any service needs or replacement parts, please refer to local service providers or the telephone directory.
