### Software Chapter: Advanced Exporting to PSP

This section covers the process of exporting footage to PSP (PlayStation Portable). Ensure that the footage is adjusted to the correct aspect ratio. Start by selecting the recording, then choose the PSP method, noting that the file should be saved as something like M4V50970.MP4. Remember that the PSP can handle .M4V and .MP4 files, but cannot read other formats with the corresponding .THM files.

To begin, connect the PSP via USB. Access the interface, and look for the option to mount the memory. The memory should appear as "Untitled" in the MP_ROOT directory. Inside the MP_ROOT folder, you should find a subfolder named 100MNV01 where the .MP4 files and their associated .THM files should be placed. 

Once you’ve finished transferring, unmount the Memory Stick before highlighting the recording for playback. Utilize the USB buttons on the PSP to navigate to the correct section and choose the thumbnail for playback.

### Software Chapter: Advanced Exporting to Other Formats

This chapter outlines how to export recorded footage in various formats. Highlight the recording and select "Export," then choose the desired output format, ideally MPEG-4 or H.264 (recommended). H.264 is usually superior for quality; however, MPEG-4 may be suitable for other uses. Depending on the file, you can choose either MPEG Stream formats (MPEG-1 or MPEG-2) or AVI for archival purposes.

### Software Chapter: Archiving Recordings

This chapter provides details on archiving recordings along with relevant metadata. The archive process allows you to store and recreate recordings wherever necessary.
