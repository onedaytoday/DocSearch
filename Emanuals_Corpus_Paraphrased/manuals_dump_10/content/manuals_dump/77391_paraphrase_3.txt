### PREPARATIONS
- Tools: Use a hand or power drill with an appropriate drill bit if necessary.
- Ensure safe handling to avoid electric shock during installation. 

**Thermostat Overview:**  
The heat/cool thermostat consists of three primary sections: a cover, a base, and a switching mechanism that activates or deactivates power. 

When detaching the thermostat from the wall, handle it carefully to prevent the wires from falling back into the wall cavity. Use a flat blade screwdriver, spirit level, or plumb bob as needed for installation.

### IMPORTANT WARNINGS
- HAZARD WARNING: The thermostat may contain mercury. In case of breakage, it is crucial to handle the mercury safely, as it can pose health risks if mishandled.

### MOUNTING AND WIRING:
- When connecting the new thermostat, refer to the wiring diagrams specific to heat/cool systems.
- Ensure all connections are secure to prevent faulty operation.
- Check compatibility with existing wiring systems.

### CHECKING THERMOSTAT OPERATION:
1. Set the system switch to "ON" and observe if the blower responds.
2. Change the settings between "HEAT" and "COOL" to check their operational status. The indicators should display the current settings.

**Configuration Options:**
- Set temperature preferences using the buttons on the thermostat.
- Adjust Celsius/Fahrenheit display settings as needed.
- Access the configuration menu for advanced settings.

### TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
- If the system does not operate correctly, double-check all wire connections and settings.
- Refer to the troubleshooting chart for common symptoms and their corrective actions.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

**Symptom:** 

**Corrective Action:**
1. Set the mode to "Cool." Ensure the thermostat is switched to "Cool" and verify that all wires are securely connected.
2. If the thermostat consistently clicks between Heat, Cool, or "Constantly On," check if the wires are shorted or touching each other.
3. If the system operates correctly, ensure the thermostat is functioning well. 
4. If the thermostat seems improperly located or if there are multiple thermostats, this could affect heating and cooling performance.
5. To improve system efficiency, consider adjusting the thermostat's position as per operational guidelines.
6. If the thermostat is malfunctioning, or if service is required, refer to the technical documentation or visit www.white-rodgers.com for assistance. 

Make adjustments to heating and cooling as needed to optimize the service.
