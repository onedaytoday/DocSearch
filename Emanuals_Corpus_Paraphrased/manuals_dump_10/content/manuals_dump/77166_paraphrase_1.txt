### Installation and Uninstallation Instructions  

To uninstall, navigate to the Control Panel, select "Programs and Features," then locate and select the Touch application. If you prefer single-touch functionality, modify the `EloOptions.ini` file to enable the one-touch setting.  

The installation procedure allows users to calibrate Touch and access advanced properties through Touch Services. You can fine-tune the Touch settings via the relevant directory.  

**Cursor Edge Adjustment (CEA):**  
This feature helps to enhance the touch sensitivity by calibrating points that might otherwise be ignored. Users can increase or decrease the CEA through the provided controls. 

To disable CEA, ensure your Touch service is calibrated correctly before applying changes. If calibration is completed, the user can adjust preferences accordingly.
