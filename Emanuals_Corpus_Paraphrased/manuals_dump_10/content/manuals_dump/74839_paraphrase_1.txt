#### Safety and Usage Guidelines

Installation and initial operation must comply with all relevant electricity supply codes and standards, as governed by ANSI Z223.1/NFPA and CSA B149. Ensure all power supplies are disconnected before maintenance or inspection. Operators should review these instructions and confirm compliance with operational guidelines at least annually.

#### Operational Safety

Maintain a focus on safety. Hot surfaces can lead to burns, and contact with hot oil or food may cause severe injuries. Ensure that equipment is mounted securely and that safety measures are in place to prevent accidents.

### Technical Data and After-Sales Support

Ensure that the appliance is powered off and disconnected for any repairs, which should only be done by authorized personnel. Regular maintenance and servicing are recommended, especially in regard to ignition systems.

### Installation Instructions

- **Installation Requirements:** Ensure appliances are correctly positioned, allowing for proper ventilation and compliance with regulatory standards.
- **Height Adjustment:** Adjust the appliance using the adjustable legs to maintain a proper and safe operational height.
- **Assembly Instructions for Multiple Appliances:** Follow guidelines for secure assembly and positioning, ensuring all screws and mounts are properly fastened.

### Gas Connection

The gas connection should only be performed by qualified technicians. Verify compatibility with existing gas supply and ensure all connections comply with safety regulations. 

### Operating Instructions

#### General Operation

The appliance features a thermostat and various operational settings for optimal performance. 

#### Ignition Procedures

To ignite the pilot burner, press the button, turning it clockwise for a designated time until the flame is established. The main burner can be ignited by turning its control knob to the desired setting.

### Deep Frying Procedures

Monitor frying temperatures, maintaining a range of 300째F (150째C) to 350째F (180째C) for best results. Adjust food quantities as necessary to ensure consistent cooking performance.

By following these guidelines methodically, safe and effective operation can be achieved.

### Turning Off the Main Burner

To switch off the oven's main burner, turn the back knob clockwise from the highest setting to the off position. This will extinguish the flame. For the pilot burner, press it lightly and rotate it clockwise to turn off the gas supply and extinguish the flame. Ensure that you only perform this step when the heating elements have cooled down. 

### Oil Care

After the fryer has cooled down, switch the valve to the closed position. Disconnect the oil collection container from the valve and clean both thoroughly. Remove any accumulated oil and debris from the trough and reattach the cover securely. 

### Changing the Frying Oil

When the oil becomes dirty, follow this procedure: First, switch off the appliance and allow the trough to cool. Then, open the valve and drain the used oil into a collection container without spilling. 

### Cleaning

Always allow the fryer to cool before any cleaning operation. Turn off the burner and valve, then clean the trough with a suitable cleaning solution, ensuring to dry it thoroughly with a clean cloth. Use regular cleaning methods for the exterior without high-pressure cleaners. 

### Troubleshooting

If a malfunction occurs, such as the temperature being excessive or the flame turning yellow, inspect the gas burner for cleanliness and the thermostat for proper operation. Inform the service department if necessary. 

### General Operating Instructions

Follow all safety and operating procedures outlined in the service manual. Ensure the installation meets local codes and standards, including ANSI Z223.1/NFPA and CSA regulations. Regular maintenance is essential for safe operation. 

### Gas Connection Instructions

For gas connections, ensure all fittings meet NPT standards and that the pressure corresponds to those specified in the guidelines. 

### General Operation

The fryer should have a thermostat (STB) for temperature control. Ensure the ignition system functions correctly, and monitor the burner settings constantly for optimal operation. 

Regularly inspect the fryer to prevent issues and maintain safety standards throughout its use.
