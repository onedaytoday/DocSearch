Here's a technical paraphrase of your text:

To achieve optimal cooking results for meat, it is essential to utilize high heat, which can be set between 300°F and 550°F, ideally reaching up to 550°F for broiling. Preheating the broiler ensures proper browning. Season the food and manage the cooking process by regularly turning or repositioning it. The intense heat allows grease to render; however, monitor it closely to avoid flare-ups, as the grease can ignite. If a fire occurs, do not throw water on it—use a fire extinguisher instead. 

For effective roasting using convection, you can set the temperature within the range of 170°F to 550°F, with a common setting at 350°F. Preheating is recommended, and it can reduce cooking time for already prepped food. When utilizing the convection feature, adjustments in cooking times and temperatures might be required based on the food type.

When using convection roasting specifically for meats and poultry, ensure that the food is securely positioned on the rack, allowing hot air to circulate adequately for even cooking and browning. It’s crucial to monitor the grease to prevent fires and avoid covering the food tightly during cooking. 

For all cooking modes, the oven will indicate preheating status, and various options—such as KEEP WARM or COOK TIME—allow for flexible cooking management. It is important to monitor internal temperatures with a food thermometer to ensure they reach safe levels. 

When proofing dough, maintain a low temperature (85°F to 100°F) to activate yeast without risking undue heating. For dehydrating foods, temperatures between 100°F and 225°F are effective based on the type of food being processed.

Additionally, specific functions for operational preferences allow for custom settings, such as continuous cooking, clock adjustments, and factory defaults. Ensure to observe safety notices, especially regarding the Sabbath mode and any related operational adjustments.

**Clock and Operation Settings**  
To adjust the clock or operation hours, refer to the preferences section. If there is an interruption in power, the clock will display ClO and flash. To set the clock, press USER PREF, then select ClO, HI, or LO to adjust the time. Press START to confirm changes and return to the main menu. 

To restore factory settings, including the clock ON/OFF and operating hours, press USER PREF, select rSt, and confirm with START. For temperature settings, access USER PREFERENCES, then choose between Fahrenheit (F) and Celsius (C) with options pressing ClO or HI. 

**Self-Cleaning Instructions**  
Enable the self-clean feature with caution. Wear protective gear when manually cleaning. The oven must be off or cool before cleaning. Avoid using harsh cleaners or coatings; these can damage the self-cleaning mechanism. 

Ensure racks are removed prior to initiating self-cleaning. Allow sufficient time for the oven to cool after self-cleaning completes — this typically takes around one hour. Press OVEN, select the desired cleaning duration (MED, ClEAN), then press START. The DOOR light will flash during this process. 

After completion, the oven will cool, and the DOOR indicator will display once it’s safe to open. Children should be kept away from the cleaning process. 

**Regular Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Regular cleaning is essential to reduce future maintenance. Remove spills and heavy soiling promptly. For painted and decorative surfaces, lightly wipe with a non-abrasive cloth and cleaner. Avoid scouring pads that could permanently damage finishes.

To maintain the area around the heating elements, use a damp cloth without strong cleaners. Ensure surfaces are free from grease and food residue to maintain performance. 

Follow safety precautions while cleaning to prevent burns. Allow sufficient cooling time and use protective gear as necessary.
