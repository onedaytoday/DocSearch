### Food Care and Cleaning Guidelines

**Caution for Operation**: It's essential for authorized technicians to handle the carrying, cooling, and recharging operations of the appliance. Regular cleaning is necessary to maintain hygiene and performance.

**Cleaning Procedures**: The appliance should be cleaned occasionally using suitable cleaning products to avoid damage. Only clean the exterior casing with recommended cleaners to ensure the plastics remain intact and functioning optimally. Cleaning should occur at least once a year, following the manufacturer’s guidelines upon purchase.

**Defrosting Instructions**: To clean effectively, monitor frost buildup in the unit. If frost accumulates, it may lead to overflow; ensure that the defrosting process is managed correctly. Avoid letting frost interfere with food storage; maintain appropriate temperatures to prevent spoilage.

**Troubleshooting and Warnings**: If there are any unusual sounds or flashing lights, it is crucial to investigate promptly as these may indicate operational issues. Components like the door should be checked for correct closure, as improper sealing can cause performance problems. If the appliance frequently operates in "FROSTMATIC" or "COOLMATIC" mode, or if there is excess moisture, addressing these conditions will help maintain functionality.

**Installation Guidelines**: Proper installation is essential for optimal performance. Ensure that the appliance is positioned in a suitable environment as specified in the technical data (operating temperatures: SN +10°C to +32°C, ST +16°C to +38°C).
