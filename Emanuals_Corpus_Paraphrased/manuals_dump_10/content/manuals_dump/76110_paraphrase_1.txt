- **WARNING**: Non-compliance may result in significant hazards. Adhere strictly to the guidelines provided, especially those regarding installation and operation.
- **CAUTION**: Improper handling or installation can cause property damage or personal injury.

**Fire Prevention Measures**
To minimize the risk of fire or electric shock, observe the following:
- Use fire-rated materials for any connected ductwork and follow the guidelines set by relevant authorities such as the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).
- Ensure proper service and maintenance procedures. Always turn off the system before servicing and secure any switches to prevent accidental activation. 
- Ductwork should be thermally insulated to a standard greater than R40 to reduce fire risk.

**Grease Fire Prevention**
To mitigate the chances of a top grease fire:
- Stay alert when cooking at high temperatures and during greasy food preparation. 
- Regularly clean grease from surfaces and cookware. 
- In case of a fire, smother flames with a lid, turn off heat, and exercise caution to avoid burns. 
- Never attempt to pick up a flaming pan; instead, evacuate the area and call emergency services. Use a Class ABC fire extinguisher if necessary.
