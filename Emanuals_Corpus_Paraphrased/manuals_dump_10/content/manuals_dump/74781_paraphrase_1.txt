To ensure proper operation, it’s important to maintain the fridge with doors securely closed. This allows for efficient cooling by managing temperature and humidity levels. Food items should be placed on shelves to naturally reach optimal cooling without causing frost build-up on each other. The shelves need to be arranged appropriately, either by adjusting their height or positioning them correctly at the back of the unit.

Different food types should be stored at designated shelf heights: confectionery, ready-to-eat meals, fresh meats, dairy products, bottled items, and seafood, all with specific requirements for temperature control. This is indicated in the user manual, which outlines how to properly cool various food types.

To initiate the FROSTMATIC function, press the appropriate button (H). This function is designed to protect fresh food and expedite cooling. The system will indicate when the desired temperature is reached via lights and sounds. If the FROSTMATIC mode needs to be turned off manually, the yellow light will indicate the function's current status.

When switching off the appliance, use the main power button (A). Be sure to clean the fridge regularly to maintain food safety and functionality. Pay attention to the storage capacity for fresh food, which should be managed to avoid compromising the cooling efficiency.

To prevent food from thawing, refrain from overcrowding and allow air circulation within the storage compartments. Never store liquids too tightly sealed, as they can expand and burst when frozen.

Regular maintenance, including defrosting and cleaning internal components, is crucial. If any operational issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting section in the manual for guidance. Proper care will greatly enhance the longevity and efficiency of the fridge.

If necessary, consult with a technician for electrical issues or if parts require replacing. Adhere to all safety instructions mentioned in the user manual to prevent electrical hazards.

**Paraphrased Text:**

This chart outlines the proper storage methods for various fresh foods, including meat, which should be kept airtight. Roasted meat and minced meat should also be stored in sealed containers to maintain freshness. Cold, grease-proof packaging is recommended for these items. Additional foods such as sour curds, peas, beans, and assorted berries require similar airtight containers.

For ready-to-eat foods, ensure they are stored correctly for optimal preservation. The shelf life varies by product, with recommendations for soups and meat broths to be kept at specified temperatures to prevent spoilage.
