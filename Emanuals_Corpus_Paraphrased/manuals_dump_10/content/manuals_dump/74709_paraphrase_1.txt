To operate the appliance effectively, familiarize yourself with the thermostat and its settings. To adjust the thermostat, switch it to 'ON' or 'OFF' as needed. The ideal setting may vary based on factors such as food type, room temperature, and frequency of door openings. If food items remain frozen longer than necessary, check if the thermostat is set too high or if the cooling plate is malfunctioning. Know when to switch to defrost mode. Ensure that food is stored correctly, wrapped appropriately, and arranged to allow optimal airflow.

**HINTS AND TIPS**  
To maintain food quality, do not overcrowd the appliance with items. Keep foods covered and stored properly to prevent cross-contamination. Monitor the condition of your food and ensure it is consumed by the recommended expiration dates. Do not refreeze thawed foods unless they are cooked.

Always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning. Use a damp cloth for the interior surfaces.

To replace the light bulb, turn off the appliance, disconnect it from the power, and carefully remove the light cover.
