**NGA CLD Overview**

The CLD has been thoroughly evaluated at the factory, including its reaction chamber and associated components. Testing involved interactions with high NO levels to ensure proper operation under Emerson's warranty conditions. Note that all electrical connections must comply with NAMUR and DIN VDE standards. Power supply connections to the platform and network are crucial for functionality.

The NGA Platform features connections to other NGA power supplies and sampling balance regulators as outlined in the Installation Instructions (HAS60E-IM-HW). The power supply board includes various connectors (J1, J2, J3, etc.) for efficient integration. Color codes are specified for various junctions, including sensors and detectors, ensuring correct assembly and operation.

**NGA CLD Startup and Calibration**

Once assembled, the CLD is ready for operations as described in this section, assuming familiarity with the interfacing software. The system initializes upon connection to the platform, which will initiate the boot-up sequence. Users can interact with the software interface to conduct tasks like scanning and configuring the device.

Calibrations must be performed to maintain analytical accuracy, with known reference standards applied at least every few hours. This ensures that any influencing factors affecting measurement reliability are accounted for. Instructions on operation, calibration, and diagnostics are provided, allowing for thorough system checks, including operational status and readiness for measurement.

For operational preparation, ensure that the CLD is calibrated and all functions are set to parameters that support accurate flow measurement. Calibrating the flow converter involves settled conditions according to defined procedures. The instructions further specify necessary adjustments for optimal performance.

System network integration allows for seamless control and measurement across different I/O modules, facilitating user selection of measurement sources and configurations. Ensure that selections reflect the current configuration and are verified through the interface.

In summary, this document serves as a comprehensive guide for operating, calibrating, and maintaining the NGA CLD system, ensuring users can confidently manage their applications with accuracy and reliability.

### Instruction HAS60E-IM-HW NGA CLD Interface

The NGA CLD interface provides various options for connection and communication, including RS232 and MODBUS RTU protocols. The Serial I/O (SIO) interface supports settings for parity, such as "Enabled" and "Xoff," and includes three relays that can be configured as Normally Open (NO) or Normally Closed (NC). You can choose to enable or disable the relay operations and set the operational parameters via the interface.

### Temperature Adjustment of Converter

The adjustment settings are crucial to maintain efficiency. Typically, recommended values ensure that performance aligns with environmental regulations. Operating temperatures above or below specified ranges can adversely affect efficiency, particularly for chemiluminescent reactions. Start-up and active operation periods are defined for optimal performance, typically within a specified range to prevent efficiency losses.

### Measurement of Converter Efficiency

Users are responsible for routinely monitoring the efficiency of the NO-to-NO conversion, ideally at least once per month. It’s critical to establish baseline measurements and analyze them in relation to atmospheric conditions or changes in material composition. Referencing READINGS should be taken under specific conditions to ensure accuracy.
