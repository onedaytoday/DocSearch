### Application Connectivity Overview
EMC Application Connectivity (ACM) provides services for TCP-based applications, detailing their relationships and root-cause analyses through the topology of connected devices such as servers and routers.

### Connectivity Checks
ACM performs TCP connectivity checks and identifies symptoms, including:
- **TCP TimedOutSymptom:** Indicates that a service (like SMTP or HTTP) may not be functioning.
- **SlowSymptom:** Suggests potential latency issues affecting network performance.

### Conclusion
This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for optimizing and troubleshooting EMC Application Connectivity, ensuring users can efficiently manage their service topology and connectivity status.

### Overview of EMC Application Connectivity

The EMC Application Connectivity provides an expected interaction with TCP, specifically in relation to services such as SMTPService and HTTPService. Performance issues, like slow response times (SlowSymptom) or timeouts (TimedOutSymptom), can affect application connectivity. These issues are visually represented, with affected applications highlighted in red, signalling their current status may shift to yellow due to networking conditions.

The architecture consists of various components, including ServiceOffering and ServiceSubscriber, along with the DNSService, which plays a vital role in the overall connectivity. The application also offers insights into the status of related services within the network, reflecting the severity of connectivity issues connected to business operations.
