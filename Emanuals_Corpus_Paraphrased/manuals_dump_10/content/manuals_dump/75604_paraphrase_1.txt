### Technical Overview of Chilling System

The 20GN1/1 model facilitates the cooling of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly reducing bacterial growth within this temperature span before further lowering to -18°C in under four hours. This system is designed for effective chilling and freezing, maintaining food quality during storage at these temperatures for extended periods.

**Operating Modes:**
- Soft Chilling: +3°C
- Chilling: -18°C

The unit incorporates continuous operation modes, allowing for efficient monitoring and management. It features built-in UV capabilities, defrosting options, and service information displays that include countdowns. 

Upon reaching -14°C, the system enters a temporary holding phase, transitioning to -36°C and eventually -40°C. Critical operational data is recorded, including HACCP compliance, especially during abnormal terminations.

**Performance Metrics:**
The chilling process is optimized to transition from +90°C to +3°C in less than four hours, adhering to various food types and regulatory standards. 

**Construction Specifications:**
- Material: AISI stainless steel with high-density polyurethane insulation (HCFC-free)
- Design: Rounded corners and compliant with ISO standards, equipped with IP20 protection.

**Included Features:**
- Accessory: HACCP printer
- Sensors: Multiple temperature sensors for precision
- Accessories: Various GN sizes, along with essential components for rapid cooling
- Installation: Requires plumbing for optimal operation; optional features include screw connections and high thermostat settings.

Overall, this chilling system is engineered for efficiency, reliability, and compliance with health and safety regulations, ensuring food quality throughout the chilling and freezing processes.
