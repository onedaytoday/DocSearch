This revision adopts a structured and formal tone while preserving the original meaning and details.

Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

Choose the desired operation from the available options. Adjust the dial to select the appropriate setting, then refer to the display for guidance on the chosen settings. The dial can be rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise. To turn the machine off, rotate the dial to the OFF position. If you adjust to another option while the light indicator is active, the display will show the new selection.

Select the TEMPERATURE option to set the wash temperature; pressing the button repeatedly will increase or decrease the temperature. Choose between NIGHT CYCLE or RINSE HOLD options as needed. The display will show the corresponding indicators for the selected options. Be aware that when selecting RINSE HOLD, the light indicates that the DOOR is locked, and the programmed cycle will run without progressing to the next phase until manually changed.

For detailed guidance, please refer to the relevant chapter regarding option combinations. Note that options cannot be activated simultaneously. Should you want to assess the selected options, press the appropriate button to view settings, which will appear on the display. To utilize the PREWASH setting, select it for a 30°C cycle, which is advised for synthetic fabrics. This option is recommended for heavily soiled garments.

The STAIN option is also available for items requiring extra care. If you select the SENSITIVE option, it will lower the wash intensity for delicate fabrics. The EXTRA RINSE option caters to users who need additional rinsing to eliminate any detergent residues, especially for individuals with sensitivities. 

For efficiency, the TIME SAVING option expedites the washing process, offering settings for DAILY and SUPER QUICK washes for lightly soiled items. Use the START/PAUSE function to begin the selected program; a locked light will confirm the cycle is running. If the cycle experiences interruption, the countdown will pause.

The DELAY START function allows you to set the program to begin at a later time, adjustable in hourly increments. Once set, the system indicates the countdown on the display. Following the guidelines, ensure optimal washing outcomes and consider sorting items into whites, colors, and fabrics for best results.

For any urgent stains, treat them promptly and ensure garments are prepared for the wash in accordance with fabric care guidelines. If using bleach, take care not to mix it with certain colored fabrics. Ensure forgotten tasks are completed before running the machine, as washing programs can result in the misformation of settings if not properly addressed. 

Select appropriate washing programs based on fabric type, utilizing programs like HYGIENE for thorough cleaning at 60°C, aimed at enhancing cleanliness and sanitization. Follow the instructions for correct load limits and washing cycle information. 

Utilize gentle programming for delicates such as synthetics and viscose. Features like the DRAINING and SPIN options assist in the efficient handling of washed items. Various settings for outdoor and sports clothing are designed to accommodate specific care needs. Each tailored option optimizes the cleaning process according to the fabric type and soil level.

Here's a paraphrased version of your text:

The effectiveness of the SUPER ECO Cold program varies depending on the type of fabric, particularly with synthetic materials, and operates efficiently at temperatures below 6°C. The ENERGIESPAREN ECONOMIQUE function applies to both white and colored items and is designed to enhance efficiency. It can be activated to halt heating when no prewash is selected. For wash cycles set at 40°C or higher, pressing the relevant button will reduce the washing time as indicated.

For care and cleaning, always disconnect the appliance from the power supply before performing any maintenance. Regular cleaning is essential to prevent residue buildup, particularly in the drum and components. Ensure to use non-abrasive cleaning products. Always clean the drain pump and hose carefully and inspect them for any blockages. If necessary, follow the procedure to release any accumulated water from the emptying hose and return it securely to its position.

In the event of issues, such as the yellow light illuminating with a periodic sound, it's important to troubleshoot by following the suggested steps. If the household temperature drops below 0°C, precautions should be taken when handling hoses, considering their susceptibility to freezing.

Ensure all connections are secure, the appropriate cycle settings are chosen, and any blockages are cleared for optimal performance. The appliance's specifications can be found in the technical data section, which includes water consumption rates for different fabric types.

For installation, ensure all hoses are appropriately connected and check for any kinks that may obstruct water flow. The positioning of the appliance should not impede accessibility or ventilation. Electrical connections should comply with safety regulations, ensuring proper grounding.

Environmental considerations include treating the appliance responsibly and recycling accordingly. For any replacement parts or service needs, refer to the manufacturer or authorized service providers. Following these guidelines will help maintain the appliance's efficiency and longevity.
