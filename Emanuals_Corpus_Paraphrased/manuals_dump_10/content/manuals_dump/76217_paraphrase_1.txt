When operating the washing machine, ensure you follow the specific guidelines for each fabric type and washing settings, particularly those indicated for temperatures up to 60°C. Synthetics, including easy-care items like nightgowns, pyjamas, tablecloths, work shirts, tea shirts, and pillowcases, should be treated according to these recommendations. 

For delicates, include items such as silk and lace, which require careful handling during the wash. Wool items, such as bathrobes, should only be washed on the appropriate wool setting to avoid damage.

When using laundry bleach, select one suitable for colors and whites. For stain removal, consider products like VANISH In-Wash or GloWhite, which can be added directly to the detergent for effective results on new stains. Softening sheets like Bounce should be used with delicate fabrics, and fabric conditioners can help manage easy-care items.

It's crucial to adhere to the washing machine's instructions regarding maximum loads and settings for non-bio detergents, which should include brands like Fairy for maintenance of colored items. Follow the outlined guidance for compact powders and liquids, and use the specified dosage instructions found on the detergent packaging.

Turning the machine on and off should be managed carefully, utilizing options like EXTRA RINSE or RINSE HOLD as needed. If using a prewash or stain program, ensure the selected options are clearly indicated by their respective lights on the control panel.

To initiate a wash cycle, simply press START/PAUSE, and monitor the indicator lights for progress. If using the DELAY START feature, select your preferred time setting, and the countdown will initiate once START/PAUSE is pressed.

### Economy Selection and Washing Instructions

For normal washing of white fabrics, choose the Economy setting instead of 95C, which is typically set around 67C, to align with the 60C option as required. This setting is suitable for synthetic items, including colored shirts and towels, which should be washed at 40C in Cold mode. Use the Quick Stain Prewash for heavily soiled items and select the Extra Rinse or Rinse Hold options as needed. 

For prewashing and rinsing, it is important to use appropriate additives. The machine facilitates care for synthetic, lightly soiled household items and whites. If a cleaning issue arises, address it either by checking the cleaning mechanism or ensuring the drainage hose is functioning correctly. 

### Maintenance and Cleaning Procedures

To ensure optimal performance, inspect the rear corner of the machine for any obstructions. Clean the top of the recess with a toothbrush, and in the event of a blockage, detach the drainage hose to clear it. Avoid prolonged exposure of the machine to water without proper cleaning protocols in place to prevent damage and maintain efficiency.

### Troubleshooting and Error Codes

If any issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting section. For error codes such as E00, E10, or E20, follow the respective resolutions. If the machine is not functioning properly, verify that all connections are secure, particularly those of the drainage hose. Should the machine fail to operate or produce unusual sounds, check for clogged or improperly installed components.

### Additional Notes

It is crucial to handle the products and settings correctly for effective cleaning results, particularly when dealing with stubborn stains or specific fabric types. Employ the correct wash cycles and settings based on fabric care labels and machine guidelines for optimal outcomes.
