### MAN-OCSIG DC Specifications 

The DC power supply adheres to specific technical standards, particularly those outlined in EN60950 and relevant directives. It is deemed suitable for isolated AC inputs, designed to activate protection features in accordance with EN60742. The DC supply must meet the following criteria: it should be a single-phase rectified DC output as recommended. The installation location should be optimal for both the amplifier and safety regulations, particularly considering high-inertia loads.

### MAN-OCSIG Thermal Management

To manage heat dissipation from the assembly, the thermal resistance (C/W) should be considered. The thermal response time is approximately a few seconds for the system to reach its shut-off temperature, with specific thresholds measured in degrees Celsius. The thermal characteristics are illustrated in the accompanying graph.

### MAN-OCSRIG DC Motor Connections

For DC motors connected via J1 of the system, it is crucial that they are correctly wired to terminals M2 and M3. The command and input voltages must operate within specified limits. Should the input conditions change, resistors may be employed to ensure the voltage remains within acceptable parameters. The ECLC and ECLP signals must be routed properly from J1/9 (ECLC) to J1/8 (ECLRET) while maintaining internal voltage levels above 3.75V.

### ECLC and ECLP Specifications

The internal voltage levels at J1/9 (ECLC) and J1/8 (ECLRET) must adhere to the specified threshold of 3.75V. The system monitors these voltage levels, resulting in specific actions when thresholds are exceeded. 

### Indications and Fault Protection
