**Assembly Guidance**

When assembling, ensure the following steps are followed precisely:
- Secure the table top using M8 screws at each corner.
- Attach the stanchions firmly, ensuring they align correctly with the top.
- Install the ON/OFF switch on the right-hand side using M8 screws.
- Connect the suction hose properly to the designated ports to ensure efficient operation.

**Final Checks:** Once all components are assembled, verify that screws are tightened, and test the system to ensure proper functionality. 

For additional assistance or clarification, please refer to the corresponding assembly chapter within this document.

The other head attaches only to the right-hand side of the right front, aligned with the "Technical Specifications." It should be correctly installed, grounded, and verified. Three-phase outlets must include wiring and adhere to the specified rating for Residual Current Device (RCD) protection. Ensure the supply systems are safeguarded against overheating, following the guidelines in the "Technical Specifications." 

When connecting the phases, be aware that incorrect phase rotation can lead to operational hazards. Ensure the assembly is correctly oriented to avoid injuries and always toggle the power switch OFF before conducting any adjustments or maintenance. Protective measures include using hearing protection, particularly while operating near moving components.

If using the equipment, be cautious of cords or materials that may become ensnared during operation. The operation height should be adjusted such that no part can become caught when turning the mechanism. The height adjustments must allow for safe operation without obstruction.

For cleaning and maintenance, follow safety protocols: switch off power and allow components to cool. Ensure the head screw is turned correctly to avoid damage (take note of left-hand threads). Routine inspections are mandatory, especially after extended use. 

Transportation and disassembly guidelines should be adhered to, ensuring that all parts, such as the suction and resin components, are handled correctly. 

Regular troubleshooting should be conducted, especially if overheating or increased chip buildup is observed. Each service requires thorough checks to ensure optimal performance and safety compliance. Wearing hearing protection is advised during operation to minimize noise exposure.

Follow the technical specifications concerning sound levels to comply with safety standards, and be aware of the hearing protection requirements during machine operation.
