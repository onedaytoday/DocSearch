### Conclusion

Thank you for choosing our product. Following these guidelines will help ensure optimal performance and safety. Always prioritize safety in your cooking practices.

**Cleaning Instructions**  
To clean the appliance, follow the guidelines provided in the Cleaning section. Ensure that all parts are clean after use. To access certain components, reach through the designated opening at the front, as illustrated. While holding the release mechanism, pull gently on the front to separate both sides and remove the cavity walls. Exercise care to avoid damaging any parts; do not forcefully detach the back of the cavity.

**Preheating Settings**  
Use the following conversion for preheating:  
- **Convection Settings**: 550°F (288°C), 400°F (204°C), 300°F (148°C), and 190°F (88°C).  
- Factory defaults are set at 350°F (176°C) for preheating. Utilize the appropriate button to start the preheat process. When preheating is active, the display will indicate this, and a tone will signal completion.

**Clock Settings**  
To set or reset the clock:  
- Press the relevant button when there is a power interruption. Use START to confirm your settings. If self-cleaning or cooking functions are active, adjust accordingly. The clock defaults to a 12-hour format but can be switched to 24-hour mode.

**Cooking Instructions**  
Maintain food safety by adhering to cooking time guidelines. If the cooking process exceeds the specified time, the appliance may switch off automatically. Preheat food items according to type — use the oven for cookies and baked goods, and only directly cook food recommended for high temperatures.

**Broiling Instructions**  
To broil food, preheat to the recommended temperature for the specific food type. Ensure proper clearance for cookware and avoid direct grease contact with heating elements to prevent hazards or fires. Follow the broiling table’s recommendations carefully for safety and optimal results. 

**Convection Cooking Settings**  
Convection cooking evenly distributes heat, improving cooking efficiency. For optimal results, use the specified settings and follow cooking instructions closely. 

Always refer to the instruction manual for detailed operating procedures related to cooking, cleaning, and maintenance to ensure safe and effective use of the appliance.

**Convection Cooking Instructions**

The convection feature allows you to adjust cooking settings and prepare various foods efficiently. For optimal performance, set the oven to the factory temperature of 350°F (176°C): Press "CONV BAKE" to activate the setting and begin preheating. A tone will indicate when the oven is ready. You can cancel cooking at any time.

For foods that require a cooking temperature of 375°F (191°C), activate the "CONV ROAST" function by pressing the appropriate buttons and then "START." Similarly, a tone will signal when cooking is finished or if the process is canceled. Follow specific guidelines for each type of food to ensure proper cooking and safety.

Convection cooking circulates hot air around the food, allowing for even cooking, especially with meats and poultry. When roasting, ensure that you minimize cover usage to allow proper heat circulation and reduce cooking time. Use a shallow pan to facilitate airflow, and securely place food items to avoid spills.

**Cooking Temperatures and Safety Precautions**

Keep in mind the recommended cooking temperatures to prevent foodborne illness. Use the "KEEP WARM" function by pressing the relevant buttons and "START" to maintain temperature after cooking is complete. It's important that meats are heated to at least 170°F (76°C), and food items like soups should reach safe temperatures to avoid bacteria growth.

For further clarification on cooking times and temperatures, refer to the provided chart. Ensure that all food is cooked thoroughly before serving.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**

The self-cleaning feature is designed to simplify cleanup by using high heat to burn off residues. To initiate, select a suitable cycle (2, 3, or 4 hours) and press "START." The oven door will lock, and it's crucial not to attempt to open it until the cycle is complete and the oven has cooled.

During self-cleaning, avoid using harsh cleaners or metal scrapers that could damage the interior. Make sure to keep children away from the oven during this process. After self-cleaning, allow the oven to cool down and wipe down any remaining residues with a damp cloth. 

If you need to restore factory settings, follow the specific instructions for resetting. This may include adjusting the clock format or temperature calibration. Always refer to the manual for any additional cleaning or operational details.

**Self-Cleaning Guidelines:**

To initiate the self-cleaning mode, press the designated button. Ensure the oven is set to high heat for thorough cleaning. After the cycle, allow sufficient time for the oven to cool before resetting. If you need to self-clean again, the oven must be fully cooled down from the previous cycle, which can take several hours.

If the self-cleaning process is interrupted, it is crucial to allow the oven to cool completely before attempting another cycle. The display may indicate when it is appropriate to restart self-cleaning, typically after a specific timeframe.

**Cleaning Instructions:**

For painted or decorative surfaces, use a soft cloth and avoid abrasive cleaners that could scratch. Focus on the top and front surfaces, ensuring the oven is closed securely during the self-cleaning cycle. Always refer to the operating manual for specific cleaning products that are safe to use.

**Safety Precautions:**

Exercise caution as the oven will be extremely hot post-cleaning. Avoid touching the oven's interior until it has cooled completely. Use protective gear where necessary to prevent burns. 

**General Maintenance:**

Regularly check and clean the dishwasher and cabinet areas using a damp cloth, avoiding harsh cleaners that may scratch surfaces. If there are any signs of cleaning or operational issues, consult the service section or contact the support number provided.

For optimal performance, ensure that food items are not blocking heat flow, and always adhere to preheating and cooking guidelines mentioned in the manual.

**Troubleshooting:**

If your appliance exhibits issues such as error messages (e.g., F10) or difficulty in starting, follow the troubleshooting steps outlined in the user manual or reach out to customer service for assistance. Always prioritize maintaining the recommended clearance around the appliance for proper ventilation and performance.
