**Important:** Follow these instructions for proper operation and commissioning. 

### Specifications and Responsibilities

- **Optional Assembly and Commissioning:** 
  - 1-Phase
  - 3-Phase
  - Direction of Rotation
  - Switch Protection
  - Release Functions
  - Collector Information

#### Application Specifications
- For various operational heights and spacing, refer to the tables. Ensure compliance with DIN standards for noise levels (L WA rounded to measurements). Conformance to these specifications is the userâ€™s responsibility. Any defects or wear must be addressed immediately.

### Dimensions and Definitions
- **Mounting Height:** 
  - Moulding Strips, Boards, and Workpiece Tenons.
  
- **Assembly Details:** 
  - Each assembly should include self-locking screws and appropriate anchoring for stability during operation.

### Electrical Connection
- **1-Phase:** 
  - Connect to a correctly earthed outlet protected by a residual current device (RCD) with sufficient capacity of 230V.
  
- **3-Phase:** 
  - Connect using a 16A CEE type plug, ensuring it is earthed and protected by RCD, with proper supply of 400V.

### Motor Rotation
- For three-phase motors, the standard rotation is counter-clockwise when viewed from the top. Ensure correct wiring of leads, particularly the yellow-green ground.

### Protection and Safety Features
- The system includes built-in protection relays that will deactivate the machine under certain conditions. Ensure the release switch is properly connected.

### Collector Operation
- Follow the guidelines to connect and operate the collector. Be aware of any materials that may have carcinogenic properties.

### Manual Handling and Feeding
- Use protective measures while operating. Utilize pushsticks or blocks to prevent direct hand contact with moving parts. 

### Moulding Operations
- This TF moulding machine is designed for a variety of materials including laminated boards and plastics. Ensure all components are correctly mounted. 

### Maintenance Guidelines
- Clean and service regularly to avoid resin buildup and maintain optimal operation. Pay attention to the feed and pushblock mechanics during operation to ensure continuous production.

### U.K. Legislation Compliance
- Be aware of applicable legal requirements for operating machinery within the U.K. and adhere strictly to all health and safety regulations. 

**Caution:** If there is any uncertainty during electrical or mechanical operations, consult a qualified professional.
