**Cookware and Heating Characteristics**

Different types of cookware exhibit varied heating properties. For instance, aluminum cookware heats food efficiently, but may scratch easily. Copper is known for its excellent heat conductivity, while stainless steel is durable and easy to clean. Cast iron retains heat effectively but requires time to reach the desired temperature. Porcelain-enamel metal cookware has a smooth coating that is prone to scratching and is not recommended for high-temperature use.

Glass cookware is also not advisable due to its susceptibility to scratches. The "ELEMENT ON" indicator light illuminates when the surfaces are active and should be monitored. Once cooking is completed, ensure all heating elements are turned off. The indicator lights are positioned accordingly to reflect when the respective elements are heating or have cooled down to a moderate state, as detailed in the accompanying chart which categorizes food types based on their recommended cooking temperatures.

The warmer function is intended for maintaining the temperature of cooked foods such as soups and pastries. It is recommended to use a cover to retain heat when placing food in the warmer. Use potholders when handling hot items, as improper handling can lead to burns.

**Cooking Controls and Functions**

To initiate the cooking process or preheat the oven, press the "CLOCK" and "START" buttons as prompted. During preheating, the timer operates independently, counting down while the oven reaches the preset temperature.

For convection cooking, adjustments may be necessary to accommodate different food items. The convection setting circulates heat for even cooking, which can result in faster cooking times. This function is particularly useful for items like cakes and breads.

When utilizing various cooking modes, it is crucial to adhere to recommended temperature guidelines to prevent overcooking or browning. Timers can be set to enhance cooking accuracy.

**Food Safety Advisory**

Food poisoning risks increase when foods, especially meat, are left out for over an hour. Proper handling and cooking practices are essential to prevent foodborne illnesses. Always monitor cooking times closely to ensure safety.

In summary, understanding the specific heating characteristics of different cookware types is essential for optimal cooking performance and food safety. Always follow guidelines for best practices in cooking and handling food items.

This version maintains the original information while presenting it in a clearer and more organized manner.

The Convection Convert option enables users to optimize cooking performance for food items by using convection heat. When cooking, it’s essential to ensure that hot air circulates evenly around the food. The recommended cooking temperature starts at 350°F (177°C). To begin, select the CONV BAKE or CONV ROAST option, adjust the temperature as necessary, and then press START once the desired temperature is reached. 

For meats and poultry, cooking times and temperatures may vary, but the general guideline is to preheat to around 350°F (177°C) and ensure even cooking using the Convection Roasting Chart. It’s crucial to cover meats properly when roasting to retain moisture. If necessary, increase cooking times if the desired outcome isn’t achieved.

When cooking bread and pastry, the function allows for even heating from top to bottom. The Breads function preheats efficiently, ensuring thorough cooking. Monitoring the internal temperatures is vital, with a minimum of 170°F (77°C) recommended for safe consumption.

For optimal results, avoid opening the oven frequently, and use appropriate cookware. The self-cleaning feature requires following specific instructions to ensure safety and effectiveness. For frozen foods, make sure to thaw completely before cooking. 

Always utilize food thermometers to check that meats reach safe internal temperatures, and cancel cooking functions as needed. The settings may differ based on the type of food and its thickness, so reference the appropriate guides for best results.

### Warmer Instructions

**General Use of the Warmer**  
To effectively use the warmer for cooking food, it is advised that the food be properly placed inside the warmer. When retrieving food, ensure you use potholders or coverings to prevent burns from cookware, plates, or surfaces that may be hot. To reduce the risk of food poisoning, do not leave food in the warmer for more than one hour, especially for perishable items. After cooking, food should be returned to the warmer immediately, and any other items nearby should be kept away from the warmer's heating elements.

**Child Safety**  
Children should never be left unattended near the warmer. Supervision is crucial when they are around the warmer's operation or hot surfaces.

**Warmer Controls**  
The warmer has an upright design, with a control panel that operates various temperatures (low, medium, high). The indicator light will show when the warmer is on or off. To turn on the warmer, set the desired temperature and ensure all food items are covered to maintain warmth and prevent contamination.

### Clock and Timer Functions

To set the clock, press the "SET CLOCK" button followed by the "START" or "CANCEL" buttons, which allows you to select the preferred hour and minute settings. The factory presets can be adjusted based on personal preferences. Similarly, the timer feature can be set to either pulsate or stay on depending on your needs.

### Self-Cleaning Feature

The self-cleaning function utilizes high temperatures to break down any food residues within the oven. To ensure safety during this procedure, allow the oven to cool first. It’s advisable to wear protective gear while cleaning. Manual cleaning is required for any heavy build-up or burnt-on residues. 

Avoid blocking the locking mechanisms during the self-cleaning cycle. Once the cycle is complete and the oven cools, indicated by a "DOOR LOCKED" light, you may open the oven.

### Manual Cleaning Guidelines

For regular maintenance, use a non-abrasive cloth to clean the outer surfaces and avoid harsh chemicals that can damage the finish. Ensure that the interior, including walls and cooktops, is cleaned with appropriate cleaners to prevent grease buildup. Always handle cleaning tools carefully to avoid scratches or damage to the oven’s surfaces.

### Final Note

When replacing any components or cleaning the light shield, ensure you follow proper procedures to avoid hazards. The light shield must always be in place during operation to ensure safety.

The cleaning process involves applying the recommended cleanser specifically designed for the cooking surface, using a towel for best results. It's essential to clean the surface promptly to prevent scratches, especially after heavy use or exposure to direct cooking. Always allow the cooktop to cool down completely and ensure it is turned off before cleaning. 

Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, like bleach or scouring pads, as these can damage the surface. For effective cleaning, follow the guidelines provided, taking care to remove food residues immediately after use. If you experience issues like burned-out bulbs or a tripped circuit, check the connections and reset any blown fuses per the user's manual.
