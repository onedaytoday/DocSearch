**Chillers GN Overview**  
The GN chillers rapidly cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, which helps reduce bacterial growth. By achieving this temperature, food can be stored safely at +3°C without compromising shelf life. The unit features various chilling modes, including Soft Chilling (down to 2°C) and standard cooling (around 20°C). 

**Operational Features**  
The chiller operates continuously, complying with NF and UK regulations, and includes UV protection (available as an accessory) alongside automatic defrosting. The interface provides countdowns and service information (P1, P2), enabling monitoring of operational data essential for HACCP compliance, especially if the system malfunctions.

**Performance Specifications**  
The chiller efficiently lowers food temperature from +90°C to +3°C and meets NF regulations.

**Construction and Insulation**  
Constructed from AISI materials, the unit features high-quality polyurethane insulation that is HCFC-free. It meets ISO standards and has rounded corners for safety and ease of cleaning. The unit is also designed for effective cleaning, with a thermostatic heating option available.

**Technical Data**  
Chiller productivity conforms to NF regulations and includes options for built-in or remote thermometers. 

**Included Accessories**  
- 3-Sensor Probe for Chiller/Freezer  
- Slide-in Rack Support for 10 BC/BCF (70 kg)  
- Single Sensor Probes for Chiller/Freezer  
- Remote Unit for Chiller/Freezer  
- Banquet Rack (70 kg capacity, accommodating 51 plates with a 75 mm pitch in a 10 GN2/1 layout)  
- Kit for HACCP with various probes and accessories  

**Installation Information**  
The chiller allows for plumbing options and is certified by AFAQ AFNOR, ensuring compliance with NF031 for hygiene and thermal performance.
