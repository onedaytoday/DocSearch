**Chillers GN Overview**

Electrolux chillers effectively cool cooked food from temperatures of +90°C to +3°C, which inhibits bacterial growth. The chillers maintain food at +3°C, ensuring safety without compromising quality. Various operating modes are available, including Soft Chilling (2°C) and Chilling at 20°C, allowing continuous cooling based on specific requirements. The equipment includes built-in UV and NF capabilities for additional sanitation, as well as defrosting features. Operational indicators display countdowns and service information (P1, P2) related to holding and performance, with HACCP compliance tracked in case of abnormal terminations.

**Performance Specifications**  
Cooling from +90°C to +3°C depends on food density and type. 

**Construction Details**  
The chillers are constructed from AISI-grade stainless steel with high-density polyurethane insulation, ensuring HCFC-free operation. The design includes rounded corners for ease of cleaning and is protected with an IP20 rating.
