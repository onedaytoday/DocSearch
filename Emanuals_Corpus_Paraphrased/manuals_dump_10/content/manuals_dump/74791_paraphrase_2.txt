### FROSTMATIC Overview

The FROSTMATIC function activates with a yellow indicator light, helping to preserve the freshness of food by quickly freezing it. If you choose to deactivate the FROSTMATIC function manually, you can do so via the control panel.

Over time, frost can accumulate within the appliance, particularly in the back section. This frost thickness should be monitored and removed when it becomes excessive. To defrost, adjust the thermostat to the appropriate setting, and when necessary, turn off the power supply. During defrosting, ensure the food is layered with newspaper to absorb moisture. 

To turn off the appliance, press the ON/OFF button, and watch for a countdown on the display — it will turn off automatically after several seconds. The FROSTMATIC indicator light will flash during this process. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining performance and preventing potential electrical shocks. Always ensure to disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning. For best results, use appropriate commercial cleaners, avoiding any corrosive substances. 

The temperature display will show the desired and current settings, which can be adjusted using the designated buttons. Ensure that food items are stored properly to prevent spoilage.

For any technical issues, consult the troubleshooting section or contact professional service for assistance. The appliance may also need repairs from an authorized service center to correct operational malfunctions safely.
