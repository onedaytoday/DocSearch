**CAUTION:** The device should not operate without considering the following guidelines; it should be powered down to prevent overheating or malfunction. For a D.P.D.T. switch, ensure the switch is turned correctly. If one position of the switch is activated, ensure the corresponding contacts are in the closed position. Proper insulation is required for each switch, and the chassis must be correctly grounded. The equipment should be maintained in a clean warehouse, free from hazards, with all protective covers securely in place to maintain warranty compliance.

Ensure that the heater and supply are adequately shielded. **CAUTION:** Disconnect incoming power before any repairs or adjustments. The switches must be accessed properly, avoiding obstructions. The assembly must be correctly seated; check the operation of the switch after reassembly.

When adjusting the mechanical switches, remember that correct seating is vital. The screws should not be overtightened or improperly configured to ensure the switch operates smoothly. Follow the specific procedures for opening and closing mechanisms, which involve turning screws counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close. Ensure that electrical power is disconnected prior to performing these tasks.
