### Cookware and Heating Overview

Aluminum cookware is effective in heating food but can become scratched easily. Copper heats quickly, while stainless steel provides efficient heating and is easy to clean. Cast iron retains heat well, but only after reaching the desired cooking temperature. Porcelain-enamel metal cookware is smooth but may scratch.

Glass cookware is generally not recommended as it can scratch easily. The "ELEMENT ON" light activates when cooking begins. This indicator will turn off once the heat is removed, which helps in monitoring the cooking process. 

Refer to the chart below to determine appropriate cooking temperatures based on food type. For high-temperature cooking, use settings that will effectively thicken or poach food. Always ensure pots and pans are removed from the stove to prevent burns.

To operate the stove correctly, ensure the cookware is securely positioned and the burner settings are properly adjusted. When cooking is complete, remember to turn the elements off to allow residual heat to dissipate. 

When using a warming feature, keep food covered to maintain heat for items like stews and baked goods. If cookware touches the warm surfaces, use potholders to avoid burns.

### Timer and Preheat Functionality

To start the cooking process, press the CLOCK button followed by START. In instances where timing is required, timers can be set to monitor cooking durations. To manage these features effectively:

1. Press the TIMER button to start counting.
2. Preheat settings will signal when the desired temperature is reached, ensuring the food cooks properly during roasting or baking.

The following are common preheat settings:
- 350°F (177°C)
- 170°F (77°C)
- 550°F (288°C)

When baking, press the appropriate buttons to initiate the preheating. Once the temperature is reached, an indicator will confirm readiness. 

Use the convection feature for even cooking; this may require adjusting cooking times slightly for different food items. 

### Safety and Efficiency

To prevent foodborne illness, ensure that foods like meats are cooked promptly and not left at unsafe temperatures. Follow cooking instructions closely to ensure optimal results, especially when using various racks and settings.

Overall, maintaining proper temperatures and utilizing the correct cookware enhances cooking efficiency while ensuring safety. Adhering to the established guidelines will facilitate excellent cooking outcomes and prevent potential hazards.

### Convection Cooking Instructions

The **Convection Convert** option optimizes cooking performance for various food items. To use this feature, food should be adequately heated around its circumference. The recommended cooking temperature is 350°F (177°C). To initiate, press **CONV BAKE** and then **START**. The appliance will notify you when preheating is complete.

When using **Convection Cooking** for meats and poultry, the heated air reduces cooking times. Adhere to the specified temperature guidelines for different types of meat, such as:

- Whole Meats: 350°F (177°C) to 400°F (204°C)
- Poultry: 325°F (160°C)
- Pre-cooked foods: 325°F (160°C)

Press **CONV ROAST** to proceed with roasting, ensuring to monitor for over-browning as per the provided charts. If adjustments are needed, consider increasing cooking times.

**Broiling** allows for grease drainage, enhancing cooking results. For effective broiling, maintain a proper distance from heating elements. 

### Baking and Bread Functions

The **Breads** function is designed to ensure even baking for items like cakes and custards. The preheating feature ensures that the oven adequately warms from top to bottom, improving overall cooking consistency. For items like cakes and breads, it is crucial to avoid overcrowding and ensure the proper use of cookware.

**Temperature Guidelines**: 
- Meats – Cook to internal temperatures of 170°F (77°C) for safety.
- Use a food thermometer to ensure thorough cooking, particularly for thick cuts or bone-in options.

**Slow Cooking and Preheating**

Utilize the **SLOW COOK** option to maintain temperatures suitable for longer cooking durations without burning. Select the desired setting and press **START** to begin. Always cancel if adjustments are needed.

Once cooking is complete, the oven will automatically shut off after the designated time. For restoring factory settings, refer to the manual instructions.

### Safety Note

To minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses, ensure that perishable items are cooked at proper temperatures without extended periods in the danger zone. Take care when handling hot foods, and allow them to cool appropriately before storing. Always refer to temperature guidelines for specific food types to ensure safety and quality.

### Warmer Usage and Safety Guidelines

**Operation of Warmer**  
The warmer is designed for heating cooked foods. It is recommended that food items be covered with lids or aluminum foil to maintain warmth. Always use potholders when removing hot items to avoid burns. Leaving food in the warmer for more than an hour may pose a risk of food poisoning. If food items have been chilled for over an hour, they should be reheated promptly to ensure safety. Keep items such as cookbooks, plasticware, and towels away from the warmer.

**Child Safety**  
Never leave children unattended near the warmer. They should be supervised around any cooking appliance.

**Placement and Heat Settings**  
Ensure the warmer is positioned upright for optimal heating. The settings include low, medium, and high heat levels, indicated by an activation light. This light illuminates when the warmer is on and turns off when it's not.

**Turning the Warmer On/Off**  
To operate the warmer, switch it on, then adjust the heat settings as necessary. Always turn the warmer off when you are finished using it.

**Clock and Timer Settings**  
To set the clock, press the "SET CLOCK" button and use the appropriate controls to select hours and minutes. The timer can be set and will indicate when the warmer is on or off.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**  
The self-clean feature uses high temperatures to eliminate residue and grease. Upon using this function, allow the warmer to cool down. Protective gear should be worn when cleaning, and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives. It is crucial to never force the door or locking mechanism during the self-clean process.

**Manual Cleaning**  
When performing manual cleaning, use a soft cloth to wipe down surfaces. Avoid abrasive cleaners that could scratch surfaces. If necessary, a damp cloth with a non-toxic cleaner can be employed for stubborn spots.

**Important Warnings**  
Keep in mind that the warmer may become excessively hot. All cleaning procedures should prioritize safety, especially wearing protective gear to avoid burns during maintenance. For optimal and safe operation, refer to the specific cleaning guidelines as indicated in the manufacturer’s instructions. Always ensure that the safety shields are in place whenever the oven is in use. 

### Conclusion

For cleaning, use the recommended cleaning products and techniques as outlined. Utilize a towel for wiping down surfaces. It's important to clean immediately after use to protect against scratches and damage. Ensure that the cooking surface has cooled down before cleaning to avoid cracking or further damage. Do not use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can scratch the surface. 

When cleaning, ensure that all food residues are removed promptly, especially after cooking high-fat foods. Turn off the appliance before cleaning and let it cool. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for self-cleaning features, and be aware of safety reminders regarding the electrical supply.
