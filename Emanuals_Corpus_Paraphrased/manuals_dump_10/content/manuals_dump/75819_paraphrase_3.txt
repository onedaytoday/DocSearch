Here's a technical paraphrase of the provided text that maintains its original meaning:

Food safety guidelines emphasize that food should be properly stored to minimize risks. It is advised to keep food at appropriate temperatures, such as maintaining cooked foods below 7°C and preventing them from being exposed to temperatures above 22°C. Moreover, regular meal prep and storage practices should be implemented weekly.

Following health and safety protocols is essential. When handling food, utilize airtight containers such as polythene bags or bottles to maintain freshness. Ensure all food items are cleaned thoroughly before use, and practice proper thawing techniques—preferably allowing items to thaw uncovered in a refrigerator.

For maintenance concerns, if devices do not seem to operate properly, immediately disconnect them from the electricity supply. Check all light fixtures and ensure they are correctly installed. Use caution when cleaning; avoid abrasive or scented products as they may damage surfaces or leave strong odors.

It is critical to maintain optimal operating temperatures within 10°C to 32°C while ensuring that the unit remains frost-free. In case of mechanical failure or irregular sounds, disconnect power and contact support for assistance. Food thawing should be conducted with care to prevent spoilage and ensure items are completely defrosted before cooking. Adhere to recommended guidelines for handling various food types, including meat and seafood, to ensure safety throughout the cooking process.
