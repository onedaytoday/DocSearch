**Important Safety Instructions**  
Follow all safety precautions detailed in this manual to prevent injury or property damage.  

**Warnings**:  
- To minimize the risk of grease buildup:  
  - Clean cooking surfaces frequently, especially when cooking at high heat.  
  - Smother flames with a lid and turn off the burner. EVACUATE and call the fire department if necessary.  
  - NEVER attempt to carry a flaming pan; avoid using water to extinguish flames unless using a Class ABC fire extinguisher.  

- To reduce the risk of electrical shock:  
  - Ensure proper grounding of the unit. Follow all guidelines from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).  

**Caution**:  
- Use caution when reaching for items. Keep all cooking areas clear of flammable materials and clean to avoid grease accumulation. Immediately turn off the blower if it overheats or if any issues arise.  

**Operating Your Hood**  
- Use the front push-buttons to operate the hood lights and blower. The light switch controls three settings: ON, brighter, and OFF. The blower switch adjusts to three speeds. The LED indicator will alert you when the blower has been on for an extended time. 

**Fuse and Electrical Box**  
- If the lights do not operate, disconnect power at the service entrance, check and replace the fuse if necessary.

**Caring for Your Range Hood**

### Non-Ducted Installation Instructions

**Note:** The following guidelines pertain to non-ducted installations of the model DFKTWC40EC. Ensure proper protection during installation. Utilize flat head screws for mounting the electrical system plate, flue mounting bracket, and other components as specified.

**Installation Process:**

2. Securely attach the hood to the wall using the provided mounting screws and anchors.
3. For ducted systems, connect the blower to the designated location.
4. Ensure that screws are tightened properly for stability.

**Ceiling Height Considerations:**
- For installations with 8-foot ceilings, the system may be concealed or exposed based on design.
- On systems with 9-foot ceilings, components may also be exposed.
- Systems with 10-foot ceilings utilize the EXWC45S model, and mounting methods may vary accordingly.

**Filter Installation:**
- Both ducted and non-ducted models require grease filters to be installed securely to prevent grease release.
- For non-ducted models, attach charcoal filters using the front latch mechanism to ensure proper fit.
