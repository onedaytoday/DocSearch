### Instructions for Using the Delay Timer

The Delay Timer (Zeitvorwahl, Depart Differe) lets you set a start time of up to a specified number of hours in advance. You can adjust the Delay Timer as frequently as needed until the desired time appears on the display. Once the timer is set and the Start/Pause button is activated, the washing process can proceed as programmed, including any soaking phases, whether or not a pre-wash is selected.

If the Door (TR, Porte) indicator is flashing, it indicates that the door is not properly closed. This will prevent the washing cycle from commencing, as the E40 warning light may also illuminate, along with the Main Wash (Hauptwäsche, Lavage) indicator. Ensure that the door is securely closed and the items inside are appropriately sorted for wash type.

### Pre-Wash and Soaking Instructions

When using the pre-wash or soaking settings, make sure to use the correct amount of detergent according to the recommendations for each compartment. The compartment for pre-wash (Vorwäsche, Prelavage) or soaking (EINWEICHEN, TREMPAGE) should not be overfilled; ensure you adhere to the maximum fill line. 

Select the desired cycle, then press Start/Pause. If adjustments to the delay are necessary while in the selection process, simply press the Delay Timer button until the desired time is displayed. You can also cancel the delay by pressing Start/Pause.

### Quick Wash and Additional Features

When using the Quick Wash (Kurz, Court) or Stain (Flecken, Taches) options, press Start/Pause to initiate. Ensure that the machine is set to OFF (AUS, ARRET) when performing any interventions, and if you choose Rinse Hold (SPLSTOPP, SANS ESSOR.), the Start/Pause light will flash.

### End of Cycle Procedures

When the cycle is complete, the End (Ende, Fin) indicator will illuminate. If Rinse Hold is selected, you may need to press Start/Pause again to proceed to the next steps (e.g., draining or spinning). Should any issues arise, such as over-dosing alongside the E40 alarm, refer to the user manual and ensure proper operation.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Regularly clean the washing machine exterior, door seal, and detergent compartments using a damp cloth. Use only mild cleaning agents that do not contain abrasive elements. 

### Troubleshooting

For error codes E10, E20, or E40, consult the troubleshooting section of the manual and contact customer service if necessary. Ensure all connections are tight, and hoses are properly secured. 

If you encounter issues related to drainage or incorrect settings being displayed, follow the user guide for adjustments, and inform customer service for assistance. Always ensure that the machine is off when performing maintenance or troubleshooting.

### Conclusion

These instructions aim to provide clarity on utilizing the Delay Timer, cycle options, and maintenance tasks efficiently, ensuring your washing experience is smooth and effective.

### Instructions

**Operation of the Light Indicator**  
The light indicator activates when the correct amount of detergent is applied. If the detergent is unsatisfactory or improperly used, the process may not work effectively. Ensure the detergent is appropriate for its intended use and has been properly pre-treated. If any creams, grease, or excessive residues are present, the results can be impacted negatively. The selection of products should be appropriate, and it is essential to rinse thoroughly. If residue remains visible, these may be insoluble and require careful handling when selecting the right product.

**Emergency Emptying Procedure**  
To perform an emergency emptying operation when frost is present, follow these steps: Disconnect the hose from the unit carefully. **Warning!** Switch off the appliance before proceeding to avoid scalding. Let the unit cool down before performing the tasks. Use the collection container to catch fluids as you detach the emptying hose by turning it counterclockwise. Once the process is complete, securely reconnect the emptying hose by turning it clockwise.

**Maintenance Instructions**  
Maintenance is limited primarily to the cover of the unit. Should a malfunction occur, please refer to customer support for guidance, including resetting or washing the components. To maintain the cover, follow these steps: **Warning!** Turn off the appliance and clean the area surrounding the cover. Unscrew it in a counterclockwise manner and detach it from the housing. Reattach the cover by aligning it appropriately and twisting it back securely.

**Additional Settings (RINSE+/SPLEN+/RINCAGE+)**  
For optimal results with fabrics such as Cottons/Linens, Easy-Cares, and Delicates, use the RINSE+ function. Selecting this will enhance the performance of various wash cycles like Pre-Wash and Quick Wash. The lights indicative of RINSE+ should illuminate as a confirmation.

**Child Lock Feature**  
Ensure the child safety lock is engaged before starting the unit to prevent accidental operation by children. The lock must be turned clockwise to activate it appropriately.

**Safety and Compliance**  
Ensure all installations meet the required specifications as shown on the rating plate. The appliance should be connected correctly to the power supply, as outlined in the guidelines. For any uncertainties, contact customer service for assistance.

**Transporting the Unit**  
When transporting the unit, do not attempt to lift it by any external parts like the hoses or covers; use the designated trolley for safety.

**Proper Hose Connection and Care**  
Ensure that the hoses are connected without twists or kinks to prevent flow obstructions. The water inflow hose must be securely attached to function correctly, and pay attention to avoid pinching.

**Water Drainage Instructions**  
Keep the drainage hose clear to prevent overflow and connect it properly to avoid leaks. If you require assistance, reach out to customer service.

**Contacting Customer Service**  
For any issues or further information regarding warranty or servicing, please refer to the rating plate for proper identification details.
