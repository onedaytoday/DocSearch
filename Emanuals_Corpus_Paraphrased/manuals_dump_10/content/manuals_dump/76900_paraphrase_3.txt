The installation of recessed fountains requires unplated water supply tubing as necessary. Ensure all connections to the unplated water cooler are secure, including the shut-off valve. Remove any burrs from the connections before they are assembled. **IMPORTANT:** Avoid soldering tubes that are inserted into the strainer, as this could damage the O-rings.

For grounding, ensure proper electrical isolation of devices such as computers to prevent electrolysis, which can lead to operational issues. The fountain's grounding should be detached from the building's system. Maintain adequate clearance for smooth operation.

The water cooler is pre-set to a temperature of 50Â°F and should be maintained accordingly, using a suitable cleaning agent with a protector. Lubrication is required for the actuation mechanism, utilizing lead-free materials to ensure proper functioning.

**INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE, AND TROUBLESHOOTING MANUAL**: 
Installer instructions emphasize the significance of following the wiring diagram for models ECP8*1D, *2D, *3D. Quick connect fittings should be securely attached by pushing the tube in; to release, push the tube in before pulling it out.
