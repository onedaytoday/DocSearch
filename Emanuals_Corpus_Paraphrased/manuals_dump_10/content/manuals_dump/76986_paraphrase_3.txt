### MAN-OCSIG DC Specifications

The DC power supply aligns with technical specifications outlined by EN60950 or relevant directives, endorsing compliance for categorization. If AC is utilized (via isolated pathways), protective measures need to be implemented in accordance with EN60742. The DC supply is recommended as a single-phase rectified output, adhering to certain criteria: it should be appropriately placed relative to the amplifier and minimize distance to the load (including considerations of inertia). 

### MAN-OCSIG Heat Management

Heat generated within the assembly must be effectively managed. Thermal resistance is characterized in degrees Celsius per Watt (C/W), with the ability to reach shut-off temperatures noted. Charitable time is given for thermal equilibrium. Thermal characteristics are graphically represented below with respect to load and power settings.

### MAN-OCSRIG Motor Connections

The system requires connections to DC motors via the J1 port. Inputs should interface with specified terminals (M2, M3), with a command voltage of 3.75V for operation. If the input exceeds allowable voltage, resistors are to be implemented to ensure compatibility with ECLC and ECLP protocols. The design allows for flexibility within established thresholds for input voltage while maintaining circuitry integrity.

### MAN-OCSRIG Amplifier Specifications

ECLC input connections are provided at J1/9 (ECLC) and output at J1/8 (ECLRET), enabling the amplifier to engage under controlled conditions. Should the voltage across VECLC drop below 3.75V, proper functionality is ensured. The same principles apply to ECLP connections located at J1/14, supporting similar input-output configurations with voltage parameters.

### MAN-OCSRIG Functionality Indicators

Indicators (AOK, SO1, SO2, SO3) provide real-time operational feedback, with specific alerts for short-circuit protection and general amplifier status. User interactions may trigger temporary state changes, impacting output readings.
