Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a natural, technical style while retaining the original meaning:

The heating function allows effective cooking by preheating, typically up to a specified temperature, which promotes better heat distribution. It's advisable to follow the provided cooking chart for optimal results. When using the heating shelf, reduce the temperature by approximately 20-25°C to ensure even cooking, especially when batch cooking items such as baked goods. 

To activate the function, set the thermostat accordingly. The indicator light will illuminate to show that the desired temperature has been reached. Once achieved, the system will alternate between heating and cooling to maintain optimal cooking conditions. Be sure to adjust the thermostat as necessary based on the specific thickness of the food being prepared.

For better heat circulation, arrange food items centrally on the shelves, allowing for even cooking. The system can also cook frozen foods without defrosting, provided the temperature is set between 190-200°C to prevent excessive browning.

The cooking chart includes various dish types, such as cakes, pastries, bread, and meats, along with their recommended preheating protocols. Ensure that chicken or meat is properly cooked to the required temperatures, using a meat thermometer to confirm doneness.

For cleaning, disconnect the electricity supply to allow safe maintenance. Avoid harsh chemicals or bleach that could damage surfaces. Regularly clean the interior and exterior with recommended cleaning agents, ensuring no residue is left that could cause fire hazards. 

Upon completion of cleaning tasks, reassemble any components securely. If the lighting needs replacement, adhere to specified wattage and type to ensure safety. Electrical components should be appropriately earthed to prevent risks, and all installations must comply with specified electrical requirements to avoid breakdowns.
