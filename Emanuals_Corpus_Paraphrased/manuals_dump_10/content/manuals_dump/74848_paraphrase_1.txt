**Maintenance and Troubleshooting Guidelines**

Ensure that the LP gas supply is unobstructed to facilitate proper combustion flow. Components situated below the grates should be cleaned of residue after allowing the unit to cool down. Grates should be cleaned immediately after cooking and turned off, using a cloth for maintenance. If the unit has cooled down, it can also be cleaned with appropriate cleaning solutions to prevent grease build-up, which impacts both performance and appearance.

**Troubleshooting Protocol**  
Inspect the unit regularly, at least once a month, or as needed based on observations. Look for any unusual yellow flames. Ensure that the heat settings are functioning; the indicator light should illuminate when pressed. If it does not heat properly, check for a connection to the power source, and consider replacing the battery if needed. For LP gas users, make sure the gas supply is clear and fully operational.

**Insect Warning**  
Be aware that insects can obstruct the gas flow from the burner. This blockage can potentially lead to fire hazards. Perform routine checks to ensure cleanliness and proper operation, especially in windy conditions.
