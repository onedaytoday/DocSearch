### OWNER’S GUIDE

**IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS**

To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury, follow these essential safety precautions:

- Always turn off the switch and unplug the cleaner during maintenance or when it's not in use.
- Ensure the appliance is kept as a toy away from children.
- Use only recommended attachments and avoid using the vacuum cleaner with damaged cords or when the appliance is damaged.
- Keep cords away from heated surfaces and be aware of their carrying capacity. 
- Allow the appliance to cool down before cleaning or servicing. 
- Maintain a safe distance from burning objects, like matches or ashes, and avoid using the vacuum in environments that may cause burns.

**FOR HOUSEHOLD USE ONLY**

To prevent electric shock, use the appliance only in the recommended manner. If the vacuum overheats, the thermal protector will shut off the suction. Ensure that the vacuum cleaner is unplugged before performing any maintenance tasks, such as clearing blockages.

Read all instructions carefully before using this vacuum cleaner.

### UNPACKING AND CHECKING CONTENTS

Carefully remove all components and accessories from the carton, including the hose, height adjustment mechanism, and upholstery brush.

**CAUTION:** Ensure that the hose is detached before beginning maintenance.

To obtain the best results, always turn off the vacuum before switching between cleaning modes and adjusting the suction power for different surfaces, ensuring you’re using the appropriate setting for carpets, hardwood floors, and upholstery.

### FILTER REPLACEMENT

**DUST BAG**: Replace the S-Bag when the indicator light turns red. When cleaning the dust bag compartment, make sure to securely attach it back to the appliance.

**EXHAUST FILTER**: Replace the exhaust filter when the warning light indicates. Check that both release buttons are functioning correctly upon replacement.

**MOTOR FILTER**: Regularly check and replace the motor filter when it appears dirty.

### MAINTENANCE

To clean the hose, disconnect it and let it cool after use. Remove any blockages and ensure it's clear before reattaching.
