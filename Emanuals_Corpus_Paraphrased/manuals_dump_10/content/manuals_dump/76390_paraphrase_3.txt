### Paraphrased Text

The organization and categorization of laundry involve sorting items based on their type—such as pillowcases, covers, and clothing. This includes separating colored items from whites and treating each group with proper care to maintain their respective qualities, especially the whiteness of whites. New colored items should be washed together initially.

Items such as bathrobes, work shirts, tea shirts, and pajamas should be washed at a temperature of 60°C according to the specified care labels. Synthetics or easy-care fabrics may also be cleaned at this temperature. Delicate items require special handling, and woolen garments should be cleaned only under specific guidelines.

To optimize the cleanliness and appearance of clothes and household linens, it's essential to choose the right detergents. For whites, non-biological detergents like Fairy, may be suitable, while colored fabrics may require detergents formulated to avoid bleach damage. Stains on heavily soiled items can be treated with specialized stain removers such as Vanish or GloWhite, which can be added to the wash.

When using traditional powders or liquids, these should be appropriately measured and added according to the instructions on the packaging. Fabric conditioners can help make easy-care items softer. Follow the manufacturer instructions closely when using these products to ensure optimal performance.

Be aware of the load capacity of your washing machine, as exceeding limits can impact both efficiency and safety. Excessively heavy items, particularly synthetics, can pose fire hazards. 

For drying, various cycles are available, so it's critical to select the right duration based on the fabric type, as outlined in the operating instructions. Initial washing cycles may necessitate a START/PAUSE sequence for proper operation. 

If using the non-stop feature for easy-care fabrics, it's crucial to monitor and manage the operation closely and to utilize the appropriate settings before starting. 

For delayed starts, the selection can be configured to begin after a specified countdown. Indicators will show each phase of operation and whether options like Rinse Hold are activated.

Lastly, during the cleaning cycle, ensure that the cleaning areas, such as the filter and hoses, are checked regularly to remove any buildup. If necessary, disconnect hoses for thorough cleaning and to prevent clogging. In emergencies, such as when the hose is obstructed, follow the manufacturer's instructions to safely drain the machine. Always ensure that proper cleaning methods are applied to maintain both function and safety.

**Troubleshooting Guide**

If error codes appear such as E00, E10, or E20, please follow the outlined troubleshooting steps below. If the appliance does not respond correctly to the instructions or the error codes are displayed, refer to the guidance for issues related to power supply or component connections. 

1. Ensure the **START/PAUSE** button is activated. If the **ON/OFF** button is pressed, confirm it stays engaged. 
2. Check that the door is properly closed; an audible click should be heard (related to E20). 
3. Confirm the appliance is securely connected to the power supply. If **DELAY START** was selected, check that the corresponding options are properly chosen.

If troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, inspect the drainage hose for blockages (indicated by E00) or ensure the entire hose is correctly positioned (as seen in E10). Clean any obstructions found in the hose. 

When using the **RINSE HOLD** option or if selecting **PUMP OUT**, redistribute the laundry evenly inside the drum. Remember to follow the manufacturer guidelines and avoid overloading the machine.

For persistent unsatisfactory performance, such as with stubborn stains, ensure the correct wash settings are applied and consider pre-treating heavily soiled items. 

If additional assistance is required, or for service-related queries, contact the AEG Service Force directly. Ensure to have your model number and purchase details handy for reference.
