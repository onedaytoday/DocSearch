### COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC Functions

The **COOLMATIC** function engages the cooling process, indicated by a yellow light, to maintain the desired temperature of selected items. This function can operate for a designated number of hours based on the initial settings. 

Similarly, the **FROSTMATIC** function is designed to preserve fresh food products and safeguard their quality. It also features a yellow light that signals its activation. If the FROSTMATIC function is turned off manually, it will remain deactivated for a specified time. 

### Appliance Operation and Power Off

Switching the appliance on and off requires pressing both the ON/OFF buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. A countdown will occur, after which the appliance will turn off or on. If power is interrupted, the appliance may automatically revert to its default operational states.

### Defrosting Guidelines

When defrosting, prioritizing the cooling of food is crucial. To maintain food safety, ensure items are stored correctly, and keep the door closed to prevent temperature fluctuations that can lead to spoilage and mold growth. Regularly monitor and clean the interior to maintain optimal performance.

### Storage Solutions

Adjustable shelves are provided to optimize storage space based on the size of food items. For convenience, bottles should be positioned to prevent spills, and ensure that they do not obstruct airflow within the appliance. 

### Temperature Monitoring and Warnings

In case of temperature deviations outside the specified range, a warning indicator will activate. If food is incorrectly stored or the appliance overheats, an acoustic tone will alert the user. The tone can be silenced by pressing the WARNING OFF button. The alarm will automatically mute once the temperature returns to acceptable levels.

### Cleaning Instructions

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply. Use appropriate cleaning products and avoid harsh chemicals that may damage surfaces. Ensure the interior is cleaned regularly and thoroughly to prevent odor buildup and maintain hygiene.

### Correcting Malfunctions

Should any issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting guide for recommended solutions. If problems persist, consult a qualified technician for repairs. Always prioritize safety by disconnecting the appliance from power before attempting any maintenance. 

This guide serves to enhance the understanding of the COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC features while ensuring safe operation and maintenance of the appliance.
