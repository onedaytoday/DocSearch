To ensure a simple and accurate installation, PLEASE REVIEW THESE INSTRUCTIONS THOROUGHLY BEFORE COMMENCING. VERIFY THAT YOUR INSTALLATION MEETS ALL PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL, AND RELATED CODES. It is standard practice to GROUND ELECTRICAL DEVICES, such as phones and computers, to water lines, either within or away from the building. This grounding can lead to electrical feedback in fountains, resulting in electrolytic reactions that may impart a metallic taste or elevate the metal content of the water. This situation can be avoided by utilizing the specified materials. Any drain fittings supplied by the installer should be made of plastic to ensure electrical isolation from the building's plumbing. 

The water supply should be unplated IPS and thoroughly flushed prior to connecting to the fountain. Install the fountain in such a way that it connects to the supply with a shut-off valve. Ensure that any burrs on tubing are removed before installing. DO NOT SOLDER TUBES INSERTED INTO THE STRAINER, AS THIS MAY DAMAGE THE O-RINGS. Product failures arising from improper supply conditions may not be covered under warranty. ALL SERVICE WORK SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT BY A CERTIFIED SERVICE PROFESSIONAL. 

IMPORTANT: INSTALLER PLEASE NOTE â€“ MOUNT THE FOUNTAIN ON A SMOOTH, FINISHED SURFACE. The fountain must be set up with appropriate shut-off water supply connections (provided). CAUTION: Ensure the fountain is rated for the correct PSI; reduce supply PSI if necessary, and ensure compliance with instructions provided in 4595_FTN, 97460C SIB. 

STREAM HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT: If the water supply significantly deviates from factory PSI, adjustments can be made to the items indicated, turning the screw clockwise or counter-clockwise as needed.
