The thawing cabinet is designed to effectively thaw and cook food products, utilizing advanced technology and a thermometer to maintain high quality. The products benefit from a thawing process that results in superior elasticity, moisture retention, and color. This efficient thawing method shortens the defrosting period from hours, preserving the integrity of the food.

The cabinet features a user-friendly design with smooth, rounded corners, simplifying maintenance. It operates by switching from thawing mode to a reduction phase once the food temperature reaches +85Â°C, indicating a bactericidal cleaning function. 

Technical specifications include the D.I.N. capacity for built-in and remote cooling options, mechanical thermostats, and thermometer readings. The cabinet is compatible with GN1/1 baskets and containers, and accessories include trolleys, baskets, and perforated containers, all designed for optimal storage and organization.

The TCR120R and TC18 models are environmentally conscious and comply with HACCP standards.
