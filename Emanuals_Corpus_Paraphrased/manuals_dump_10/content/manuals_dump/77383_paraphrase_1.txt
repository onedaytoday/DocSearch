**Emerson Modulation Overview**

This document outlines the modulation protocols for Emerson Comfort systems, specifically regarding protection for OEM applications. For VDC capacity information, refer to AE8-1328, which covers both OEM and retrofit installations. Note that the Emerson Comfort units are typically designed to operate without additional information as referenced in AE8-1393. 

**Testing and Operation Guidelines**

These guidelines emphasize the importance of application tests, particularly under various operating conditions. A sight tube should be installed to monitor typical operating ranges. If performance does not meet expectations, further research and application alignment will be required with Emerson support.

**Digital Compressor Retrofit Applications**

There are several advantages to retrofitting building systems, including reduced operating costs and improved cooling capacity. Be aware of potential warranty implications from any modifications. The necessary operational parameters should also be examined to ensure compatibility with systems involving reheat or heat recovery.

In undertaking retrofits, it’s essential to leverage advanced software tools for performance prediction, adhering to AHRI standards. All OEM specifications provided by Emerson must be followed, including reference documentation for installation and operation.

**Charge Recovery Procedures**

During charge recovery and system change-out, focus on ensuring accurate measurements of suction and charge levels. It is imperative to confirm a complete charge recovery from the system to maintain optimal performance.

**Service Protocols**

For troubleshooting modulation issues, consult the provided flowcharts for guidance. Ensure that all systems are sufficiently cooled to avoid damage during service. Follow specified steps for pressure checks and confirm that all connections are secure to maintain operational integrity.

**Final Notes**

The document also advises on assembly line procedures to ensure proper component installation and system functionality. Throughout the maintenance and operational processes, it is critical to adhere to Emerson’s published parameters and protocols to achieve maximal performance.
