### Model RH30WC55GSB & RH36WC55GSB Installation Instructions

Thank you for choosing our product. For assistance throughout your purchase and installation processes, please refer to the information provided.

For installation details, including mounting locations, ductwork options, and necessary tools, consult the included instructional materials. Any installation should comply with local codes and regulations. 

**Warning:** Before beginning installation, ensure all electrical services are turned off to prevent risk of death or injury. Proper grounding is essential; ensure any electrical connections follow the guidelines set forth by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the Canadian Standards Association (CSA).

**Important Notes:**
- This system is intended for general ventilation only. Do not use it to exhaust hazardous materials.
- To minimize fire risks, use metal ductwork only. 
- Keep cooking areas clean to reduce the danger of grease fires. If a grease fire occurs, smother flames with a suitable lid and never use water to extinguish it.

**Installation Guidelines:**
1. **Duct Placement:** Ensure ductwork is installed straight and as short as possible to enhance airflow. When applicable, allow for thermal expansion in colder climates.
2. **Mounting Dimensions:** Verify that the mounting installation aligns with specified height and dimensions. Use appropriate screws and anchors to secure the installation.
3. **Check Alignment:** Before finalizing, confirm that all installations are perpendicular and accurately positioned.
4. **Cover Installation:** Attach the cover to the back, ensuring it fits snugly with the guided screw locations.

For detailed installation steps, warnings, and product specifications, please refer to the full set of instructions provided with your unit. If further assistance is necessary, you may contact customer service via our website or directly at the provided toll-free number.

### Warranty Information
Please retain these instructions for warranty validation and future reference.

**Paraphrase:**

To determine screw positions, refer to the template provided, which indicates the minimum necessary locations for the top mounting of the cleats—this is critical. The installation should match the screw locations shown in the round diagram below. Ensure the screws are installed by hand, adhering to the correct positions for both upper and lower screws. 

When connecting ductwork, follow the illustrated directions to ensure an airtight seal, using the assembly screws as specified. Prior to this step, make sure to uninstall any previous assembly screws.

**Warning:** Disconnect the AC power supply before proceeding. This appliance features an electrical junction box with wires, including a green/yellow wire designated for grounding. To prevent electric shock, connect this grounding wire to your home’s electrical grounding system, and never cut or remove it.

If applicable, mount the cover securely at the top using the provided assembly screws. Ensure the cover is properly greased and serviced.

**Functions of the Blower and Light:**
The light functions can be controlled with the ON/OFF switch. Press to turn ON the light or press again to turn it OFF. The countdown timer is initiated if there is no action within several seconds.

Operational functions include increasing or decreasing settings via the buttons within a specified timeframe. The clock functionality is indicated through various buttons, allowing users to set hours and seconds.

Keep the grease filter functional for up to thirty hours; it can be washed or replaced as needed. Charcoal filters can be activated or deactivated similarly and should be cleaned or replaced regularly.

Maintain the blower's operation during cooking to reduce smoke and grease effectively. It should be operated continuously while cooking and turned on intermittently for cleaning. 

Service the grease filter at least once a month; it can be cleaned or placed in a dishwasher for thorough cleaning. 

**Note:** Always turn off the lights before servicing. Ensure all lights are functioning correctly after any maintenance. Use suitable household cleaning products for maintenance tasks, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces.
