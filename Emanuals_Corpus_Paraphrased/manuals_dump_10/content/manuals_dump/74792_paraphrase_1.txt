To activate the H function, hold down the C button continuously until it reaches +8C. This function can exhibit slight abnormalities if the appliance is malfunctioning — often due to improper contact, so check if the appliance is operating at the lowest settings for optimal storage of food items. Ensure food is placed correctly, with sufficient space to avoid blocking air circulation and maintain proper cooling. Adjust the shelf heights as necessary. Should the (F) indicator light illuminate, press the C button for a few seconds until the counting starts from the point it turns off.

For any persistent issues, please contact AEG Service Force for technical breakdowns. The cleaning instructions in the manual should be executed properly to avoid hazards like electric shocks. Ensure to disconnect the appliance during cleaning, and always use suitable commercial cleaning agents. Warning: Do not expose the appliance to water while it's plugged in. For defrosting, turn off the cleaning switch and use a cloth for maintenance.

If the FROSTMATIC function is enabled, it highlights the function with a yellow indicator. To adjust cooling, refer to the indicator lights for actual versus desired temperatures, and keep food separated and covered properly. Follow the suggestions for storing foods at optimal temperatures to prevent spoilage.

For ice cube preparation, ensure the water has enough time to freeze without exceeding the maximum capacity of the tray. When necessary, allow foods to cool before placing them in the freezer to prevent frost buildup. Avoid storing drinks in glass containers to prevent explosions due to pressure changes.

Follow prescribed guidelines for loading foods into the freezer, ensuring items do not interfere with proper air circulation, which can lead to inefficiencies or malfunctions. Keep an eye on the first-time usage recommendations and perform regular maintenance to sustain optimal performance.

### FROSTMATIC Function Overview

The FROSTMATIC function is indicated by a yellow light, which activates after several hours of operation. This feature helps protect the freshness of food during freezing. If manually switched off, the FROSTMATIC function can be deactivated to prevent overcooling, particularly if frost accumulates excessively. Frost thickness should be monitored, and when it becomes too thick, the thermostat should be adjusted to prevent buildup.

### Defrosting Procedure

After defrosting, the frost can be removed by taking food out and using newspaper for insulation. It's essential to turn off the appliance during this time to allow for proper cleaning and maintenance. A warning light will flash when the defrosting function is active, and an audible alert may accompany it. 

### Cleaning Guidelines

Regular cleaning is crucial for optimal appliance performance. Use a cloth and commercial cleaning products as needed. Ensure to avoid electric shock by disconnecting the power supply before cleaning. The interior and shelves should be wiped down, and any frost buildup on the back should be managed by following proper cleaning procedures.

### Troubleshooting
