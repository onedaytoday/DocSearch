**Operational Isolation and Maintenance Instructions**

Begin by isolating the operation from the supply. Ensure that the supply switching is performed appropriately. Disconnect the power supply before any maintenance procedure. Always remove and clean the suction system, which should be correctly attached to prevent any efficiency loss.

It is important to regularly clean the grease filters—preferably every four hours if used frequently. Depending on your model, these filters should either be washed in a dishwasher at a minimum temperature of 65°C or cleaned manually using appropriate grease cleaners.

For maintenance, the charcoal filters also require attention. They should be detailed and reactivated monthly to optimize their performance, generally lasting around three years before needing replacement. Ensure you follow the instructions provided on the rating plate and prioritize safety when handling any electric equipment or performing maintenance tasks.

In case of appliance malfunctions, ensure it is connected to a functioning power supply and that the proper settings are selected. If issues persist, consult the service manual or a professional technician. Always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply when performing repairs or installations.

Whenever installing or assembling components such as brackets or suction systems, adhere strictly to the provided templates and guides to guarantee secure and effective operation.
