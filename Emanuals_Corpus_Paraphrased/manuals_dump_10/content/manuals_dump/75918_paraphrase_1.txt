**OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS**

**CONTROLS**
The refrigerator operates with V or LP gas, managed through the designated switches. The thermostat allows for temperature regulation. Light indicators will inform you of the refrigerator's operational status.

**STARTING THE REFRIGERATOR**
Before initiating LP gas service, ensure that the gas bottle is properly connected and the supply is turned on. To start the refrigerator:
1. Activate the power switch (D).
2. Set the thermostat (E) to its highest level.
3. The light indicator should flash, confirming activation. 

**WINTER OPERATION**
For optimal performance in winter conditions (below 10°C), utilize the available winter covers to enhance cooling efficiency.

**REGULATING THE TEMPERATURE**
Allow several hours for the refrigerator to reach optimal operating conditions. Adjust the thermostat as necessary to maintain the desired temperature. The thermostat should be continuously monitored.

**TRAVEL CATCH**
Ensure the travel catch is securely positioned to prevent movement during transit. This will enhance efficiency and cooling performance.

**FOOD STORAGE**
Store food properly to maintain optimal freshness, ensuring items are sealed to prevent spoilage. Be cautious of items that may burst if frozen directly.

**ICE MAKING**
Ensure the cooling element is adequately set to achieve effective ice production. The ice tray should remain in an appropriate cooling location.

**DEFROSTING**
Regularly check for ice buildup, as excessive frost can hinder performance. Turn the refrigerator off to defrost when frost exceeds 5mm in thickness. Collect melted water with a cloth and avoid leaving food items inside during this process.

**CLEANING THE REFRIGERATOR**
Utilize a damp cloth and a mild cleaning solution to wipe down surfaces. Avoid abrasive cleaners, and ensure that the interior is cleaned thoroughly.

**TURNING OFF THE REFRIGERATOR**
To safely shut down the refrigerator:
1. Turn off the power supply using switch (D).
2. Ensure the interior is emptied and defrosted, especially during winter storage.

**IF THE FRIDGE FAILS TO WORK**
Check the following:
- Ensure all instructions have been followed accurately.
- Verify that the power supply and gas connection are intact.
- Confirm that the gas bottle is not empty.

**MAINTENANCE**
Regularly check the unit for wear and tear, adhering to guidelines outlined in G607 of DVGW for authorized service recommendations.

**SOME USEFUL HINTS**
To ensure proper operation, defrost regularly and store items efficiently to enhance performance.

**GUARANTEE AND SERVICE**
For customer support, refer to the service manual or contact your local service provider.

**TECHNICAL DATA**
Specifications regarding height, capacity, and cooling mechanisms are detailed further in the manual.

**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**
To reposition the hinges, follow the specific steps for disassembly and reassembly carefully, ensuring all components are secure.

**DOOR PANEL**
Installation of the door panel can be executed easily by following the designated instructions for alignment and adjustment.

### BUILDING-IN

The relationship between the heat radiated from the cooker and the thermal performance of the vehicle is crucial, especially when the cooker lacks a heat shield. For optimal performance, the vehicle should generally face south to manage the heat and combustion effectively. If not adequately covered, this configuration can diminish cooling efficiency and overall performance.

### TECHNICAL DATA

Installation must account for the position of the cooker and ensure that its components are secure. The fasteners should withstand the forces experienced during vehicle operation. Adequate clearance between components is essential; modifications may be necessary to fit properly. Additionally, quality insulation (e.g., polyurethane) might be required to enhance performance.

### VENTILATION OF THE UNIT

It is vital to ensure proper ventilation at high operational levels. Air must circulate effectively through and around the unit to maintain optimal temperatures, ideally reaching at least 20°C as indicated. Clearances around the unit should facilitate maintenance and inspection without obstruction.

### GAS CONNECTIONS

When operating on LP gas, verifying the supply pressure is crucial. The connection must adhere to safety standards, avoiding push-on fittings and ensuring compatibility with the continuous operating requirements. The LP gas supply should connect securely to the designated coupling, with care given to maintaining a seal and ensuring proper servicing access.

### ELECTRICAL CONNECTION

Electrical installations must comply with I.E.E. regulations, employing appropriate connectors and ensuring proper earthing. The wiring should be color-coded: green-and-yellow for earth, blue for neutral, and brown for live. All connections should follow the appropriate terminal guidelines, ensuring that the appliance is adequately grounded.

### INSTALLATION GUIDELINES

For satisfactory operation, ensure that connections are correctly routed and adhere to the specified ratings. Wiring adjustments may be required during installation. The system, including the battery, should have strategic connections to maintain functionality while the vehicle is in operation.
