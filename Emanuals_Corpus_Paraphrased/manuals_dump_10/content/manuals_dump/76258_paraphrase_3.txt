Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

To initiate the washing cycle, press the START/PAUSE button. Upon doing so, the display will indicate the selected cycle, showing the PRE WASH, RINSE, and RINSE+ phases which will blink. Ensure that the door is securely closed, then press START/PAUSE again. The timer will count down hours remaining for the entire cycle, which will be displayed. If you need to modify settings during the countdown, you can press the START/PAUSE or the DELAY TIMER buttons as necessary; the new selections will be displayed accordingly.

If RINSE HOLD is activated, the indicator will blink when the START/PAUSE button is pressed. To cancel or change settings, turn the appliance to OFF and then select DRAIN, SPIN, or SHORT SPIN options as needed. For the EASY IRON mode, it will engage an anti-crease phase that concludes with a notification on the display. 

If OVERDOSING is detected, the system will halt the cycle automatically. The appliance is designed for various care types including Easy-Cares, Wool/Silk, and Cold Wash, optimized for effective washing at temperatures no less than 40°C to avoid creasing in fabrics. 

For cleaning and maintenance, the surface can be wiped with a damp cloth, ensuring the outer casing is free of harsh cleaning agents. When troubleshooting, verify correct setup, and if issues arise such as error codes C1 or C2, consult the AEG Service Force for resolution. If the PRE WASH or other cycles do not function correctly, check water supply issues or other obstructions, ensuring hoses are securely connected and not blocked.

In case of emergency emptying, follow safety protocols: allow the appliance to cool down before handling, ensure proper drainage, and execute tasks cautiously. For various program adjustments, refer to the user manual for specific instructions on activating features like RINSE+ or cooling functions tailored for specific fabrics.

Lastly, keep in mind that settings may affect washing performance; ensure you’re adhering to fabric care labels for optimal results.
