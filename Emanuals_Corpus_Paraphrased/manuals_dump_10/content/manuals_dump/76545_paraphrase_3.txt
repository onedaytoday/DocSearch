The other head screws into the right side of the front section. It is important to ensure proper earthing and testing. The system operates on a three-phase supply. Proper protective measures must be in place, including a rated Residual Current Device (RCD) to safeguard against electric shock. The setup should prevent overheating and adhere to specific technical specifications. 

Correct rotation direction is essential; wiring or the outlet connection must be verified to avoid incorrect assembly. If the motor runs counterclockwise instead of clockwise, this indicates incorrect alignment that needs immediate correction. 

The device should always be switched off during maintenance or repairs. A clockwise turn is needed for the head screw (note: it's a left-hand thread), and cleaning must not interfere with operational efficiency. Precautions must be taken to avoid inhaling debris, and equipment operation should comply with specified sound protection limits, as indicated by the relevant standards.

Instructions in English and other languages cover installation, operation, and safety precautions. Regular maintenance and monitoring for wear are vital to ensure optimal performance. If ignited materials or excessive heat are a concern, follow specified operational guidelines and wear appropriate protective equipment.
