The software begins by selecting a warmer setting, either for initial use or based on current adjustments. Once the desired warmer setting is chosen, it temporarily displays the adjustment. Preheating may occur while utilizing the warmer option. The Luxury-Lighting feature provides theater-style lighting that illuminates the warmer at varying brightness levels. Lights are activated whenever the warmer is in use, following the defined cleaning protocols.

It is crucial to handle hot cookware carefully to avoid burns, particularly when using offset racks. The offset rack height provides options for food placement, accommodating different dish sizes and allowing proper heat distribution around the cookware. 

When removing items, ensure they are cool enough to handle and follow proper procedures to avoid any injury. Different types of cookware can affect the cooking process; heat distribution varies based on the cookware's design. Do not obstruct any vents during use, especially during canning processes, and adhere strictly to USDA guidelines.

For precise cooking tasks, functionality includes various heat settings ranging from 170°F (76°C) to 550°F (288°C). The preheat function should be initiated based on the selected cooking features, with a clear process to cancel or make adjustments during cooking if necessary.

The convection cooking feature allows for even heat distribution, and users need to follow careful guidelines for adjusting cooking times and temperatures. Should a fire occur, do not use water; instead, employ appropriate fire extinguishing methods.

Lastly, using convection can enhance cooking performance and efficiency. Always refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for best results and to ensure safety during operations.

The option allows you to utilize the Convection Bake setting for enhanced cooking performance of various food items. It is essential to monitor the recommended cooking times and ensure that food is heated evenly. Note that you can cancel the cooking process at any point. 

To initiate the Convection Bake function at 350°F (176°C), press UPPER OVEN, then CONV BAKE, and subsequently START. Once the display indicates PRE-HEATING, wait until it completes to start cooking. If needed, you may also select UPPER or WARMER options for different food items.

For effective Convection Roasting, utilize a roasting pan that captures grease, which aids in cooking by circulating heated air around the food. This method helps minimize browning issues particularly for poultry and meats while enhancing overall cooking results.

Be aware of food safety protocols to prevent food poisoning; always cook food to the recommended temperatures. You can stop the cooking process anytime if necessary.

For Slow Cooking, select the UPPER option and press SLOW COOK to choose your desired setting and temperature, ensuring food is thawed completely before cooking.

When dehydrating foods, select UPPER OVEN, then DEHYDRATE, to allow the heat to circulate around the foods evenly. Ensure proper air circulation by using appropriate covers.

For proofing yeast-based products, set the oven to the BREAD PROOF function at the desired low temperature to maintain an ideal environment for the dough to rise.

If managing cooking instructions, select UPPER OVEN and MY FAVORITE to access or overwrite existing settings quickly.

In terms of the warmer feature, it is designed to keep cooked foods at optimal temperatures. It is critical to keep children away from the lower oven area when it is in use to avoid burns. Additionally, do not line the oven drawer or racks with foil to ensure safety and efficiency.

Always follow food heating guidelines to prevent foodborne illnesses and maintain proper food safety. When using the warmer feature, ensure food is kept above 170°F to minimize health risks.

**Warmer Settings and Cleaning Instructions**

To set the warmer to 190°F (88°C), press the WARMER OVEN button followed by the KEEP WARM button. Then, press START to adjust the temperature to 190°F. You may CANCEL the operation at any time during the cooking or warming process. For cleaning, allow the warmer to cool before addressing any food residues or build-up. Cover dishes with heatproof materials during warming, and refrain from using any cleaners that could damage the oven's interior.

### Preferences and Settings

For adjusting preferences on the appliance, follow these steps: Press USER PREF to navigate through your options. You can increase or decrease settings and press START to confirm your selection. To reset preferences, simply press CANCEL while the oven is operating, or adjust the clock settings (CLO) by selecting the appropriate options until you reach your desired setting. You can toggle the clock on or off as needed.

### Temperature Preferences

The factory settings for the temperature preferences can be modified to accommodate different cooking needs. You can adjust temperature offsets by entering values between +35°F (+19°C) and -35°F (-19°C). Use USER PREF to access these options and confirm with START or cancel as necessary.

### Self-Cleaning Mode

The self-cleaning feature operates at a high temperature to effectively reduce food residues and stains. Before initiating the self-clean cycle, remove racks and clean the oven cavity with a damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals on the self-cleaning interior. After the cycle, the oven will be extremely hot; ensure proper ventilation. 

### Cleaning Instructions

For the exterior and decorative components, follow specific cleaning protocols. Use a damp cloth for stainless steel and enamel, avoiding abrasive materials that may scratch surfaces. For any grease build-up, a suitable cleaner can be applied, but ensure to test on a discreet area first.

#### Maintenance of Cooktop

Ensure the cooktop is completely cool before cleaning. Follow the specific guidance for maintaining the heating elements and use the appropriate tools to avoid damaging the surfaces.
