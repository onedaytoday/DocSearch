To ensure effective heat circulation around cookware and food, it's crucial to provide adequate space between items and the cavity's back. This allows heat to envelop the food evenly. When serving, ensure that food items are adequately arranged to facilitate light penetration and cooking efficiency. Use proper covers to maintain food quality. Always utilize potholders or protective gear to prevent burns when handling cookware or plates.

For optimal cooking, select recommended settings based on the type of food. For example, use the MED setting for various meats and HI for poultry. Monitor the cooking process closely, adjusting settings as needed. Preheating ensures even cooking; follow instructions meticulously for best results.

Avoid overcrowding the cookware, as this can lead to uneven cooking and excessive heat buildup. Adjust temperature settings to stay within the recommended range for different food types, taking note of potential higher temperature requirements for meats.

During self-cleaning cycles, ensure the appliance is well-ventilated, and avoid using external cleaning agents or protective coatings that may interfere with effectiveness. Follow specific guidelines for cleaning internal components without causing damage.

For safety and optimal performance, keep all surfaces—including grates and stovetops—cleaned regularly and avoid the ingress of spills or cleaning agents into sensitive areas. Remember to use appropriate cloths for maintenance and avoid aggressive scrubbing that could harm finishes.

### Paraphrased Text:

To correctly install the bearings at the front of the chassis, ensure each bearing clicks into place. You will hear a click indicating the bearing is seated properly. Turn off the self-cleaning function before servicing. Note that failure to do so may lead to serious injury. Always maintain the glass shield in place during operation to ensure safety.

For cleaning, make sure the oven is cool. Use leather gloves for protection when handling the shield. If the appliance shows an error code (like F11), it could indicate installation issues or problems with tightly spaced components. It's important to address these promptly by consulting an authorized servicer.

When cleaning, check the grates and burners to ensure they are not clogged and that the gas supply is fully opened. Also, make sure to follow the cleaning instructions precisely. Allow the oven to preheat correctly and monitor the food to avoid overheating and burning.
