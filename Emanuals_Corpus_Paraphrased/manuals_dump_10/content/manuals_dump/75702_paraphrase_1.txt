**Technical Overview of 20GN1/1 Chilling System**

The 20GN1/1 chilling system effectively reduces the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly curtailing bacterial growth. This chilling process adheres to NF and UK regulations, providing different operational modes, including Soft Chilling at 2°C and standard chilling to -18°C for food preservation without compromising quality. 

Built-in features include a UV light as an accessory and a countdown display for monitoring service information. The system can operate continuously, capturing data for HACCP compliance, particularly in cases of abnormal terminations. 

Performance metrics indicate that food can be chilled from +90°C to +3°C within four hours, complying with nutritional standards and regulations.
