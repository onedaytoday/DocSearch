The cold storage solution features coolers operating at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C, designed with varying thicknesses and options for built-in or external components. This system includes four configurations tailored for pre-charged cooling and requires construction knowledge for installation. The use of a new injection technique enhances performance and ensures high quality, complemented by pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free from CFCs and HCFCs. 

The design includes rounded internal corners for improved hygiene. The fast-fit feature enables efficient assembly, and the PVC components ensure airtight sealing. The unit can operate under high ambient conditions (up to +43°C) and is compatible with refrigerants R404A and R134A. Defrosting is managed via heated elements to mitigate ice build-up, while internal lighting (rated IP54) is integrated.

Key functionalities include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat. The door is right-hinged and equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, promoting airtightness and effective insulation, which helps reduce energy costs. All components conform to HACCP standards.
