Fabric conditioners are useful for reducing wrinkles and easing care. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for use alongside laundry loads, especially for easy-care fabrics.

**Warnings for Laundering**  
Be cautious with synthetic or flammable materials. Ensure items are sorted correctly to prevent mishaps. 

**Drying Instructions**  
Select the appropriate drying cycle based on fabric type. Monitor the drying process via the indicator lights. If using Rinse Hold, observe the designated lights to manage completion.

**Emergency Protocols**  
In cases of blockage or malfunction, follow the specified steps to address issues and reset the machine as required. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Regular cleaning of the machine is essential. Areas such as the recess and filter should be cleaned to prevent obstructions. Additionally, ensure hoses are properly attached and free from blockages.

If error codes are displayed (e.g., E10, E20), review the specific issue and follow the corrective actions outlined in the manual. Properly closing doors and ensuring connections are secure is crucial.
