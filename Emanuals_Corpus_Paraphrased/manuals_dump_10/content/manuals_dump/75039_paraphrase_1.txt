**Toast Preheating and Cleaning Instructions**

Before beginning any cleaning tasks, ensure that the electricity supply is turned off and the appliance has cooled down. Cleaning tasks should be performed using appropriate materials to prevent any buildup that may pose a fire hazard. Make sure to disconnect the appliance from the power source before starting. 

For cleaning, a household cleaner or bleach can be used, but avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the finishes. It is advisable to use a non-invasive cleaner such as Brite if significant staining occurs. When cleaning the cavity, use a soft cloth to ensure a thorough clean; avoid harsh scraping or abrasive pads.

To facilitate the cleaning process, follow these steps:
1. Set the cooking function to the recommended temperature and allow the cavity to heat for about an hour if no food is present. This aids in the breakdown of splatters.
2. While the cavity is hot, clean the surfaces with a cloth carefully without risking burns.
3. Make sure to maintain a regular cleaning schedule to prevent significant buildup, as this can impact appliance performance.

For shelf supports and other catalytic components:
1. Once the appliance is completely cool, remove the front screw while stabilizing the shelf with one hand.
2. Clean shelves with only mild detergents, and avoid dishwashers unless specified.
3. For any assembly, ensure that everything is secured tightly and make sure to check for proper fit.

If any component shows signs of wear or potential shattering, consult with an authorized service provider for advice. This is crucial, as attempting repairs or replacements without expertise may void warranties.
