### Travel Announcement (TA) / Travel Program Identification (TP) Functions

To activate the TA function, press the TA button once. Pressing the TA button again will deactivate the TA function. When the TA function is active, it searches for relevant traffic information. If available, it will switch to TP information for further searches. Without TA information, it defaults to TP. In scenarios where TP and TA information are both received, it will prioritize specific sources like CD, SD, USB, or AUX. Once TA information has been processed, it reverts to previous settings. The AS/PS (Auto Store/Presets Scan) functionalities are also locked during this process.

For PTY (Program Type) searches, press PTY to begin. To select a specific PTY type, you can use the buttons provided. If the LCD displays "NOT FOUND" during a PTY search, the operation may need to be retried.
