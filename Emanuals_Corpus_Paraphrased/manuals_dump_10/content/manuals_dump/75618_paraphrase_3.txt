### Common Issues
#### Before Contacting Support
If you experience issues with cooling or other functionalities, examine the following:
- Ensure the appliance is plugged in and the outlet is operational.
- Check if any circuit breakers have tripped.
- Look for signs of wear or damage in the seals or components.
