**Self-Contained ELK-45 Overview**

The ELK-45 features a self-contained, aesthetically pleasing housing. This system can produce sounds based on input options for both burglary and fire alerts. It has a built-in capability that allows the overall sound output to be adjusted to lower levels. The device supports U-shaped mounting, making it suitable for installation on soffits and other locations similar to the ELK-150RT, which is designed for compact mounting. This unit is pre-wired for ease of installation and comes with a warranty.

**Installation Instructions**

To install the ELK-45, align it with the threads of the mounting holes in the housing. Attach the provided screws and washers, ensuring the black wire is connected correctly. Note that the factory settings allow for a current draw of approximately XX Amps. After connecting to the circuit board, refer to the instructions for specific locations to connect the wires. The ELK-45 has two modes: STEADY BURG for burglary alerts and PULSING FIRE for fire alerts, which can be controlled via the designated switch connections.
