### Technical Paraphrase

**Water Heater Applications: Cold Water Supply and Optional Configuration**

This water heater features a flow switch for cold water mixing, which regulates the flow rate (GPM) based on the system’s head pressure and the heater's power output (over 85W). When installed, the water heater must operate at 10°F (5°C) below the specified inlet temperature. The system includes integrated shut-off mechanisms for maintenance, compatible with 120VAC systems equipped with L6006A or L6006C components. The flow switch activates when GPM reaches a designated threshold, preventing potential overheating and scalding risks. The heating function operates only when cold water is supplied.

### Caution and Warnings

Be aware of interference that may affect performance. Disconnect the power supply before making any connections. Ensure that the remote cord is properly connected to the unit, observing the color-coded wiring (e.g., black to black, white to white).

### Installation Guidelines

Drill two 0.5-inch oblong holes for fitting installation, maintaining specified heights from the bottom of the case. Connections to the condensate drain, hot water outlet, cold water inlet, and gas inlet should follow the provided schematic. Properly secure all wiring through designated thoroughfares.

### Wall Anchor Installation

Properly locate and install wall anchors to prevent exposure to sunlight and ensure stability during usage. Ensure that cord lengths are adequate and that all wires are correctly secured to the wall anchor for optimal operation.
