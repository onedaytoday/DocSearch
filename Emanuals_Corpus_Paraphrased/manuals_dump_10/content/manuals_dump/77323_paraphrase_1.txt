---

Ensure that the LCD is properly aligned as shown. To correctly seat the LCD, refer to the chapters and press as indicated. It is crucial to follow the callouts and instructions on the back of the LCD. 

Ensure that three screws secure the LCD, with the top part seated first. Be attentive to not trap any components during installation. 

When reassembling, begin with the CPU. Carefully place the CPU into its socket, using the locking screw to secure it clockwise. Apply thermal grease as specified—preferably GP50 or XR-PE—after cleaning the CPU surface with a lint-free cloth. Distribute the thermal grease evenly across the CPU.

Assemble the TouchPad Bracket, first securing the TouchPad itself, followed by connecting the FFC as indicated. Check the seating of the components to avoid issues.

Proceed with installing the Right Cover, ensuring that it is properly aligned and secured. Once positioned correctly, press around the edges to secure it with screws, repeating for the front Cover.

Install the HDD by aligning it as shown, making sure to connect it according to the arrow guides. Ensure that the WLAN card is also seated properly.

For the ODD, follow similar steps to ensure it fits correctly and is secured with screws. 

Apply pressure around the peripheries to check alignment, and secure the covers with the necessary screws.

If troubleshooting is required, refer to the symptoms provided. For issues such as shutdowns, ensure components are connected correctly and check for any protectors interfering. If the LCD malfunctions or displays abnormally, it might need replacement. 

Perform a POST check for further diagnostics if relevant lights are not showing. Ensure memory modules are reseated as necessary and confirm BIOS settings if hardware conflicts arise. 

If sound issues occur, verify that audio settings are configured correctly and that no devices are muted. Similarly, check microphone settings to ensure functionality.

For HDD issues, confirm the drive is connected properly and utilize recovery software if needed. Follow BIOS instructions to ensure all components are recognized effectively.

### Optical Disk Drive (ODD) Troubleshooting

If the Optical Disk Drive (ODD) does not function correctly, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Access Devices**: Check the ODD's connection and operation status via BIOS. Look for any LED indicators.

2. **Device Manager**:
   - Double-click on the **ATA/ATAPI Controllers** to expand the section.
   - For DVD/CD-ROM drives, right-click and check if the items listed are functioning correctly.
   - Ensure that the ODD is properly seated and free from scratches.

3. **Playback Issues**: 
   - If playback is choppy, try closing unnecessary applications. This can help free up resources for smoother playback.
   - Confirm the software being used for burning is compatible and not from a factory reset state.

4. **Settings**: 
   - Right-click on **IDE ATA/ATAPI** and select **Advanced Settings** to ensure that DMA is enabled for optimal performance.

5. **BIOS Check**: 
   - If the ODD is not detected, restart the system and enter BIOS (usually pressing F2 during startup) to see if it recognizes the drive.
   - Inspect the physical connections to the motherboard and reseat the drive if necessary.

6. **Wireless Functionality**: 
   - If wireless components are malfunctioning, check the Thermal Unit and ensure the connections are secure.

7. **Diagnostic Tools**: Identify potential hardware issues by isolating components. Check for conflicts with other devices, such as the CRT switch, LAN interfaces, or additional cards.

8. **Memory Initialization**: 
   - During system boot, the BIOS conducts POST (Power-On Self-Test), which includes memory checks such as DRAM initialization and cache configurations.
   - Pay attention to any errors related to memory timing (e.g., CAS latency).

9. **Peripheral Connection**: Review all connectors including USB, SATA, and audio to ensure they are properly established.

10. **Clearing BIOS/Recovery**: 
   - If issues persist, you may need to clear the BIOS settings for recovery. This involves temporarily removing the RTC battery and activating the Clear CMOS jumper (R379).

By following these steps thoroughly, you can diagnose and potentially resolve issues with your ODD and system performance effectively.

### BIOS Recovery Process

The Crisis BIOS Recovery feature allows users to restore BIOS firmware to a previous version if issues arise during the BIOS flashing process. To utilize this function effectively, it's advisable to connect your device to both AC power and a charged battery. Activate the BIOS Recovery by pressing the designated hotkey during the BIOS POST phase. 

To execute a BIOS recovery from a USB drive, you will need to create a Crisis USB. This involves copying the appropriate BIOS files onto the USB drive, specifically the BIOS.wph file and the wincris.exe tool. Select the USB drive format option and follow the on-screen instructions. Once the Crisis USB is prepared, turn off the device, connect the USB, then power it on while pressing ESC. The BIOS recovery process should initiate.
