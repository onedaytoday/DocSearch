The refrigeration unit operates between -2/+8°C and features insulated panels with varying thicknesses. It can include built-in cooling systems and is designed for installation with pre-charged cooling assemblies. The unit employs new injection technology to enhance performance, utilizing pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free from CFCs and HCFCs. 

Design elements include rounded corners, facilitating a fast-fit centering system that ensures airtight connections with PVC and other materials. The system is easy to mount and accommodates high ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) while using refrigerants such as R404A across various performance levels.

Defrosting is optimized through the use of heated elements, minimizing ice build-up during operation. Internal lighting, rated IP54, is integrated and controlled via an ON/OFF switch along with a thermostat for efficient functioning. The door is right-hinged, featuring smooth rounded edges, and is constructed to maintain high insulation standards, thereby minimizing energy loss. The system adheres to HACCP guidelines and is compatible with optional accessories.
