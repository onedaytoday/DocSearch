**Earth Continuity Check and Appliance Testing Guidelines**

**Earth Continuity Check:**
1. Ensure the appliance is electrically disconnected. 
2. Check the connections from earth to earth; these should be secure and tighter than the earth wires.
3. Use the Earth Continuity tester to verify the connections. 
4. If readings indicate continuity, proceed to the insulation check.

**Insulation Check:**
1. With the appliance powered off, ensure that all switches are in the ON position.
2. Test the leads for insulation integrity. If the reading indicates any leakage, corrective action is required.
3. Note: if a reading appears infinite, confirm that the test leads are functioning properly.
4. Inspect for any signs of burning or arcing, particularly around terminals, and verify that polarity is correct, ensuring proper connection between 'N', 'O', and 'L' terminals.

**Commissioning Procedure:**
1. Set the supply voltage to maximum and minimum levels, switching between the two.
2. If the light indicator goes out, follow the procedures outlined below.
3. Use a thin screwdriver to adjust the screw located at the crown or base of the appliance, ensuring that it remains steady while adjusting from minimum to maximum.
4. Turn the supply on and conduct a separate supply test. The readings should stabilize.

**Conversion from Natural Gas to LPG:**
1. Ensure that the appliance is turned 'OFF' and disconnected from the electricity supply.
2. Adjust the LPG injectors, using a thin screwdriver to modify the screws as necessary.
3. Confirm that settings align with the appliance’s specifications.

**Important Note:**
Follow all safety instructions and manufacturer guidelines to ensure compliance and safety while operating or servicing the appliance.
