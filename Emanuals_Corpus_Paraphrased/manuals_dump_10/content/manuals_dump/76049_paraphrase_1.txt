### OWNER'S GUIDE: UltraActive

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**  
Before using this vacuum cleaner, please read all instructions carefully. To minimize the risk of fire or electric shock, keep these instructions for household use only. Use a grounded outlet and ensure proper protection against electric shock. This vacuum is equipped with a thermal protector that prevents overheating; if it turns off, switch it back on after addressing the cause of the overheating, which could include obstructions in the hose. If issues persist, contact an Authorized Service Center.

### COMPONENTS AND ACCESSORIES
Check the contents of the carton upon unpacking. Included items are the exhaust filter (EL012B), motor filter (REF), and belt (EL097), all genuine Electrolux parts. Ensure that all components are assembled correctly before use.

### USING THE ULTRAACTIVE FOR THE FIRST TIME
Connect the hose securely by pressing the release buttons to ensure a proper fit. Check that the catch clicks into place. To turn the vacuum on or off, use the ON/OFF switch. Adjust the suction power as needed based on the surface being cleaned.

### GETTING THE BEST RESULTS
For optimal performance, switch off the vacuum when transitioning between different surfaces. The cleaning nozzle height can be adjusted for effective cleaning. Be careful to avoid tangling the cord during use, and if an obstruction occurs, turn off the vacuum immediately.

### EMPTYING AND CLEANING THE DUST CONTAINER
Periodically empty the dust container when it reaches the MAX fill line. To clean, remove the container and rinse thoroughly; ensure it is completely dry before reattaching. The cyclonic filter and foam filter should be cleaned every few months, or sooner if they appear dirty.

### REPLACING FILTERS
When replacing the exhaust filter (EL012B) or motor filter, use only genuine Electrolux filters. Follow the instructions regarding the removal and installation processes.

### MAINTAINING THE HOSE
To keep the hose clean, check for obstructions regularly. Allow the hose to cool down before handling it for cleaning. The warranty does not cover damages caused by improper cleaning.

### REPLACING THE BELT (BELT STYLE EL097)
To replace the belt, allow the vacuum to cool down before beginning service. Remove the screws to access the belt and use only the genuine Electrolux EL097 replacement part.
