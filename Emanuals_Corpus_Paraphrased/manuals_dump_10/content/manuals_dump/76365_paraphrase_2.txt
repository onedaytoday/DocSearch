### Hose Installation and Maintenance Instructions

Ensure the hose is properly supplied. If an inflow hose is necessary, it must be VDE-approved and equipped with a hose screw from AEG Service Force, whether with or without hose fittings. Ensure the hose is connected securely, either manually or as illustrated. Tighten the hose as needed, aligning it straight with the screw thread (inches) using hand-tightening. Prioritize following operational guidelines to keep it free from obstructions.

The provided hose should be used for drainage. Ensure the internal structure of the hose is clear and that it is positioned upright, with the top elevated to facilitate drainage. The hose should be covered adequately. If the hose is misplaced, ensure that the pump's height is measured from the appliance head for optimal performance. Contact AEG Service Force for further instructions and compliance details.
