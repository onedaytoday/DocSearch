**Instructions for Mounting Locations**

To properly mount the unit, follow these steps: Position the mounting plate on either the left or right side as indicated in the assembly diagram. Use the screws shown to secure it, ensuring both screws are inserted as illustrated. 

Adjust the offset of the plate to align with the head of the unit. Tighten each screw securely, as failure to do so may result in misalignment or instability. 

If necessary, measure the width of the fence from the specified points, and make sure to tighten the fixing screws precisely according to the indicated measurements for models UK and PK or PKF. Ensure that all screws are fitted accurately to maintain the structure's integrity.
