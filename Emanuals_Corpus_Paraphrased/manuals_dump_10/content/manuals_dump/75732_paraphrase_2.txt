If the appliance's light is not functioning properly, it may indicate that the food inside is excessively cold, possibly due to frost accumulation. The appliance may have a malfunctioning switch, blown fuse, or defective thermostat, which can lead to incorrect temperature readings. 

To address this, temporarily adjust the thermostat to a warmer setting. Refer to the appropriate sections in the manual for initial troubleshooting and ensure all components are in their proper locations. 

**Caution: Electrical Hazards!** Please turn off the light switch and disconnect from the power supply before making any repairs. To access the light, remove the screw and press the light cover as indicated. Ensure the light is properly secured after replacement.

### Technical Details

Cooling mechanisms within the appliance efficiently manage heat by drawing warmth from the food and transferring it to other parts.
