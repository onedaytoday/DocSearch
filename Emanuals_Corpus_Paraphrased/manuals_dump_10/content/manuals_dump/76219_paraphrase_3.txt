## Performing Initial Setup

To reattach the assembly, use the course-thread counter-sunk screws to secure the latch and locate it correctly. Begin with the cover plate, positioning it from the right side, and then align it securely with the operation mechanism of the latch. Ensure the cover is applied to the top, rotating it clockwise. Additionally, the connection with the washer should involve a matching washer for proper fit.

For the MATCHING STORAGE PEDESTAL, refer to the corresponding part numbers: White P/N EPWD15IW, Mediterranean P/N EPWD15MB, Stainless Steel P/N EPWD15SS, and Titanium Silver P/N EPWD15TS. The recommended DRAIN HOSE EXTENSION KIT P/N is available to facilitate the needed length for proper drainage from the washer when installed above a dryer, particularly in stacking configurations.

For mobile installations, utilize the MOBILE HOME INSTALLATION KIT P/N. A UNIVERSAL APPLIANCE WRENCH P/N is advised for securing the washer; however, an alternative wrench may also suffice.
