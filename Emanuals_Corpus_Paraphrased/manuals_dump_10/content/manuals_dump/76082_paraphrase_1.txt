### Instructions for Cleaner Operation

**Thank you for selecting this cleaner. The following instructions are included for your convenience:**

#### Accessories and Safety Precautions
Ensure the cleaner is properly earthed and that insulation is intact. Use the cleaner only as specified; avoid forcing the cover shut. Handle sharp objects with care to prevent injury, and ensure that warranty conditions are not compromised. For any servicing or repairs, contact an authorized service center.

#### Before Starting
Prior to operation, confirm that the cleaner's front cover is securely attached and that the hose is properly connected. Check that the carrying handle clicks into place and ensure all components are secure. Press the On/Off button to activate the cleaner.

#### Getting the Best Results
To achieve optimal performance, adjust the suction settings for carpet or hard floor depending on your needs. Utilize the appropriate attachments for cleaning crevices and corners. Always switch off the cleaner while stationary.

#### Replacing the Dust Bag
Replace the dust bag when the indicator turns red. To do this, press the catches to release the hose and front cover. Remove the old bag (model EF54) and install a new one, ensuring proper placement. Replace the microfilter (model EFH12) and HEPA filter (model EF17) regularly for best performance.

#### Cleaning the Hose and Nozzle
If the hose becomes blocked, turn off the cleaner and clear any obstructions. Regularly check the hose and nozzle for dirt buildup and clean as needed to maintain suction efficiency.

#### Troubleshooting and Consumer Information
For troubleshooting, verify that the cleaner is connected to power and the hose is not clogged. If issues persist, consult an authorized service provider. For additional consumer information and recycling guidance, please visit www.electrolux.com.
