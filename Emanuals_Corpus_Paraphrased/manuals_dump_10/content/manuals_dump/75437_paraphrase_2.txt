### Installation Instructions for Freestanding Gas Range

**Important Notice**: Installation and servicing must be conducted by a qualified technician. This guide should be kept for the local electrical inspector's reference. Please review and retain these instructions for future use. Incorrect installation may lead to fire hazards or property damage.

**Safety Advisory**: If you detect the smell of gas:
1. Avoid using any electrical switches.
2. Evacuate the building immediately.
3. Notify neighbors.
4. Contact the gas service provider following safety procedures.

**Clearances and Location**: Ensure proper placement of the appliance to meet gas venting and supply requirements as specified in the guidelines. Verify that all clearances are maintained according to manufacturer specifications. Adjustments may reduce appliance performance.

**Installation Protocol**: Follow local building codes and the National ANSI/NFPA guidelines for the installation. Ensure the appliance is properly grounded. The grounding method must withstand heat and should not exceed temperatures above 90Â°F without degradation. 

For models featuring a self-cleaning option, adhere strictly to cleaning instructions to maintain appliance safety.

**Electrical Ignition**: Do not attempt to ignite the oven during a power outage. In such cases, reset all oven controls to "OFF" until power is restored.

**Tools Required**: Prepare a wrench, screwdriver, and any necessary tools specified in the installation kit.

**Gas Supply Connection**: The gas supply line should not exceed the recommended length and must be securely connected. Test for leaks and ensure the system is properly isolated during maintenance.

**Grounding Instructions**: Ensure the appliance is grounded according to local regulations. Do not modify the grounding prong on the power cord under any circumstances.

**Assembly of Components**: Ensure that all burner heads and grates are installed in their specified locations. Avoid allowing any food, cleaning agents, or spills into the gas orifice holder.

**Final Checks**: After installation, verify the ignition system functions correctly and the burners light within four seconds. Adjust the flame settings as necessary, ensuring the correct flow for optimal operation.

Retain these instructions for convenience and reference during any future service or maintenance tasks.
