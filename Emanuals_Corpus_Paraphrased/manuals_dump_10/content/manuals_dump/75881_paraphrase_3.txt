### Warning!

When using the appliance, particularly for food storage, ensure that products subjected to frost should be introduced to the super-frost function only after being thawed. If food has been affected by frost for an extended period (generally more than a few hours), it is advisable to use it within a short timeframe, as prolonged exposure can compromise the food quality.

### Tips for Food Storage

- For meat and other perishables, use polythene bags or airtight containers to ensure proper preservation.
- Thoroughly clean all utensils, containers, and surfaces to prevent cross-contamination.
- Onions, garlic, and similar items should be stored in adequately sealed containers.
- Follow defrosting guidelines to minimize frost buildup; using the appliance while empty can help maintain efficiency. 

### Maintenance

Regular maintenance is crucial. Clean the interior and exterior of the appliance with a suitable cleaner, particularly around the cooling components and the back section. Ensure that it operates at the optimal temperature (0°C) for food freshness. If the appliance is not functioning correctly, only qualified technicians should perform repairs or recharging.

### Defrosting Instructions

Defrosting can usually be triggered via the designated ON/OFF button. For effective defrosting, the frost buildup should be monitored; significant thickness may necessitate a temporary power cut. Complete defrosting should occur in no less than one hour.
