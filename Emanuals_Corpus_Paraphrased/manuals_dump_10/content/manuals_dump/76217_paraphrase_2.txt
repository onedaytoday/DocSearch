If the **START/PAUSE** button is pressed, the light will flash during the selected phase.

If an incorrect option is chosen, the corresponding indicators will flash to alert the user. The **RINSE HOLD** function prevents items from creasing after finishing the wash cycle. The countdown timer provides an hourly display for selected programs. 

Warnings will appear for incorrect selections and for phases that should not be interrupted. Users are advised to sort laundry by color and type, treating whites and colors separately to maintain fabric integrity. Items should be processed efficiently, using the appropriate compartments for additives and detergents as per the provided guidelines.

Here’s a paraphrased version of your text in a natural and technical way while maintaining the original meaning:

The washing instructions should clearly indicate the appropriate settings and temperature for the different fabric types. Items labeled as Synthetics (Easy-care) should be washed at 60°C, which is suitable for nightgowns, pyjamas, tablecloths, work shirts, and pillowcases. For Delicates, special care is needed during washing. Woolens require specific attention and should not exceed the recommended washing conditions. 

When using laundry bleach, ensure that it is appropriate for both whites and colors. Heavy stain removers like VANISH In-Wash and GloWhite are effective for tough stains and should be added directly to the detergent. For delicate items, use specially formulated fabric conditioners to maintain their quality. Always refer to the washing machine's instructions and guidelines, particularly for using non-biological detergents like Fairy.

When using compact powders and liquids, follow the instructions closely to maximize cleaning efficiency. For organizing the washer, place detergents in the designated compartments as indicated, and be cautious about the quantity. 

To operate the washer, switch it on/off using the MAX button. If three lights flash, it indicates a reset function. Selecting options such as EXTRA RINSE or RINSE HOLD will illuminate the corresponding indicators. For STAIN, PREWASH, or QUICK WASH settings, specific lights will inform you of the selected cycle. Adjust the SPIN SPEED for delicate, cold, or synthetic items accordingly, referring to the machine’s various phase indicators.

Starting the wash cycle involves pressing the START/PAUSE button, which will illuminate a flashing light indicating activity within the cycle. If RINSE HOLD is selected, that indicator will also flash during the cycle. For delayed start options, press the START/PAUSE button to set a countdown for the chosen delay.

For an economy wash, select the Economy setting (E) instead of 95°C for whites; typically at around 67°C with slight variations based on incoming water temperature. This setting is suitable for short synthetics and cold washes for shirts and towels. Additional functions such as DURFILL and SPIN SPEED options can be utilized for better performance with different fabric types. 

Be mindful of the duration charts and additional phases for optimal washing results, particularly for heavily soiled items.

### Economy Washing Instructions

For regular white loads, choose the Economy setting instead of the 95°C option. For synthetics, select approximately 67°C, adjusting to 60°C when appropriate. Use the Short cycle for lightly soiled cotton and synthetic fabrics, as well as for shirts and towels. If washing delicate items like wool, opt for the Cold setting, ensuring the cycle includes the necessary rinse options. 

To initiate the cycle or make adjustments, press the START/PAUSE button. For additional rinsing or prewash options, select those as needed. If the system indicates an error (E00, E10, E20), follow the troubleshooting guidelines. 

For maintenance, ensure the hose is correctly affixed, and check for blockages if emptying malfunctions or if water drains slowly. Clean the filter as required by unscrewing the appropriate components. Make sure actions are performed safely, turning off the water supply before disassembling any parts.

In case of water temperatures below 0°C, ensure the machine is in a suitable location to prevent freezing. Check all connections and perform necessary adjustments or service as guided in the troubleshooting section.

### Maintenance and Troubleshooting

After use, check for any debris in the hose and filter. If the machine exhibits unusual sounds or operational issues, ensure the hose is properly adjusted and the system is free of blockages. If prompted by error codes, refer to the manual for specific solutions and service contacts.

When handling stubborn stains, ensure the right settings are selected for effective cleaning. Promptly treat any heavily soiled fabrics to prevent staining.
