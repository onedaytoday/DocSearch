**Placement of Burners and Heads**  
The burner locations are outlined as follows: the right burner in the front, the front burner in the middle, and the rear burner positioned at the back. Each burner should be clearly visible and well-lit, displaying a steady yellow-orange flame. It is crucial to ensure the burners are correctly aligned with their respective heads. Refer to the cleaning instructions for each head to ensure they match properly. Always check to ensure burners are set correctly before lighting them. If issues arise with the flame, consult the service manual for assistance.

**Cooking Guidelines**  
Balance the amount of food with the cookware used to maximize heat conductivity and ensure cleanliness. Follow the cooking instructions closely for optimal results, adjusting heat levels as needed. Factors such as the type of food and desired doneness will affect cooking times and should be monitored via the included thermometer. If the food cools down excessively, it may not cook correctly; conversely, if too much heat is applied, food could overcook. Avoid using warped or uneven-bottomed cookware. 

**Safety Precautions**  
Use caution with items placed near the cooktop, and avoid leaving flammable objects like potholders nearby. To light the burners manually, use a match held to the burner head while turning the gas on. When using the warmer, please ensure the items are positioned upright for even heating, and always cover food to retain heat. The warmer is designed for maintaining food temperatures with settings for warming and cooking. Before using, note that children should be kept away when the warmer is hot.

**Oven Functionality**  
The oven allows temperatures from 170°F to 550°F, with a default setting of 350°F for preheating. It is recommended to space racks appropriately. To use the upper oven, select the respective settings on the control panel and monitor cooking progress. The oven's features include options for convection, broiling, and baking, providing flexibility for various cooking needs. Always ensure food is cooked thoroughly to prevent foodborne illnesses and automatically shut off the oven after the timer expires.

**Convection Cooking Efficiency**  
The convection feature circulates heat for even cooking. It's effective for reducing cooking times and enhancing food texture. Preheat the oven as instructed, and adjust cooking times according to the recipe and food type. When using the convection mode, it may be necessary to lower cooking temperatures by 25°F compared to standard baking methods. Follow the provided charts for guidance on specific food items.

**Final Notes on Roasting**  
Ensure a snug fit of the roasting pan into the oven for optimal heat circulation. Adjust cooking times based on food type and size, referring to the roasting chart for guidance on whole poultry and meats. Maintain cleanliness to prevent grease fires, and do not cover or obstruct vents while roasting for efficient heat distribution.


The cooking process for the food is complete. The cooking feature indicates its readiness by displaying "ON." The food should be maintained at a temperature between 150°F and 190°F, ideally around 170°F. To ensure the food is heat-safe, allow it to cool down before repeated reheating. Covering the food can help retain heat.

For slow cooking, you can use the Crock-Pot setting to avoid burning, especially with poultry. Cook times vary based on temperature settings (HI or LO), with options for continuous cooking if activated. It is essential to always check the food's temperature and ensure it is properly thawed before cooking.

When dehydrating, maintain a temperature range between 100°F and 225°F, ideally around 120°F. Use the "DEHYDRATE" setting to properly prepare the food. For defrosting, utilize the "DEFROST" feature, ensuring compliance with USDA guidelines for safe thawing without cooking.

For proofing dough, maintain temperatures between 85°F and 100°F, allowing the yeast to activate. Use the "BREAD PROOF" setting and monitor while it's active.

The "PERFECT" setting ensures precise cooking, maintaining food temperatures from 170°F to 550°F, particularly around 325°F. It is vital to secure the roasting pan to catch grease and properly seat food for even cooking.

The oven also features various cooking methods, including Convection. Selecting the appropriate setting allows optimal cooking across different stages. Follow on-screen prompts to utilize these features effectively.

User preferences for clock settings and sound options can be adjusted under the "USER PREF" menu. This includes options for clock display and volume settings. If needed, the oven can be reset to factory settings.

Ensure you are familiar with these features, as they enhance the cooking experience and ensure food safety and quality.

### General Cleaning Tips

Regular cleaning reduces the frequency of deep-cleaning efforts. Clean all surfaces with appropriate cloths and avoid harsh scouring pads that can scratch finishes. For stuck-on residues, a mixture of cleaning agents may be required, followed by thorough rinsing with a damp cloth.

### Light Shield Maintenance

The light shield should always be in place during oven operations. Ensure it is cool before handling. Clean the shield regularly to maintain visibility and performance. 

### Cooktop and Burner Cleaning

Maintain the cooktop by cleaning it after each use while it is still warm. Use non-abrasive materials and methods to avoid scratches. The burner heads must be correctly seated during operation to ensure safety and efficiency. Follow the manufacturer's guideline for thorough cleaning, ensuring the appliance is turned off and cool before proceeding. 

By adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively maintain the cleanliness and functionality of your cooking appliance, prolonging its lifespan and performance.

### Instruction for Proper Use and Maintenance

**Preheating Guidelines**  
When using your oven to bake items such as breads and cakes, ensure it is preheated correctly. It is essential to avoid overcrowding, as this can cause uneven cooking or warping of the food. Follow the temperature guidelines closely, which may advise preheating to a range of 25°F (12°C) above what is typically recommended.
