The process involves using the designated buttons to select appropriate options for washing. When selecting items, it’s important to prioritize efficiency, particularly by choosing the lowest temperature settings for various fabric types including synthetics. Sorting should be done according to fabric categories: whites, colors, synthetics, and other specific types such as towels and tablecloths. White items require special attention because they should be washed separately to maintain their brightness.

To address stubborn stains, pre-treat items overnight using a compatible cleaning solution, followed by a wash cycle that may include bleach for white items only. All care instructions must be followed diligently to avoid damage, particularly for synthetics and fitted clothing. It is essential to prevent overloading the washer to ensure items are cleaned properly.

For drying, adhere to specific guidelines outlined in the user manual. Keep washer-dryer components clean to enhance longevity and performance, including the emptying hose. Ensure that the machine is disconnected from the power supply when performing maintenance.

If you experience malfunctions, the machine will display specific error codes (such as E10, E20, E40). Troubleshooting these issues may involve checking if hoses are properly secured and that the machine is loaded correctly. Regular inspection and maintenance of hoses and filters are essential to prevent clogs.

Should any component become jammed or if issues occur, address them by following the maintenance instructions provided in the manual. Proper operations will help avoid repeated malfunctions and ensure efficient cleaning cycles.
