**Cleaning the Comfort Unit**

Clean the back of the unit, ensuring that grease is removed by hand or in a dishwasher. Allow the components to dry completely before reassembling them, ensuring they are oriented correctly. Press the Stop button and hold for at least a few seconds until the T1 light flashes. Before cleaning or maintenance, disconnect the power supply. The charcoal filters should be cleaned or replaced whenever the indicator flashes, at least once every few months. The unit can be turned off by switching off the lights and disconnecting the power supply. The T2 light should activate normally within seconds, indicating the following statuses: "Charcoal ENABLED" or "Charcoal DISABLED."

**Removing/Replacing the Charcoal Filters**

Begin by removing the grease that has accumulated around the activated charcoal by loosening the screws, as shown in the manual. After releasing the charcoal filters, hold down the Stop button for several seconds until the T1 light flashes. This indicates that the grease and charcoal must be cleaned as recommended. Unscrew the screws to remove the circular component from its mount. Replace the charcoal filters as applicable, following the guidance for proper reassembly with the support screws. 

**For Service Issues**

If the unit is not functioning correctly, refer to the troubleshooting section in the manual before contacting Service Force. Note that some symptoms may be caused by issues such as insufficient power supply or a blown fuse. Ensure that the unit is properly connected to the electricity supply and that the switch is turned ON to facilitate grease cleaning. An ineffective charcoal filter may need replacement.
