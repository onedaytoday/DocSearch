If you are replacing the ON/OFF switch and notice overheating or cracks, immediately turn off the device. Safely disconnect it from the power source and allow it to cool before handling. Ensure that protective measures are in place, as personal safety is paramount. 

For error codes, if the display shows E1, the Elinchrom service suggests the unit has overheated; switch it off and allow cooling before switching back on. An E2 code indicates overheating; E3 signifies the unit is recharging. For E4, turn the unit off and back on. With E5, determine if the Elinchrom service is required. An E8 code points to overheating; again, allow the fan to cool down.

Technical specifications include: f-stop performance, recycling voltage of 5V, and CE/IEC EN compliance standards.
