**Ice Dispenser Maintenance and Water Filtration**

### Cleaning the Ice Dispenser
To clean the ice dispenser, first turn off the On/Off switch. Empty the ice bin and clean it thoroughly using clear water or suitable cleaners. Ensure that the components are completely dried before reassembling. Once cleaned, press the On/Off switch to turn it back on. 

**IMPORTANT:** If the unit is turned off, you might need to wait a few hours before it operates normally again. Regular maintenance is crucial to ensure optimal performance.

### PureSource™ Water Filter Information
If your appliance includes a PureSource™ water filtration system, refer to the information on the right side of the fresh food compartment. Ensure the water supply is turned off before proceeding with any maintenance. The filter housing is factory tested, and the PureSource™ system meets ANSI/NSF performance specifications. To maintain health standards, always replace the filter on a regular basis.

### PureSource2™ Water Filter Information
For appliances with the PureSource2™ system, please check the front section of the refrigerator. As with the PureSource™, ensure the water supply is off during maintenance. The system has been tested and meets ANSI/NSF standards. Replace the filter regularly to guarantee the best water quality.

### Food Storage Guidelines
Refrigerate fresh food at 34°F - 40°F (1°C - 4°C) to prevent overcrowding, which can impede air circulation and cooling efficiency. Store meat securely wrapped to avoid cross-contamination. The refrigerator operates best when loaded to about 75% capacity to allow optimal airflow.

### Energy Saving Tips
Minimize exposure of the refrigerator to direct sunlight and avoid placing it near heat sources like stoves or dishwashers. Ensure good insulation around the unit and avoid overcrowding to maintain efficiency.

### Understanding Refrigeration Sounds
Expect to hear various operational sounds from your refrigerator, which may include:

- A flowing sound as refrigerant circulates.
- Hissing from the defrost heater during operation.
- Mechanical sounds when the defrost cycle activates.

**IMPORTANT:** If sounds become irregular or alarming, consult the service manual.

### Cleaning Instructions
Use mild cleaners and avoid abrasive pads when cleaning the interior. Check for any buildup and clean thoroughly every month to optimize performance.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
If you encounter cooling issues, ensure the appliance is plugged in and the circuit breaker is operational. Check the door seals for proper fit. For excessively cold temperatures, allow the unit to stabilize by adjusting settings and letting food warm slightly.

For further maintenance or service, consult your owner’s manual or contact customer support directly.

### Issue Identification and Resolution

**Issue: Elevated Temperatures**
- **Cause:** The meat is stored at warmer than optimal temperatures, leading to excess water, moisture, or frost accumulation within the refrigerator due to improper sealing or external weather conditions.
- **Correction:** Ensure refrigerator doors and drawers are properly closed. If the ambient temperature impact is significant, refrigerate items for longer to reach lower temperatures. If necessary, adjust temperature settings and allow time for cooler airflow.

**Issue: Ice Maker Malfunction**
- **Cause:** The ice maker may not be producing sufficient ice due to blockages or insufficient water supply.
- **Correction:** Check for any clogs and ensure doors are securely closed. Regularly clean the ice maker components to prevent blockages and maintain proper functionality. 

**Issue: Water Dispenser Challenges**
- **Cause:** The water supply could be disrupted due to clogs or improper connection to the household plumbing.
- **Correction:** Inspect the lines for blockages and ensure they are connected correctly.

**Issue: Unpleasant Odors in Refrigerator**
- **Cause:** Food items may be spoiled or improperly stored, contributing to unwanted smells.
- **Correction:** Clean the interior thoroughly and ensure that food is stored in sealed containers.

**Issue: Light Bulb Not Functioning**
- **Cause:** The light bulb may have burned out or be disconnected.
- **Correction:** Check the light bulb and the corresponding switch to confirm connectivity. Replace as needed.

**Issue: Refrigerator Running Inefficiently**
- **Cause:** The refrigerator may be running inefficiently due to various factors, including overloading or improper cleaning.
- **Correction:** Ensure the refrigerator is not overloaded, and that all internal components are clean. 

### General Maintenance
Regularly schedule maintenance checks to ensure all components are functioning properly to avoid future issues.
