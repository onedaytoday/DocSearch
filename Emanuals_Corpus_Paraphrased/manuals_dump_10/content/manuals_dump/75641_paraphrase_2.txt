**CAUTION:** Ensure compliance with all applicable regulations, including the National Electrical Code (NEC), as established by NFPA. When connecting the system, verify that the grounding meets the specified standards. The technician must ensure proper grounding; if connections lead to potential shorts or faults, a fused switch (or equivalent) is required. It is recommended to implement lockout/tagout procedures during maintenance for safety. The electrical supply must match the rated capacity and specifications indicated for the installation location.

### B.2.3 REVERSING DOOR OPENING

Typically, doors open to the right. To reverse this, follow these steps, starting from the power supply: remove the screw from part E and detach components G and F, then reattach H accordingly, ensuring all connections are secure.

### C.1 OPERATIONS AND USER INSTRUCTIONS

#### C.1.1 CONTROL PANEL ACCESS FOR HIGH HUMIDITY SERVICE

The control panel provides access to high humidity service options and visual indicators such as ON/OFF alarms and food category selections.

#### C.1.2 INITIAL POWER ON AND TEMPERATURE SETTING

To activate the system, press the ON/OFF switch. Follow on-screen prompts for temperature settings; the set point will display after a few seconds. The manual mode and compressor status indicators will also appear. Adjust the temperature within the specified range of MIN 32째F (0째C) to MAX 50째F (10째C).

#### C.1.3 STORING PRODUCTS BY CATEGORY

Select the appropriate food category from the options provided to organize items within the chamber. The panel will indicate if categories are set or if none is selected.

#### C.1.4 HIGH HUMIDITY FUNCTION

Activating the "HIGH HUMIDITY ON/OFF" button will illuminate the corresponding indicator on the panel. The chamber will reflect temperature readings according to the set conditions.

#### C.1.5 PRODUCT LOADING

Ensure adequate airflow in the chamber by distributing food products effectively, maintaining spacing to avoid blocking the air circulation.
