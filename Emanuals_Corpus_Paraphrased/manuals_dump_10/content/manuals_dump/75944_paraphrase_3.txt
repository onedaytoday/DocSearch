### Paraphrased Text

#### Normal Operating Sounds
You may notice various sounds emanating from the appliance, including whirring from the cooling system or the thermostat. Normal sounds can occur when food is placed improperly or left uncovered, which can affect heat circulation among the items. Appliances like cookers and dishwashers may hinder airflow if they are obstructed, causing food to cool inadequately or leading to improper closing of doors.

#### Automatic Defrosting
The appliance features an automatic defrosting mechanism, which directs condensation to collect in a trough at the rear. Ensure you disconnect the power supply before cleaning, and use gentle cleaning agents to avoid damaging components. Be cautious with substances containing bleach or harsh chemicals, as they may compromise the appliance's integrity.

#### Maintenance Reminder
Regular cleaning is essential, as dust buildup can impair cooling efficiency. It is advisable to clean the back of the appliance periodically with appropriate cleaners. 

#### Light Indicator
Be mindful of the light system, which has specific voltage and wattage specifications. If the light malfunctions, switch it off using the designated ON/OFF control and follow the instructions to replace the light cover and secure screws properly.

#### Troubleshooting
If abnormal sounds or flashing warning lights occur, it may indicate higher-than-expected temperatures within the unit. Ensure that doors are properly closed and that food placement does not obstruct airflow. If issues persist, contact AEG Service Force for mechanical assistance.
