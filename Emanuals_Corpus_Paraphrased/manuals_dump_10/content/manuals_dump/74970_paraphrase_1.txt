### Essential Guidelines for Microwave Use and Food Safety

When using the microwave to heat or cook food, it's crucial to do so uniformly and thoroughly to prevent foodborne illnesses. Always ensure that food and beverage containers, such as bottles, are specifically labeled as microwave-safe to avoid burns or spills. It's advisable to use covered bowls or containers during heating to minimize splattering.

#### Recommended Microwave Containers:
Opt for heat-resistant materials like microwave-safe glasses, ceramics, and certain plastics. Avoid using non-heat-resistant plastics, as they can melt or leach harmful substances into food. Refer to your microwave's user manual for a list of approved materials and preheating guidelines.

#### Cooking and Reheating Instructions:
For optimal performance, cover food securely when microwaving. This can prevent splatter and ensure even cooking. Do not allow food to overheat or dry out while reheating. Consider using see-through covers to monitor the progress without removing them. The turntable must rotate freely for even heat distribution during cooking.

### Control Panel Overview:
The control panel provides various preset options for cooking functions, allowing you to select according to the type of food. For example:
- Fish/Seafood
- Fresh Rolls/Muffins
- Ground Meat
- Various Vegetables and Casseroles

### Manual and Power Cooking:
To manually set cook times, input your desired seconds and start cooking. You can adjust power levels as needed, indicated on the control panel. Common settings range from high (100%) to low/defrost (10%). 

### Convection Cooking:
When using convection features, preheat the oven if required and set the desired cooking time. The appliance will signal when preheating is complete.

### Defrosting:
Select the defrost option to thaw meats or other foods based on their weight. The appliance will automatically adjust the time based on the input.

### Auto Cooking:
Utilize the auto-cook function for various preset meal types, ensuring a convenient and optimal cooking experience. Select the corresponding food type and press 'start' to initiate.

In summary, adhere to these guidelines for a safe and effective microwave cooking experience, ensuring optimal food quality and safety.
