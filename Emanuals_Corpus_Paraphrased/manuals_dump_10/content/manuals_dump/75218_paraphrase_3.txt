After selecting the cooking function, the preheated appliance will adjust to the desired setting for cooking food. For conventional cooking, ensure that the necessary parameters are set. Press the designated button when the desired temperature is reached, indicated by acoustic signals, at which point the appliance will automatically turn off. The chosen function will notify you when cooking is complete based on the set time, either through the cook time or end time settings.

If the timer needs adjusting, you can switch between cooking functions by pressing the clock button as needed. The cook time or end time settings will flash, and you have a few seconds to finalize the adjustments. Once the cooking time is completed, the appliance will turn off automatically, and you can disable the timer using the clock button if necessary.

For countdown functionality, initiate the countdown as required, which will also flash when activated. Once the countdown expires, you'll hear a signal, and the countdown function will turn off.

Regarding lighting, it can be manually switched on or off using the dedicated button. If the clock is off, pressing it briefly will re-enable it. The clock will automatically turn off after a set period of inactivity.

For safety, a child lock feature is available that can be activated or deactivated using specific buttons. When engaged, the display will indicate "SAFE." 

When utilizing cooking functions such as PIZZA BAKING, FAN COOKING, or CONVENTIONAL, preheat the appliance accordingly. Ensure you are aware of the appropriate shelf levels for different cooking methods. It is advisable to preheat your oven for optimal results.

The instructions guide you on the correct positioning of dishes and how to effectively manage cooking times, particularly for various baked goods. This ensures proper cooking without overbaking or uneven results.

For roasting, use the proper settings to achieve desired doneness without burning. Utilize compatible roasting dishes and adjust the shelf positions as necessary based on the volume of food being prepared.

In summary, refer to the specific cooking instructions for each function and adapt settings based on what is being cooked, ensuring both safety and quality in your food preparation process.
