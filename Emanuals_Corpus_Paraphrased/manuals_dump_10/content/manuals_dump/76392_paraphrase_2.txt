Whether they chose traditional powders or liquids, it is important to note that traditional powders should be used directly with the clothes. In contrast, traditional liquids can be measured and placed in the appropriate compartments, typically at the top or back of the machine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for both compact powders and liquids. Fabric conditioners should also be used according to specific guidelines to enhance the performance of laundry, especially when it includes easy-care and synthetic fabrics. 

Load restrictions apply: overloading the machine can lead to undesirable results, including fire hazards or mechanical issues. It's essential to sort items correctly based on fabric type to prevent creasing and maintain the integrity of the materials.

During the washing process, various settings are available such as Normal, Quick, or specific fabric care. The machine will indicate the selected cycle, and it's crucial to pause or start the machine appropriately. When using features like Rinse Hold or Extra Rinse, make sure to follow the necessary steps and be aware of the lights indicating the selected options.

When initiating a wash cycle, select your preferences and start the machine. If you've selected delayed start, it will count down before beginning. For acoustic feedback options like NO BUZZER, you can deactivate sound notifications if needed.

In case of an error or if the machine is not operating as expected, check for issues such as water supply or door closure. If problems persist, refer to troubleshooting instructions or contact service support.

Regular maintenance and cleaning of hoses and components are crucial to ensure optimal performance. Follow the steps for cleaning and checking hoses to avoid blockages or leaks. 

When dealing with low temperatures, take special care of the water used in the machine as it may affect performance. 

For any issues reflected in error codes, consult the troubleshooting guide, ensuring to note any flashing lights or sounds that indicate specific problems.

Ensure that the hose is correctly connected according to the instructions. Both ends of the hose should be securely fastened to facilitate proper cleaning and emptying operations.
