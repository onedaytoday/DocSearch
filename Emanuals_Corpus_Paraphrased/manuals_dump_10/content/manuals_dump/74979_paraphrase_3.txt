**Operating Instructions**

The switches on the right indicate their functions. Both switches will automatically turn off when the cooking process is complete, accompanied by a warning sound. The indicators will flash. To activate, press the appropriate button corresponding to the cooking function.

**Shelf Information**

The shelves are arranged from top to bottom. Make sure to position the heat-resistant sheets facing the front for optimal cooking results, particularly for cakes. When using the Ventitherm function, preheat once to ensure even cooking, and adjust your shelf positions accordingly. It's crucial to monitor the height of items in the oven, as this may affect cooking time.

**Dough Preparation**

For yeast dough, allow sufficient time for rising. Preheat the oven using the C function. Use a flour-covered surface for rolling or shaping the dough. Ensure the dough is not overly compressed to maintain its structure.

**Baking Instructions**

When baking items like cakes or pastries, it’s important to ensure even cooking. Switching the heat off at the right time helps prevent overcooking. Gradually increase cooking times as necessary, keeping an eye on the items.

**Roasting Guidelines**

When determining the cooking time for meats, consider both the type and quantity. Use either the Ventitherm or Rotitherm function for optimal roasting. Monitor the internal temperature using a thermometer for best results.

**Defrosting Procedures**

For defrosting, utilize the Ventitherm function at the specified temperature. It’s advisable to leave food uncovered or half-covered, ensuring faster and more efficient defrosting. Turn items during the process for even thawing.

**Preservation Techniques**

Utilize the preservation function with appropriate screw-top containers. Ensure a suitable amount of food and ensure containers are properly sealed to prevent spoilage.
