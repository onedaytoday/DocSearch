### Operating Instructions for Cooking Functions

**Selecting the Cooking Function:**

To begin, turn the dial to choose your desired cooking function. The cavity light will illuminate to indicate that the heating elements are active. Once the set temperature is reached, the heating element will deactivate, along with the light. 

After your food is cooked, turn the dial counterclockwise to ensure it is fully disengaged. Each function, including moderate and high heat settings, should be pre-heated efficiently for optimal cooking results.

**Pre-Heating:**

Using the pre-heat function allows the oven to reach the necessary temperature quickly, promoting even cooking. To activate, select the Heat function, turn the dial, and monitor the light indicator until it signifies readiness. Continue to follow the same procedure for other cooking options; the light will indicate when your food is prepared.

**Cooling Mechanism:**

The oven has an integrated cooling system that helps prevent overheating. The cooling fan will activate as needed and will eventually turn off once the internal temperature drops. Be cautious when cooking, as it’s important to maintain a safe environment.

**Countdown Timer:**

To use the countdown feature, press the MODE button to initiate the timer. While the light flashes, adjust the time using the appropriate buttons until the desired duration is displayed.

**Operation Confirmation:**

The oven's display will show the current cooking function. If the light continues to flash, the mode is still active. Pressing and holding the MODE button can confirm the operation and help reset.

**Safety Note:**

Always ensure the cooking program is properly selected, and monitor the cooking cycle to prevent any mishaps. During operation, avoid touching the heating elements directly.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Regular cleaning is important for optimal performance. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the exterior and ensure the cavity is free of residues. The oven features a self-cleaning function capable of removing grease and food particles through high heat.

**Special Functions:**

- **Defrost:** This function provides a gentle heat to safely thaw frozen foods.
- **Traditional Heat:** Ideal for baking cakes and roasts, it evenly distributes heat from above and below.
- **Warm Function:** Keeps food at a safe temperature without further cooking, using minimal heat.

**Final Reminder:**

When using multiple shelves, consider the required temperature adjustments based on food type. Always preheat as recommended, and utilize the function that best suits your cooking needs for consistent results.

To operate the cooking function, turn on the switch, which activates the LCD display. This will indicate the chosen cooking function, which can be set to turn off automatically after a few seconds. For models EDEE63CS, EUEE63CS, and EUEE63CK, select the desired option using the upper or lower parts of the control panel. The LCD will show which cavity is currently active.

When you make a selection, the display will highlight the cooking function. If another button is pressed within a few seconds, the toggle switch allows you to adjust the heat settings from 30°C to 250°C, reaching the desired temperature efficiently. Should you require further heating adjustments, the controls will respond within seconds.

The heating element will gradually warm up while indicating which area is currently active. Once the target temperature is achieved, the heat will turn off, accompanied by an audible signal. Pre-heating is advised to ensure efficient cooking and optimal food quality. Each function has a built-in heat-up phase that utilizes surrounding heat, making it more effective than manual methods.

To turn off the cavity, press the switch dedicated to this function. If other settings are still engaged, both the upper and lower controls need to be pressed once, while the LCD will notify you when switched off. The cooking light and LCD will deactivate automatically. The cooking process can be adjusted, including the time, through repeated presses of the "cook" button as necessary.

When setting the clock/timer, the operation can be adjusted easily with the buttons provided. To clear any previous settings, simply press the relevant buttons until the locked indicator disappears. The child lock feature helps prevent accidental adjustments.

Additionally, it’s essential to select the proper cooking location based on the food type, which allows for effective heat distribution. Sensibly arrange food to prevent overheating and ensure even browning, particularly when dealing with high-heat cooking methods.

For roasting meats, set the temperature between 180°C to 200°C. Ensure even cooking by selecting the appropriate shelf position and avoiding overcrowding. Monitoring food for optimal cooking results is crucial. When pre-heating, keep in mind the ideal conditions for each type, as specified in cooking guidelines.

Avoid placing food that is too thick or crowded, as this can impede heat distribution. Pay close attention to cooking times and adjust accordingly to ensure the best results. Follow these instructions to achieve optimum cooking performance and enjoy delicious meals.

### Cleaning and Maintenance Instructions for EPEE63CS and EPEE63CK Models

#### General Cleaning
To maintain optimal performance and longevity, ensure to clean the front surfaces and top light (specific to EPEE63CS and EPEE63CK models) regularly. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can cause scratches or damage, potentially leading to glass shattering. Always use a soft cloth and appropriate cleaning solutions to remove grease and food residues, and clean surfaces immediately after use to prevent buildup.

#### Catalytic Cleaning
Catalytic cleaning features a specialized coating that captures food residues, which can then be eliminated during the self-cleaning cycle. This function operates at around 180°C, followed by a temperature increase to 250°C for complete cleaning. If the catalytic surfaces become heavily soiled, they may need manual cleaning with a damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials for cleaning, as they can damage the coating.

#### Pyrolitic Self-Cleaning (EPEE63CS and EPEE63CK only)
The self-cleaning function heats the cavity to approximately 500°C to incinerate food remnants and grease. Before initiating this function, remove all items, including cookware and racks. It is advisable to wipe down the cavity afterward with a damp cloth. The cleaning cycle will include heating, cleaning, and cooling phases, which can take several hours.

#### Important Safeguards
Always switch off the appliance and unplug it before performing any maintenance. Take care not to touch hot surfaces, which can cause burns or electrical shocks. For complete safety, ensure that cooking functions are properly selected and activated, and avoid overcrowding the appliance with heavy items.

#### Troubleshooting
In case of malfunction, such as clock flashing or insufficient heating, consult the troubleshooting section of the user manual. If the appliance is under warranty, contact customer service for support. Specifically, check for tripped circuit breakers or blown fuses in the household supply.
