**Instructions for Sorting Laundry**

1. **Sorting Guidelines**: Follow the specified instructions for sorting laundry into categories: whites, coloreds, synthetics, and various fabric types (e.g., towels, tablecloths, sheets).
   
2. **Washing Sequence**: Always wash new colored items separately to prevent color bleeding. Begin washing with whites, pillowcases, or lightly soiled items. Certain fabrics may need pre-treatment with recommended products, as indicated in the care charts.

3. **Handling Stains**: For stubborn stains like grease, soak the fabric overnight with a suitable cleaning solution before washing. Utilize cold water for washing both whites and coloreds where applicable, and bleach should only be used for whites.

4. **Machine Setup**: Adjust washing machine settings based on the type of fabric and the level of soil. Pre-wash options are available if necessary. Select the appropriate temperature, typically recommended at 60Â°C.

5. **Adding Additives**: Incorporate any additional cleaning agents, such as fabric softeners or starch, as directed. 

6. **Operating the Machine**: Ensure the machine is switched on properly. If you encounter error codes (E10, E20, etc.), refer to troubleshooting steps in the manual for resolution. Properly close all hoses and ensure there are no clogs.

7. **Emergency Measures**: If draining issues occur, you may need to manually empty the machine. Follow the outlined procedures for disconnecting hoses and removing blockages.
