### Assembly Instructions

To assemble the frame, begin by securing the top and bottom tension elbows using the provided screws. Carefully install the screws to ensure alignment at both ends, connecting the short sections as illustrated in the accompanying diagrams. Ensure the screws are tightened fully to maintain proper tension across all four corners.

When attaching the tension plates to the back of the frame, align them according to the specified method. Ensure that each plate is affixed tightly to maintain optimal tension for the AcousticPro1080 material, which counteracts light interference and enhances acoustic performance.

For the AcousticPro1080, apply the plates in a manner that ensures a snug fit, which assists in minimizing wrinkling and improving overall aesthetic quality. Follow the guidelines carefully to ensure all components are assembled correctly.

### Important Notes

- When positioning the frame on the wall, verify that it is mounted on strong, structurally sound anchors, avoiding proximity to electrical outlets and switches.
- Use a soft cloth for cleaning, avoiding any harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. Keep all components out of reach of children.
