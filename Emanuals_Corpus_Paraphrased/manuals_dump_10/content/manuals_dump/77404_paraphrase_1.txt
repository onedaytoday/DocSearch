**CAUTION**: Before power is supplied to the EL device, ensure the following precautions are taken; the system must be isolated from the power supply to prevent overheating. For controls using a D.P.D.T. switch, ensure the switch is positioned correctly among its three possible settings. If any one position is reached, the corresponding D.P.D.T. switch must engage, while the other positions remain idle. Each switch should have proper insulation, and safe installation requires the chassis to be correctly grounded. 

**Important:** The warehouse environment must be kept clean, organized, and free from moisture and contaminants. Proper care should be taken to secure all protective covers to maintain warranty coverage.

When operating the heater, ensure that the supply lines are free from damage and that appropriate shielding is in place. 

**CAUTION**: Ensure power is disconnected before performing maintenance or repairs on switches. Follow the provided instructions for manual and electrical operation, and be cautious during reassembly and lubrication. The switch should move freely; if any obstruction is encountered, back off slightly and recheck the positioning to ensure proper functionality.
