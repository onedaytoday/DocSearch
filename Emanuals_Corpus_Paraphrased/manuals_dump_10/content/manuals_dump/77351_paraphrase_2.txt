**AX150 HBA and Connectivity Overview**

The AX150 supports various Host Bus Adapters (HBAs)—including the SB305008AE, SB140410AJE, DS3250VL2E, DS220BFFD, and DS210BDEU. These HBAs can connect directly to switches or through professional installation. The system does not permit simultaneous connections via direct cable and switch. Interswitch Link (ISL) configurations are supported for connectivity between switches.

When integrating the AX100 with different types of switches, it can either connect directly or through a network switch. The SP (Storage Processor) configuration is critical when establishing cluster connections for operation, booting options, and HBA definitions.

For SAN (Storage Area Network) integration, it's crucial to use SCSI protocols or similar interfaces for optimal functionality through the Path Definition with HBA and SP links. Remote replication capabilities are available via EMC's SAN Copy software to ensure data redundancy and recovery, particularly for AX150 deployments from branch locations.

**Supported Server Models and Hardware Compatibility:**

The AX150 is compatible with a range of HP ProLiant models, including various configurations of the DL series and ML series. This includes newer servers like R710, R910, and legacy models across several other brands (e.g., IBM, NEC).

**Connection Specifications:**

For optimal performance, ensure to utilize QLogic-based HBAs within the AX150 environment, with support for various PCI FCAL interfaces. The device and connections must align with EMC standards for seamless integration into enterprise-level SAN setups.

Through these guidelines, EMC emphasizes the importance of proper installation and SCSI path definitions for effective data management within AX150 architectures.

**Topology Overview for IBM and EMC Systems**

The IBM HS21, HS21 XM, LS21, and LS41 servers support booting from a Storage Area Network (SAN) utilizing DMMPIO software. EMC systems can also boot from EMC devices connected to the SAN, and this process is supported through the PowerPath software. The Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) is compatible with various Hardware-Based Adapters (HBAs), and booting from the SAN is possible via the BIOS configuration, as specified in the SNIA HBA API documentation.

It is crucial to verify compatibility with specific Oracle Enterprise Linux (OEL) versions, including 2.6.942 and 2.6.978 kernels, as detailed in the supported BIOS sections. Additionally, ensure that various HBA types, such as QLA products and the AX150, are present and function with the system BIOS for successful operation.

When utilizing SAN booting, particularly in environments like Microsoft or VMware ESX, ensure that the relevant hotfixes and updates are applied to all interconnected systems. Confirming compatibility with IBM MultiSwitch configurations and other integrated BIOS settings is necessary for efficient communication and device recognition across the network.

The document outlines a range of supported systems, including HP ProLiant models and PowerEdge servers, reinforcing the need to ensure that all components, including BIOS versions and firmware, are current and validated for interoperability with SAN configurations.

It is advisable to consult the manufacturer's specifications to verify device support, performance expectations, and any potential dependencies on specific BIOS or HBA configurations to maintain optimal operation within the infrastructure.
