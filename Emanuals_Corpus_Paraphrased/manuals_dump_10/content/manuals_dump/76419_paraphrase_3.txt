Ensure that the appliance is used correctly according to the specifications to maximize longevity and performance.

To maintain proper care of your laundry, it's essential to select the correct detergents for various fabrics. Use specifically formulated products for whites, colors, and delicate items; non-biological detergents like Fairy are recommended for sensitive skin. Bleaching agents should only be used on appropriate items; avoid using them on delicate fabrics.

For traditional laundry, whether in powder or liquid form, follow the manufacturer's instructions, including those on the product packaging. Fabric conditioners can enhance softness but should be used according to washing machine guidelines. 

When washing, categorize items by color and type—such as whites, non-fast colors, and delicate fabrics. The washing temperature typically adheres to EEC Directives, with maximum loading specifications for synthetics and varying spin speeds depending on fabric type.

Remember to ensure that washing machines are regularly cleaned and maintained to avoid blockages. If the machine malfunctions, troubleshoot using the guide provided or contact Service Force for assistance. 

For optimal operation, verify that all hoses are correctly secured and that the washer is drained if necessary. Be mindful of any service requirements or warranties associated with your appliance, and follow specified guidelines to ensure proper functionality. 

Ensure compliance with local regulations during usage, which include specifications on power supply, maximum load capabilities, and water pressure. 

Please consult the technical specifications provided for detailed dimensions, power supply requirements, and washing capacities.

**Unpacking and Installation Instructions**

Upon unpacking, ensure that the hoses are not pinched or damaged. Remove the screws from the polythene packaging and keep them with the corresponding components. Install the unit upright, ensuring that the three spacers from the rear are properly fitted. The instructions included should guide you in positioning the hoses, ensuring that they do not interfere with any existing plumbing or connections. The hoses—hot and cold—must be connected via a BSP thread. If further connections are needed, sourcing advice from a plumbing merchant or professional is recommended.

For permanent plumbing, follow these key steps: Firstly, connect the supplied hose to the internal service. Ensure that the hose aligns properly, and that it is secured at the top to prevent leaks. 

The hoses from Service Force should be connected correctly. Any water supply lines must be installed securely; use washers to prevent leaks.
