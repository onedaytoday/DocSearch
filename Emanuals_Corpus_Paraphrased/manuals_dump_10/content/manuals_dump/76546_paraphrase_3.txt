The right front head screws only into the right-hand side. Ensure it is properly installed, grounded, and tested according to the specifications provided. The three-phase outlets must be wired correctly, adhering to the specified rating for shock protection (RCD). The outletâ€™s configuration is crucial; incorrect phase rotation can cause operational issues, leading to potential injury. The system should be switched off immediately in the event of any operational anomaly. Always ensure safety precautions, including wearing hearing protection, and be aware of the cutting equipment being used.

When operating, avoid contact with moving parts, which might pose hazards. The working height of the machine must be adjusted properly, and the head must rotate clockwise; any counter-clockwise rotation indicates incorrect assembly. Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential to ensure optimal performance. Follow the recommended protocols for service and inspections regularly.

For transportation and disassembly, follow instructions to avoid damages. Routine checks of protection mechanisms are necessary to identify any potential overheating risks. Ensure adherence to sound level regulations, and always utilize personal protective equipment as specified.
