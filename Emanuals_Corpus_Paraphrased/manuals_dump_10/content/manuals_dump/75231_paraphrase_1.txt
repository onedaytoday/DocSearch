### Defrosting Function:
To defrost food, remove it from any packaging and place it on a shelf. Cover it with a plate, as this helps maintain temperature during defrosting. For meats and other items such as trout or whipped cream, occasionally turn them for even thawing.

### Drying Function:
Utilize fan-assisted shelves to dry items such as mushrooms, apricots, apples, and pears. Food can be left in this setting overnight to achieve optimal results.

### Preserving Function:
Use the heating function for preserving food items in jars with twist-off lids. Ensure there’s enough space between jars to avoid contact. Set the temperature to 100°C for effective preservation without overcrowding. Soft foods like pears, cucumbers, and mushrooms should be processed at this temperature.
