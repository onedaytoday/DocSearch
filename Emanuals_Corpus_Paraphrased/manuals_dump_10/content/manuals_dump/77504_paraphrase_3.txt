Ensure AM/PM settings align correctly and verify that the clock retains accurate time.

**Care and Maintenance**  
To maintain the device, wipe it down with a lint-free cloth. Avoid using aggressive cleaners that could damage the surface. For CD maintenance, use a designated cleaning solution if necessary.
