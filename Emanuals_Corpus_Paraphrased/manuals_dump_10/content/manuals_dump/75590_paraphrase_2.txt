The system comprises coolers operating within a temperature range of -2 to +8°C, featuring substantial insulation thickness and options for built-in or external components. These units incorporate pre-charged cooling mechanisms and require knowledgeable installation. Designed with high-performance, pre-painted polyurethane insulation, they are also free from CFCs and HCFCs. The interior boasts rounded corners for ease of cleaning, and a fast-fit design ensures a tight seal using PVC, compatible with a range of refrigerants and capable of handling ambient temperatures up to +43°C.

Defrosting is managed through a heated system that minimizes frost build-up while enhancing internal lighting (rated IP54). The control panel includes an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting toggle, and an operational thermostat. The door is right-hinged and features smooth rounded cam-lift action hinges to ensure an airtight seal and optimize insulation, thereby reducing energy consumption.
