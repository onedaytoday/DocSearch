The system is composed of coolers operating at temperatures of -2/8°C, featuring various thicknesses and available with built-in or separate options. These three coolers utilize pre-charged cooling mechanisms and are constructed with high-quality materials, including pre-painted insulation, free from CFC and HCFC. The design incorporates rounded internal corners for enhanced safety. The fast-fit installation process enables quick setup, and the PVC used is both airtight and durable.

The coolers are designed to handle ambient temperatures up to +43°C and can utilize refrigerants such as R404A. In terms of performance, the defrosting mechanism operates with heated components to mitigate frost build-up. The installation includes lighting rated at IP54, as well as an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat for efficient operation. The right-hinged doors are equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring reliability and high insulation to optimize energy efficiency while fulfilling HACCP requirements for safety.
