**Drying Guidelines for Fabrics**

When drying items made from extra thick cotton or damp synthetic materials, specify settings for thin items like shirts. Utilize functions such as AUTO SILK, AUTO WOOL, SPECIAL, or DELICATE, and activate the BUZZER feature to indicate when the drying cycle completes. This procedure is crucial for effective drying of varied thicknesses, including terry cloth bathrobes and lightweight knits.

The system allows you to select from multiple drying functions: DRYNESS, DELICATE, BUZZER, and TIME. If the DRYNESS setting is too high, it can be adjusted from MIN to MAX as indicated. In case the incorrect setting is chosen, the AUTO indicator will flash. Should items require a delicate approach, select the DELICATE function to reduce heat.

The BUZZER will sound at the end of the cycle, indicating completion. If necessary, turn off the BUZZER function, or it can be activated or deactivated during the process. 

To begin, press the START/PAUSE button to initiate the drying process, which can be paused or restarted as needed. Once the cycle finishes, the CREASE GUARD phase will activate, helping to reduce wrinkles.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Regular maintenance is essential. Ensure that the unit is cleaned according to the instructions provided, including the heat exchanger and the internal container. Empty all tanks as required to maintain optimal performance and safety.

In the event of malfunction or indicator lights signaling issues, such as an empty water tank, follow troubleshooting steps: check for correct loading, cycle settings, and ensure that the garments are suitable for the selected program.
