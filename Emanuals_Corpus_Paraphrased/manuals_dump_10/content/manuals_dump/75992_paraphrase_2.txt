Use appropriate household cleaners for maintenance. If significant cleaning is required, follow safe disassembly procedures for thorough cleaning.

Maintain the integrity of the glass to prevent shattering, seeking professional service if necessary.

**Replacing the Outer Door Glass**: Use your right hand to hold the glass while aligning it with the screw locations at the top of the door. With your other hand, insert the screws along with washers into their respective holes. Tighten the screws securely using a screwdriver. **Cleaning the Inner Glass Door**: Utilize a clean cloth and a suitable cleaner, avoiding harsh chemicals that may damage the surface. **Cleaning Inside the Oven**: The top surface is coated with Stayclean finish and requires manual cleaning. The back, also featuring Stayclean, should likewise be cleaned by hand. Do not use any cleaners that might damage the Stayclean coating.

**Removing the Wirework Runners**: Begin by unhooking the top shelves from the cavity. **Cleaning the Shelves and Oven Furniture**: Shelves can be cleaned easily if they are not heavily soiled. For intense cleaning, they can be removed and washed with standard dishwashing items or in the dishwasher. **Care for Stayclean Surfaces**: Both the top and back surfaces are treated with Stayclean finish and should be cleaned manually, especially if they become splattered.

**Oven Cleaning Cycle**: Set the cleaning cycle duration, typically for a few hours. **Important Considerations**: The cooling fan will operate during the cleaning cycle, which will switch off when the oven cools down.
