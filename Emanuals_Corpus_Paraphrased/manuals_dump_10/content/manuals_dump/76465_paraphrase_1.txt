#### INSTALLATION

This heater includes essential components, such as the bushing for initial operation, and outlines the installation responsibilities according to applicable technical standards and regulations.

#### WALL MOUNTING PROCEDURE

Ensure you have the necessary screws and brackets for mounting the heater.

**LOCATION:** 

For the EWH-SL/SLN and EWH-R/RN models, the heater can be mounted vertically in a frost-free area within the house, ensuring it is situated above the outlet for easy servicing.

Follow the recommended guidelines for installation and service. The heater’s input and output should be correctly oriented. 

#### HYDRAULIC INSTALLATION

Connect the heater to the plumbing system, ensuring proper fittings on the input and output. The heater must accommodate water expansion when heated, allowing expanded water to flow back into the cold-water feed. 

In the RN and SLN models, the design prevents backflow from the cold-water feed. 

Adjustably position the outlet for optimal flow, rotating clockwise or counterclockwise as needed. 

Verify the heater's operation by testing it with the power and water supply.

#### ELECTRIC INSTALLATION

Electric heaters necessitate correct phase and supply connections. Always follow safety standards and install in accordance with regulations for bathrooms, taking care to maintain safe distances from bathtubs or showers.

**PROHIBITED VOLUME:** 

Maintain a safe distance from potentially splashing water, adhering to specified guidelines for switches and lighting fixtures nearby.

**PROTECTION VOLUME:** 

If the heater is subjected to splashes, ensure that the safety switch is functioning properly. 

When activated, the thermostat controls the heating, adjusting the temperature settings between C and C to optimize the heating process.

#### MAINTENANCE

Clean the heater’s exterior with a cloth. After the warranty period, servicing may be necessary to account for wear and tear.
