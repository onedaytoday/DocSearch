Connecting the ductwork is essential, as demonstrated in the illustrations. Ensure the duct is airtight and secure the assembly with screws as indicated. Uninstall the assembly screws prior to detaching the cover, ensuring the unit is disconnected.

**Warning**: Disable power to the AC unit while performing this procedure. The appliance is equipped with an electrical junction box containing a grounding wire. To prevent electric shock, the green and yellow wire must be connected to the circuit grounding wire in your home; it should never be cut or removed. 

The junction cover complies with UL and CSA standards. Each wire—white for neutral and green/yellow for grounding—must be properly connected as referenced in the cover installation guide.

For mounting the cover, position it at the top and secure it using provided assembly screws. Follow instructions to ensure proper attachment.

**Blower and Lighting Controls**: The control panel allows you to turn the light on or off. Use the designated buttons to manage the light function and monitor status, including countdown features after activation. If no action is taken within seconds, the system will revert to its prior state. 

The clock function can be enabled or adjusted, displaying the hour and seconds, which can also be reset. Maintain the unit's grease filter by washing or replacing it as indicated, typically every thirty operational hours. The unit's charcoal filter should also be cleaned or replaced periodically.

**General Maintenance**: It's recommended to clean the unit regularly to prevent the accumulation of grease and ensure optimal operation. The blower should work effectively to remove heat and smoke during cooking with frequent checks on the surrounding environment.

**Cleaning Instructions**: For cleaning, turn off the lights and allow them to cool down. Only use specified cleaning agents and methods to avoid damage, particularly on painted surfaces and other finishes. 

**Warranty Information**: This appliance is covered by a one-year warranty against defects. It includes provisions for repairs or replacements due to manufacturing issues. However, coverage does not extend to issues arising from misuse or unauthorized service. 

For warranty claims or service inquiries in the USA, contact the authorized service center as provided in the warranty documentation. This document outlines your legal rights, which may vary by state.
