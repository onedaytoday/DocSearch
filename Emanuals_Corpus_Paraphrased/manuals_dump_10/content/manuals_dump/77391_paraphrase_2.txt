# Installation Instructions for Heating and Conditioning Thermostat

### Your Thermostat Replaces
- Typical Models: 1F78H, Heat or Fired Heat, Heat/Cool, Emergency Heat, Water Heat (Three Wire), and more.

### Thermostat Details
**Removing the Old Thermostat**
- Tools Needed: Flat Blade Screwdriver, Wire Cutter/Stripper, Drill with 1/8" Bit (if necessary), Spirit Level (optional).

> **Caution:** Ensure power is turned off to avoid electric shock or damage. 

### Preparations
1. Verify compatibility of your new thermostat with your HVAC system. 
2. Old thermostat removal: detach the wires while labeling them for later connection. Prevent the wires from dropping back into the wall.
3. Carefully pull the cover straight off the base of the old thermostat to avoid damage.
4. Use mounting screws for the new thermostat as per instructions.

### Mounting Instructions
- Attach the new thermostat base using the specified mounting locations.
- Ensure that you're using wall anchors if necessary, especially in areas with insufficient support.

### Wiring Configuration
Follow the cross-reference chart for correct wire connections:
- **Heat Only:** Connect to RH and C terminals.
- **Heat/Cool:** Typically involves additional wires connecting to RC and other terminals.
  
### System Check
1. **Heating Test:**
   - Set the system switch to HEAT. The heater should activate.
2. **Cooling Test:**
   - Set the system switch to COOL. The blower should operate immediately.

### Thermostat Features
- The thermostat includes user controls for adjusting temperature and system settings.
- The configuration menu allows for various settings, including temperature display preference (°F or °C).

### Troubleshooting
**Symptoms & Solutions:**
- **Blown Fuse:** Check and replace if necessary.
- **Heat/Cool Not Functioning:** Ensure the system switch is ON and connected securely.

### Specifications
- Electrical Data: Operates on 24VAC, with specified current limits.
- Thermal Data: Rated for standard residential heating and cooling applications.

Always refer to the manufacturer's website for the latest updates and additional support.

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Symptom: Heating and Cooling Issues

**Corrective Action:**

1. **Adjust Thermostat Settings:** Set the thermostat to "Cool." Ensure that the thermostat and its wiring are securely attached.
   
2. **Check for Service Interruptions:** If the thermostat only clicks in "Heat" or "Cool," inspect for shorted or touching wires.

3. **Switch Power On:** Ensure that the unit is switched to "On" for heat/cool operation.

4. **Verify Thermostat Functionality:** Test whether the thermostat operates correctly. 

5. **Thermostat Location:** Evaluate the thermostat's positioning. If it is too exposed to drafts or direct sunlight, it may inaccurately influence heating and cooling cycles, causing them to activate for shorter durations.

6. **Adjust Settings:** If necessary, follow the instructions to adjust the heating or cooling settings to achieve a more consistent temperature.

7. **Timing Adjustments:** If the heating or cooling cycles are too rapid, consider making adjustments based on operational feedback, aiming to lengthen these cycles for improved comfort.
