To initiate the GRILL function, ensure the door is closed while heating. Foods should be placed appropriately to enable even heating and ensure thorough cooking, taking into account the thickness of the items being prepared. For optimal results, preheat the grill or toaster, adjusting the shelf height as necessary. Always monitor the thermostat to prevent overheating, and switch off the appliance as needed based on the thickness of the food being cooked.

When roasting, ensure that the dish used is heatproof, considering factors like thickness and conductivity, which can influence cooking times and browning. Avoid using overly heavy or colored dishes that could impede cooking quality.

The appliance has an ignition mechanism that should be used responsibly; ensure the igniter is functional before attempting to ignite, and if necessary, use a match while adhering to safety procedures. In case of flame extinguishing, ensure that the appliance is disconnected from the power supply before addressing any issues. 

Proper cleaning is vital to prevent build-up and fire hazards. Before cleaning, always ensure the appliance is switched off and has cooled completely, and disconnect from the electric supply. Use recommended cleaners, avoiding bleach or harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces. 

For maintenance, ensure to clean all components like locking plates and shelves periodically, using appropriate cloths to prevent scratching. If the bulb requires replacement, turn it counterclockwise to remove, ensuring the appliance is disconnected beforehand.

Should any issues arise with the appliance, check the cooking functions, temperature settings, and ensure the power supply is active. If problems persist, refer to the Service Force for assistance.
