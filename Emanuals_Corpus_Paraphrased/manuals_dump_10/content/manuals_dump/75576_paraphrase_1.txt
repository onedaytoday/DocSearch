The refrigeration system is designed with coolers featuring a thickness suitable for temperatures between -10°C and -21°C. These units come equipped with integrated components for efficient assembly and installation, utilizing pre-charged cooling systems. They employ new injection technology to enhance performance and are insulated with high-quality, prepainted polyurethane. The system is free from CFC and HCFC, with rounded internal corners for easy cleaning.

The fast-fit design enables straightforward installation, ensuring airtight seals made from durable PVC, suitable for both high and low ambient conditions (up to +43°C) while using R404A refrigerant. The performance is optimized through a defrosting mechanism that incorporates heated elements to minimize ice buildup. The control panel includes an ON/OFF switch, a lighting switch, and a thermostat.

Additionally, the cooler comes with a right-hinged door that features smooth, rounded edges, providing excellent insulation to reduce energy consumption. It complies with HACCP standards for food safety.

Technical specifications include various models and dimensions, along with optional accessories such as aluminum shelves and a temperature recording kit. The available equipment includes a printer for HACCP documentation and a plastic curtain designed for a door clearance of 65 cm.
