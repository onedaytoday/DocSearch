**SNOOZE Functionality:** To use the SNOOZE feature, press the SLEEP button, which will allow the device to turn off automatically after a set amount of time. You can adjust the duration of the SLEEP function by changing the settings.

**Lithium Battery Replacement:** The lithium battery may eventually need to be replaced. The lifespan can vary based on several factors, including usage patterns. To ensure continued operation, keep the clock connected to an AC outlet; this will provide a fresh battery supply for at least five years. If the LOW BATT warning appears, replace with a 3V CR2430 lithium battery. Handle the battery and internal components carefully, ensuring not to misplace any screws during replacement.
