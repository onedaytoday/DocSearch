The system features coolers designed to operate between -2°C and +8°C, constructed with insulation thickness and options for built-in or external components. These four coolers come equipped with pre-charged refrigeration systems and a construction that requires assembly knowledge for installation. They utilize new injection techniques to enhance performance and are insulated with high-density, pre-painted polyurethane, ensuring they are free from CFC and HCFC substances. The interior features rounded corners and a fast-fit design, promoting airtight installation with PVC and other materials.

The units can withstand temperatures up to +43°C and use refrigerants R404A, incorporating high and low-pressure settings. The defrosting system employs heated elements to minimize frost build-up, and the internal lighting, rated IP54, enhances visibility. Key components include an ON/OFF switch, an internal light switch, an operating thermostat, and right-hinged doors constructed with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring airtight integrity and high insulation. This design optimizes efficiency and allows for easy temperature checks as per HACCP regulations.
