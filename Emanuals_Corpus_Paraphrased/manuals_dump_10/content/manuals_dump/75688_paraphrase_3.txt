**Chiller Overview**

Chillers are designed to cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively reducing bacterial growth. The chilling process lowers the temperature without compromising food quality and enhances food safety. Chillers feature all-around performance capabilities and may incorporate built-in systems.

**Operating Modes**  
The chillers offer various operating modes:
- Soft Chilling at +2°C  
- Standard Chilling at +12°C  
The ARTE model can be activated to cool food down to +3°C continuously, facilitating the insertion of food. The units come equipped with built-in UV systems and defrosting capabilities. The displays provide countdowns and service information (P1, P2), allowing for monitoring and recording operational data, including HACCP compliance, even during abnormal terminations.

**Performance**  
Efficiency is based on the type of food and the specific chilling category (NF designation).

**Construction and Finishing**  
The chillers are constructed from AISI stainless steel and feature high-density polyurethane insulation that is HCFC-free. They comply with ISO standards and are designed with rounded corners and protection rated IP20.
