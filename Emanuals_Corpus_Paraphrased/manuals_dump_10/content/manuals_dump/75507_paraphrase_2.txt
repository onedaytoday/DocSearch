## Instructions for SLIP-IN D/O Cooker

### Introduction
This document provides guidelines in accordance with British Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It is essential to read this manual thoroughly to ensure proper usage of the cooker. The cooker is designed primarily for cooking food. Ensure that you follow all instructions accurately.

### Lighting the Hotplate
To ignite the hotplate, press the appropriate button while turning it to the highest setting, then release it immediately. Warning: If a flame spreads, turn off the cooker immediately to prevent further spread. 

Ensure the hotplate is turned off after use. 

### Cooking Guidelines
Regularly monitor the food while cooking. Use the high setting for quick tasks like toasting, and adjust accordingly for thicker items. 

Make sure to use the right shelf for different food thicknesses, positioning larger cuts towards the center for even heat.

### Preheating
Preheat the oven before cooking, positioning food in accordance with recommended guidelines. Different types of food may require various heating strategies, adjusting based on their individual needs.

### Roasting
When roasting, avoid covering the meat as this can impede proper heat circulation. Monitor the cooking process to ensure even cooking.

### Cooking Charts
Refer to the cooking chart for specific instructions regarding various food items, including recommended shelf positions and cooking times.

### General Cooking Tips
For maximum efficiency, cook tougher cuts of meat using slower methods. Ensure food reaches the recommended internal temperature and check if meat is fully thawed before starting the cooking process. Reheat food safely, and avoid reheating multiple times to maintain quality. 

This guide is intended to facilitate safe and effective use of the cooker while optimizing food preparation processes.

Consistent cleaning is essential for maintaining the appliance, particularly to eliminate food spills and residue from polishes and cleaners. Use only recommended cleaning agents. If using a dishwasher, refer to the operating manual. Clean surfaces with a suitable cloth to avoid burns. Ensure that the hotplate is kept in optimal condition; if food gets burnt onto it, clean it promptly. For effective maintenance of the crowns, ensure that they remain free of food debris and can move freely. If they become burnt or soiled, clean them using an appropriate scouring pad to restore their condition.

To clean the exterior of the oven, follow installation guidance, ensuring that all screws are secured for safety. Make sure to cool down before servicing. Avoid using chemical bleaches or corrosive products, as they may damage the surface. Should any damages occur, consult a service professional per the manufacturer's guidance.

Positioning of the appliance is critical; keep it away from flammable materials. Follow height and depth specifications to maintain proper functioning. Ensure food covers are secure when in use.

For regular servicing, refer to customer support when issues arise. Consumers in Ireland can find assistance through local directories.

### GAS CONNECTION

When connecting to the gas supply, ensure that only liquid sealants are used where the inlet gas pipe is attached to the reset valve (avoid using P.T.F.E. sealant tape). Make certain that the gas supply is properly aligned with the specified R/8 B.S.P. threaded connection located below the hotplate. 

**Important:** The flexible tubing used must conform to the latest BS regulations. LPG flexible connections should be designed specifically for LPG use and must be capable of operation up to specified pressure. They should also feature a red stripe, band, or label for identification purposes.

### BATTERY INSTALLATION 

The battery is placed in the compartment on the front plinth. To access the battery, remove the front panel as shown. Insert the AA battery into the right-hand side, ensuring correct orientation. Additional tools may be required for this process.

### PRESSURE TESTING 

Perform a pressure test by checking the connections from both the front and back covers. Carefully ease the cover off to expose the FSD phial. Turn on the gas supply and adjust the thermostat to ignite the hotplate. Observe the flame to ensure proper ignition and operation.

### GRILL CHECK 

Activate the grill and observe that it lights correctly. Adjust as necessary until the flame stabilizes.

### HOTPLATE CHECK

Inspect the hotplate crowns to ensure they are correctly positioned. Turn on the hotplate and confirm that the flames are consistent.

### LID CUT-OFF DEVICE CHECK 

Activate the lid cut-off device. The hotplate should have gas supply when in use, and the supply must be disabled when the lid is closed.

### MAIN OVEN CHECK 

Adjust the thermostat and ensure that the flame ignites properly. Verify that the FSD is functioning; it should allow gas flow when heated.

### SECOND OVEN CHECK 

Turn the thermostat counterclockwise and confirm that the flame ignites as expected. The FSD must bypass properly and allow gas to flow only when it is heated.

### GENERAL NOTE 

Refer to the additional documentation for details regarding operation and maintenance, including information specific to the RENOWN D/O SLIP-IN model.
