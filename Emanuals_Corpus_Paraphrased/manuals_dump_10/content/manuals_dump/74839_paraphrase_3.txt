#### Gas Connection
Gas installations must only be carried out by a qualified technician. Ensure all connections conform to the identified installation standards, testing the service plate for compatibility. 

#### Operating Instructions
Follow these steps during operation:
- **Igniting the Pilot Burner**: Hold the knob and turn clockwise until the pilot ignites. 
- **Main Burner Activation**: Adjust settings and turn anti-clockwise to ignite the main burner, ensuring the correct temperature range is achieved.

**Temperature Settings**: Adjust the thermostat from a minimum of 180째F to a maximum of 360째F, keeping in mind operational efficiency.

### Safety Precautions
Always follow safety protocols to prevent overheating and fire hazards. Ensure the unit is adequately monitored during use to minimize risks. 

This guide must be adhered to for safe and efficient appliance operation and maintenance. For any issues or repairs, contact authorized service personnel.

### Main Burner Shutdown Procedures

To turn off the oven's main burner, rotate the back knob clockwise from the highest setting to the off position. This will extinguish the flame and cut off the gas supply. Ensure this is done only after the heating element has cooled down. 

For the pilot burner flame, press the knob gently and turn it clockwise from the "on" position to extinguish the flame. 

### Oil Care

After use, switch the oil system off and ensure it cools down completely. Remove the oil drain cock to collect used oil. Clean the oil bath and the filter, and replace the cover securely.

### Changing the Frying Oil

To change the frying oil, follow these steps: first, turn off the system and allow the trough to cool. Then, open the drain cock to release the used oil without any obstructions.

### Cleaning 

The oil trough should be cleaned after each use. Ensure the system is turned off and the oil has cooled before cleaning. Wipe down the trough and clean the strainers thoroughly with a clean cloth. Use appropriate cleaning solutions on the exterior, avoiding high-pressure cleaners which could damage the unit.

### Gas Burner Maintenance

If the burner flame appears yellow or deviates from proper operation, check for blockages or dirt in the outlets, which can lead to backfires. It's essential to adhere to proper ignition procedures and maintain cleanliness.

### Shutdown Procedures

When shutting down, close the gas supply and clean the trough, applying a thin layer of protective coating. Ensure all components are maintained regularly.

### Malfunction Indicators

Malfunctions may occur if the system overheats, causing the STB to trip. If the flames flash back, check for high gas velocity or defective thermostats. Report any persistent issues to customer service for further evaluation.

### General Instructions

Always follow safety and operation guidelines as per ANSI standards. Any service performed must comply with specific regulations concerning installation and use.

### Technical Data

Check technical specifications regularly. During installation, ensure proper connections to gas systems and maintain compliance with safety protocols.

### Operating Instructions

The fryer operates within a temperature range of 150째C to 360째F. Ensure to follow the necessary procedures for oil treatment and maintenance.
