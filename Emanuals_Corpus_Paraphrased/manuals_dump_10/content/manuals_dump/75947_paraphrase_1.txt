### COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Functions

**COOLMATIC Feature**  
The COOLMATIC function is activated to initiate cooling, indicated by a yellow light. The function maintains a set temperature, ensuring the contents remain crucially cool for a specified number of hours. To manually engage or disengage the COOLMATIC, press the corresponding button.

**FROSTMATIC Feature**  
The FROSTMATIC function is designed for rapid freezing of fresh food, preventing degradation and ensuring optimal freshness. Activation is indicated by a yellow light, similar to the COOLMATIC feature. To manually control this function, use the dedicated FROSTMATIC button. Note that if the FROSTMATIC is turned off manually, it will reset after a number of hours.

**Switching the Appliance On/Off**  
To turn off the device, simultaneously hold both ON/OFF buttons for a few seconds. This triggers a countdown for the appliance to shut down. If the device loses power, both functions will remain off until reset. To restore operation, hold both buttons again for a few seconds.

**Storage Guidance**  
To maintain the quality of stored food, ensure the door is securely closed to prevent spoilage and potential mold formation. Regular maintenance includes cleaning and monitoring the temperature levels for optimal preservation.

**Shelving Adjustments**  
The shelves are adjustable in height, allowing for flexible storage solutions. Position items according to size, placing taller items at the back. For bottles, ensure they are secured upright for stability.

**Temperature Monitoring**  
Use a thermometer to regularly check temperatures, especially for perishable items like meat which should be stored at appropriate levels—ideally below 4°C. Further guidance is available from food safety resources.

**Food Storage Recommendations**  
Store foods with care, covering them to avoid contamination. Pay attention to capacity limits of the storage compartments to maintain efficient cooling.

In the event of frost buildup, it is crucial for customers to contact AEG Service Force if they experience mechanical issues or breakdowns. The cooling system functions by transferring heat from food or other items, meaning warmth accumulates within the unit. This heat is then expelled into the environment, allowing the system to cool effectively. 

The heater is integrated into the appliance and is typically mounted at the rear. Its design facilitates the dissipation of heat in compliance with relevant regulations governing household appliances (GSG) and safety standards (VBG, VDE). AEG products meet EU directives 73/23/EWG (February) and 89/336/EWG (including 92/31/EWG) regarding electromagnetic compatibility.

AEG offers a warranty to the original purchaser, which lasts for several months from the date of purchase. This warranty covers defects in materials or workmanship but does not extend to unauthorized repairs or installations, as outlined in the terms. Should repairs be necessary, customers must inform AEG Service Force or an authorized AEG service provider. Any repairs carried out become the property of AEG.

If customers move to another country within the European Community (EC) after the initial purchase, the warranty will still apply according to the respective regulations in that country. For assistance or inquiries related to AEG products, customers should reach out via the provided channels, including the AEG website or direct contact information.

For specific product information, including the Product Number Code (PNC), customers are advised to check the rating plate located on the appliance.
