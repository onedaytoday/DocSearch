### Normal Operating Sounds

When in operation, the appliance generates specific sounds, including a whirring noise from the cooling system and sounds from the thermostat, especially when it activates. These normal sounds indicate that the appliance is functioning correctly. Proper food placement is essential; ensure items are not obstructing airflow, as this can hinder performance. Uncovered food can impact temperature regulation, so it’s advisable to keep food adequately covered.

### Defrosting

Frost buildup occurs naturally and may need to be addressed when the appliance cycles off. Thawing frost can collect in various areas, and maintenance may be necessary. Always disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning agents, avoiding bleach or abrasive products, which can damage surfaces. Keeping the appliance exterior clean is crucial to maintain optimal cooling performance.

### Light Maintenance

To prevent electric shock while changing the light bulb, ensure the light switch is turned off. Specifications for the bulb should match the appliance requirements. To access the bulb, remove the light cover and unscrew it safely. 

### Troubleshooting

Should any operational issues arise, like excessive frost or malfunctioning lights, it may indicate a performance problem. Ensure the door seals are intact and that air can circulate freely around food stored inside.
