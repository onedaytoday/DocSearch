#### Getting Started

To set up the amplifier, connect it to a grounded outlet using the provided CE cord. Ensure the connections to the outputs are secure to prevent sound issues.

Use the footswitch to toggle between channels, affecting both sound quality and EQ effectiveness. For cleaner tones, keep the EQ settings below the 12 o'clock position, and adjust according to your preference. When activated, the channels offer a range of sounds from light to heavy distortion, enhancing your overall playing experience.

The M90 MODENA's master volume and footswitch interaction allow for tailored sound adjustments. Ensure the settings are balanced to avoid any distortion or feedback that might disrupt performance.

#### Rear Panel Configuration

On the back of the M90, you'll find cooling vents that help dissipate heat generated during operation. The Edge controls can be adjusted to modify the tonal qualities of your sound, while the F/X loop is designed to accommodate various effects when connected. Proper usage enhances the amplifier's versatility, allowing for creative sound exploration without compromising audio fidelity.
