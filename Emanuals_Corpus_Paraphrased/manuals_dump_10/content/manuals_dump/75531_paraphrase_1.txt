Here’s a more technical paraphrase of your text while maintaining its original meaning:

**Installation Guidelines:**

Adjust the positioning by measuring from the front to the back and the top of the cooker to determine the ideal shelf location. Use the adjustment knobs at the front to raise or lower the cooker by turning them clockwise or counterclockwise, respectively. Ensure the wheels support the installation, attaching screws through the front of the plinth. Rotate the screws to adjust height accordingly. The plinth cover must fit snugly with the cooker.

**Electrical Connection Warning:** Ensure that the appliance is correctly earthed. Access the internal screw responsible for grounding the wires. Safely route the wires through the cover, making sure that the locking mechanism allows the cover to be easily removed without causing any twisting. Confirm the connections for the brown (live), black (neutral), and earth wires.

**Gas Supply Connection:** The gas connection should be made to the ISO internal thread located at the top right of the rear. Ensure compatibility with the hose specifications, which should meet BS standards and be rated for temperatures exceeding 70°C. For LP gas, ensure compatibility with the correct type and color-coded hoses being used. Check the integrity of the gas supply and the injector before commissioning.

**Aeration and Specifications:** For models II 2H3+*, determine the type of gas supplied (G20, G30, G31) and the recommended power supply of 240V. Specify installation requirements for operation in GB and IE.
