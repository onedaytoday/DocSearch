Once the round bracket is secured to the wall, the cooker should be positioned slightly higher than indicated on the template. Ensure that the screws align correctly, with the front of the unit facing outward. Each screw must be fastened to the wall using the provided security screws to enhance stability.

The assembly height should conform to the specified guidelines on the template, while also ensuring the release catch is accessible. To install, match the screws indicated on the template with the top of the cooker; the correct placement will ensure a seamless fit.

After installation, attach the front panel to the cooker, ensuring it functions correctly when closed. In the case of significant weight on the panel, verify the screw connections to maintain a secure closure through friction assembly. Adjust the screws slightly, turning them clockwise, to achieve a smooth operation.
