**Chiller Operation and Features**

The chiller efficiently cools cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly reducing bacterial levels within four hours, and can further drop the temperature to -18°C. This process enhances food safety and quality by minimizing the risk of spoilage. Designed with comprehensive features, the chiller excels in performance.

**Operating Modes**

The chiller includes various operational modes like Soft Chilling at 2°C and standard Chilling at 20°C. It continuously monitors the cooling effectiveness during food insertion. Additionally, it is equipped with built-in defrosting functions and offers a countdown timer along with service information displays (P1, P2) that record operational data and HACCP compliance, even in the event of abnormal terminations.

**Performance Standards**

Compliance with NF regulations ensures effective chilling according to food type.

**Construction and Finishing**

Constructed from AISI stainless steel with high-density, HCFC-free polyurethane insulation, this unit meets stringent ISO standards. It features rounded corners for safety and is protected by an IP20 rating.
