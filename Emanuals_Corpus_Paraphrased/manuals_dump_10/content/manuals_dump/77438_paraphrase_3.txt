**AC Operation**: The device operates on AC power using a 6V adapter included with the unit, which plugs into a 120V AC outlet. Alternatively, it can use DC power (6V). Note that using DC power makes the AC adapter redundant.

**Caution**: Always disconnect the AC adapter from the outlet by grasping the plug, not the cord. Avoid exposing the AC adapter to moisture.

**Note**: Purchase AC adapters separately.

**Battery Precautions**: Follow these guidelines for battery installation. Ensure the correct polarity is observed as indicated. When replacing batteries, use the same type and do not mix new and old batteries. Rechargeable batteries must not be recharged when they are not designed for it, as they may overheat.
