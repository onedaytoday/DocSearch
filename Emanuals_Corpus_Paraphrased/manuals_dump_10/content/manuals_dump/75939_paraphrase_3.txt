### Automatic Defrosting

The defrosting mechanism activates automatically when frost builds up on the unit or when it's powered off. Thawed frost collects at the base, where it evaporates. The defrosting process is essential, particularly when frost becomes thick; it is advisable to defrost at least once every few months to avoid quality issues with food. 

**Warning!** Do not use heating elements or mechanical devices that are not specified in the operating instructions, as they may pose health risks or damage the plastics. The defrosting switch may require several hours; ensure food is covered to keep it cool, and do not place items directly in front of the appliance to avoid obstructing airflow.

### Cleaning Instructions

**Caution!** Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the power supply. Avoid using strong cleaning agents, bleach, or solvents on plastic parts to prevent damage. If the appliance needs extensive cleaning, please allow several hours for it to cool down.

Cleaning should be conducted with care. After covering shelves with paper, switch off the appliance to facilitate this process. Regular maintenance is recommended to avoid buildup that may hinder operation, ideally once a year.

**Light Replacement Procedure:**
Switch off the unit and remove the light cover by unscrewing it. Follow safety specifications (e.g., voltage and wattage) indicated on the appliance.
