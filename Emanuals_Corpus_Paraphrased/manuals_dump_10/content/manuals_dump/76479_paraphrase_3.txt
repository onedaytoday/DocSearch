**IMPORTANT: READ AND SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS**

These operating instructions are essential for proper use and safety. Please ensure you read them thoroughly and keep a record of the details provided below.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS:**

Before using this refrigerator, read all instructions carefully. Children should not be left unattended near the appliance, and any packaging materials should be disposed of safely to prevent suffocation hazards. If the refrigerator is unpacked, ensure that all items that could pose a risk are properly stored away.

**ELECTRICAL INFORMATION:**

For safety, ensure the unit is correctly grounded using a three-prong outlet to prevent electrical shock. The refrigerator should be plugged directly into a wall outlet. In case of any electrical issues, switch off the outlet or unplug the cord carefully.

**INSTALLATION:**

Position the refrigerator in a location where it is adequately grounded and within temperature limits, specifically between 0°C - 32°C (32°F - 90°F), allowing for at least an inch of space around it for ventilation. Ensure it is level for optimal performance; a tilted unit can lead to cooling issues or frost build-up.

**FIRST STEPS:**

Remove all packing materials, including screws and bases, from the front to the rear of the appliance. 

**CLEANING:**

Only use non-abrasive cleaning agents on both the interior and exterior surfaces to avoid damaging the finish. 

**DOOR REMOVAL:**

If you need to remove the door, carefully unscrew the hinges at the top and bottom. Utilize a screwdriver to detach the door from the appliance.

**ENERGY SAVING TIPS:**

To enhance energy efficiency, minimize exposure to sunlight and heat sources. Avoid overcrowding shelves and securely cover food items to reduce energy consumption.

**SETTING THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL:**

Initially, allow the refrigerator to cool down for a few hours. The factory setting is typically satisfactory, but you can adjust it to achieve your desired temperature. 

**REFRIGERATOR FEATURES:**

This unit includes an interior light that activates when the door is opened. Shelves are adjustable for added convenience.

**CARE AND CLEANING:**

Regularly clean the interior with mild soap and water. A clean, soft cloth should be used for the exterior.
