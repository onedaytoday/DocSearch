**INSTRUCTION MANUAL**

**Models: WRM2000_A-R, WRM2800_A-R, WRM3500_A-R**

This manual provides important information about the operation and maintenance of your refrigerator models WRM2000_A-R, WRM2800_A-R, and WRM3500_A-R for years to come.

Ensure that the refrigerator is slightly higher at the front than at the back for optimal performance. It is essential to position the appliance away from direct sunlight and heat sources, and connect it to a dedicated power outlet (230V AC). Ensure that the ground wire (green/yellow) is securely attached to the back.

Thoroughly clean the interior and exterior with a soft cloth. Set the thermostat to the appropriate temperature and allow the unit to stabilize. If frost accumulates, it should be removed gently. Ensure the ice cubes are accessible for easy removal, and rotate the thermostat to the warmer setting as necessary.

For fresh food storage, place items in the compartment without overcrowding. Wrap perishable items in airtight containers or plastic to maintain freshness.

Regularly defrost the unit to prevent excessive frost buildup, especially if the temperature is high or the unit is frequently accessed. Frost thicker than Â¼ inch should be removed; use a scraper if necessary. In the defrosting process for model WRM3500_A-R, detach the drain cap as directed, and replace it after defrosting.

Keep the interior clean and free from food particles. A damp cloth can be used for cleaning, and perform this maintenance at least once a month. Any signs of wear or scratching should be addressed to avoid operational issues. Moreover, appliances should be kept at a safe distance from flammable materials.

If the appliance is not cooling effectively or shows any malfunctioning signs, contact customer service or the retailer where it was purchased for assistance. 

For optimal performance, ensure the unit remains free of obstructions, particularly around the back where airflow is crucial. If issues persist, consult the relevant service documentation for further troubleshooting steps.
