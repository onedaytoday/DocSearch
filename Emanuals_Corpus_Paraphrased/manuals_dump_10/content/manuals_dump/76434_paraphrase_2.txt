**DRYING INSTRUCTIONS**

**Caution**: Only use the drying function for recommended cotton and synthetic fabrics. Ensure items are classified correctly before selecting the drying mode (Coton, Synthetic, Wool). If items become too creased, utilize the pressing function.

**Drying Process**: The dryer operates continuously through various phases, including an active drying phase where sounds indicate progression. If the drying mode needs to be altered, simply switch it off at any stage.

**Sorting Laundry**: Organize laundry by color and fabric type: whites, colors, synthetics, and cottons. Wash new items separately. This includes pillowcases, towels, and synthetic materials, which should be treated according to guideline charts to avoid damage.

**Stain Removal**: For tough stains, pre-treat them overnight with a cloth soaked in an appropriate cleaning solution. Use bleach carefully—only on whites and colorfast items when necessary.

**Dryer Specifications**: Items like synthetics can attract lint, particularly when drying is finished. Ensure proper maintenance of the lint filter and drying hose. Select appropriate drying settings based on your garments’ care labels.

**Washing Programs**: Utilize specific washing programs for different fabric types, like reduced cycles for delicate items, or prewash features for heavily soiled fabrics. The options also include additional rinses for thoroughly cleaned clothes.

**Maintenance**: Regularly inspect cleaning components and ensure no blockages exist in hoses or filters. Follow safety precautions when handling the dryer, and disconnect from power prior to any maintenance tasks.

**Emergency Protocols**: In case of a malfunction, follow specific instructions for manual emptying and cleaning. Always ensure power is off before attempting any repairs or maintenance.

These guidelines fundamentally ensure the correct operation and maintenance of your dryer, enhancing its performance and longevity.
