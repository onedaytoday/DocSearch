### Installation Instructions

#### General Safety Information

Ensure installation complies with NFPA 54, maintaining appropriate clearances around the service areas and combustion sections of the heater, particularly at the rear. Consider installing the Mantis High-Efficiency Heater in a recessed area or corner, providing sufficient access for servicing, especially from the rear.

**Specifications:**
- **Model:** PV28SV50 (BTU/HR: 50,000; KW/H: 14.6)
- **Electrical Connection:** 120VAC, 60Hz, 5A
- Installations must allow room for inspection and service to adhere to warranty requirements. Clearances from combustibles are crucial, maintaining safety and operational integrity.

#### Clearances for Direct Vent and Single Flue Installations

Select installation locations that meet clearance requirements for proper function and service access. For direct vent and single flue systems, ensure a minimum distance from combustible materials and surfaces. 

**Warnings:**
- Avoid installing the heater on carpet or other flammable materials.
- Use protective barriers made of thick, light-colored materials where necessary.

#### Specifications for Surrounds and Venting

- **Required Parts:**
  - PVC Cord #PVVK-SH
  - Surround #PVE-1
  - Top Short #PV4H
  - Top #PV2H

Make sure the heater can be serviced adequately with access to all components without obstructions. Clearances must be maintained to ensure safety and functionality.

#### Venting Requirements

Utilize specified venting kits and ensure correct alignment with the heater and building structure. Incorporate flexible PVC pipes when necessary and ensure all connections are secure. The PVC vent components should be properly connected and sealed to avoid leaks.

**Installation:**
- Follow venting diagrams for collinear direct venting configurations.
- Use specified termination caps and comply with local building codes.

**Additional Installation Notes:**
- When installing trim or surround kits, adjust framing dimensions accordingly.
- Ensure proper positioning of the log set in the heater to prevent operational issues.

Keep safety and compliance in mind during installation for optimal performance and reliability.

**PVVTC Termination Cap Vent Kit Installation by Comfort Inc.**

The PVVTC Termination Cap Vent Kit features PVC installation and is designed to integrate with the PVCT plate. Follow the PVC cement termination instructions carefully. If opting for the PVVTC cap model, order the compatible PVC cement and transition plate separately.

Mount the plate securely using four screws, ensuring the installation height aligns with specifications. The PVC application requires accurate length adjustments, adhering to the guidelines provided.

For installation of the Colinear Transition Vent Kit, ensure air intake components such as P-traps or elbows are supplied by the installer. Maintain a minimum height as specified and use outdoor-grade sealant where required.

**Direct Vent Installation Guidelines**

For direct vent system installation, pay particular attention to serviceability. The mantel bracket should not be glued at this point. Connect the gas supply from the PVVK-24H or PVVK-48H models, ensuring the exhaust opening is pointed downward as per construction specifications.

Protect the floor with a thick, light-colored material unless a hearth is present. The minimum flue center height and placement are also critical to conforming with local code and ensuring safe operation.

**Gas Connection Guidelines**

When installing the gas supply line to the heater, route the hose for easy access for servicing. Incorporate a flexible gas line to facilitate inspection and maintenance.

**Operating Instructions Checklist**

Prior to operating the appliance, review the provided checklist to ensure compliance with safety and operational guidelines. Disconnect the gas supply if any issues arise or if the heater does not function correctly, and contact a service technician if needed.

**Lighting Instructions**

If you detect a gas smell, do not attempt to light the heater. Evacuate the area and notify neighbors. Shut off the gas supply and follow emergency instructions. 

Always confirm the thermostat and switches are in the correct positions as per the operating instructions before igniting the burner.

**Shutdown Procedures**

To turn off the heater, switch off the gas supply and allow for adequate cooling before disconnecting any components. 

**Conversion Instructions**

For conversion between LP propane and natural gas, ensure the correct procedures are followed, including turning off the gas supply and making necessary adjustments to the front bushing and orifices.

Always consult a qualified service technician for conversions to ensure compliance with safety regulations.

The heater's performance is influenced by various factors, including the type and height of the heater, which can affect the hissing noise heard when the device operates. This sound typically lasts from several seconds and correlates with the LED light (43B) on the front panel, which illuminates during operation before turning off. The Mantis heater operates using combustion, converting the heat generated from burnt fuel, with exhaust managed through the rear. The system recycles this exhaust, contributing to efficient heating.

The FRBTP, FRBTC, and TRW Battery Operated Remote Thermostats facilitate remote control of the heater. All devices should be referenced in the installation documentation left with the owner. Proper wiring of the thermostats involves a schematic that clearly defines the connections for different components, with attention to polarity.

For installation, ensure that you follow electrical safety standards compliant with ANSI/NFPA or CSA C22.1, grounding the unit properly with a three-prong connection to prevent shock hazards. The wiring diagram outlines the connections for the heater's operation, including various pins and their functions, along with specific cautionary notes regarding operational testing.

The Mantis heater is designed with a high-efficiency feature that switches off if it overheats, with a trigger set at 80°C (176°F). It allows for cooldown periods before restarting to avoid damage. Regular inspections and maintenance are recommended, particularly before heating seasons, to ensure safe and efficient performance.

Cleaning should be done periodically using appropriate methods, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the unit. Assembly maintenance requires careful handling, with components like the HSI Blower needing to be accessed and cleaned properly.

Authorized personnel must carry out any installation or service work to mitigate common issues such as improper gas pressure, incorrect log placement, or faulty installations, which can cause failures in system operation. If the heater malfunctions or overheats, users should follow outlined troubleshooting steps, including checking the operational status of the LED indicators. Regular monitoring and adherence to the installation guidelines will ensure optimal functional performance.

The heater requires regular inspection and maintenance to ensure optimal performance. It’s essential to check the heater’s heating elements annually to prevent buildup and maintain efficiency. Follow installation instructions carefully for the surround assembly using the provided screws. Proper clearance around the heater is necessary for effective airflow. 

Before servicing, always disconnect the main power to avoid hazards. 

**Installation Notes:**

- The optional pedestal assembly should be secured to the heater using screws and washers for stability.
- Ensure proper attachment to prevent damage to the heater’s finish.

**Parts Overview:**

Please note that various parts are crucial for maintaining the heater's functionality, including:

- Combustion air deflector
- Heat exchanger assembly
- Burner assemblies for different gas types
