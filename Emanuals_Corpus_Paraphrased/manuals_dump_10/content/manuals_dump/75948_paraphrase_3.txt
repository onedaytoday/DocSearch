**COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Functions**

The COOLMATIC function is designed to rapidly cool food. When activated, the COOLMATIC light illuminates to indicate its operation. This function maintains the desired cooling temperature for a set duration, after which the system reverts to the previously selected temperature. The actual temperature is displayed on the unit, and the function can also be operated manually.

The FROSTMATIC function is aimed at freezing fresh food products effectively, while also safeguarding items already in the freezer. Activation of the FROSTMATIC mode is indicated by a light, which can also be turned off manually.

**Operating the Appliance**

To turn off the appliance, press the ON/OFF button. A countdown timer will display, and once complete, the appliance will shut down, with the light turning off. Should there be an interruption to the power supply, the appliance remains disconnected from electricity. In case of any operational issues, the ON/OFF button can be pressed and held to reset functions. For defrosting and cleaning, follow the specified guidelines.

Ensure that the refrigerator door remains closed to prevent cooling loss and possible mold growth. Regularly clean the interior to maintain hygiene.

**Temperature Management**

To adjust the temperature, use the (WARMER) or (COLDER) buttons. The display will indicate the current temperature, and adjustments should be made according to desired food preservation needs. For specific items like meat, it's recommended to maintain temperatures on lower shelves, as warmer air rises.

Always cover food items to avoid cross-contamination and retain freshness.

**Food Storage Recommendations**

Be mindful of the quantity of fresh food being stored, adhering to specified limits. For optimal preservation, use the FROSTMATIC function as needed, recognizing the necessity to avoid overcrowding to ensure proper airflow.

**Ice Cube Preparation and Defrosting**

Prepare ice cubes by filling trays and allowing them to freeze completely. For defrosting, remove any frost buildup regularly to maintain efficiency. Defrosting should typically occur at least once a year or whenever frost exceeds a certain thickness.

**General Cleaning and Maintenance**

When cleaning the appliance, always disconnect it from the power supply. Use non-abrasive household cleaners and avoid strong chemicals that could damage surfaces or present health risks. Regular upkeep, including cleaning the condenser and other parts, can enhance performance.

In summary, the operations outlined ensure effective food preservation and maintenance of appliance performance. Always refer to detailed guidelines for specific processes and safety measures.

**Service Notifications and Appliance Cooling Issues**

If your appliance emits a warning tone or displays flashing lights, this indicates that the cooling temperature is too high. Additionally, if water pooling or other functionality issues arise, the indicator light may turn off. 

In instances where the temperature drops excessively low, take immediate action. Contact AEG Service Force if you observe a constant warning signal or hear unusual sounds. This may suggest a mechanical failure or need for servicing. Adhere to the regulations set forth in recent legislation concerning household appliances (GSG, VBG, VDE), which govern the safe operation of such equipment.

Ensure the appliance's heating elements are functioning properly and not obstructed. The cooling cycle is essential for maintaining food safety and should not be hindered by improper sealing or placement.
