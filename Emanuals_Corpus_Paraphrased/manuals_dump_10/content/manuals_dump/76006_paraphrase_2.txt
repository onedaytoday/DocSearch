**Caution:** If the equipment becomes worn, ensure proper assembly and follow all mounting instructions provided in the chapter. Always wear the recommended protective gear. **Important:** Do not operate the brush cutter if the specific safety guard for the cutting device is not securely attached. Failing to adhere to these precautions can lead to serious injuries from the rotating components.

When engaging in maintenance tasks, ensure the equipment is turned off to prevent burns and injuries. Before use, inspect the brush cutter, including the head and casing, for wear and damage. Replace any worn parts as necessary.
