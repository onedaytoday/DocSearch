The LW GN platform merges tradition with research to enhance creativity in professional kitchens, offering a versatile cooking experience through its cook & chill system, complemented by chillers and freezers designed for specific operational needs. The GN OPERATING MODES feature three distinct cooking and cleaning options tailored to various food types and operator requirements. For instance, the LTC mode focuses on optimal cooking for meats, while the reheating function allows for efficient warming of products. Proofing capabilities take advantage of innovative cooking technologies.

The main features include traditional convection cooking suitable for products that require low humidity, as well as steam cooking at varying temperatures (25-99°C, 100°C, or 100-130°C) that combine convected heat with controlled humidity for enhanced food quality. The bi-functional air-o-clean system ensures seamless cleaning and precision in food preparation.

Additionally, the equipment is designed to support HACCP protocols, capturing cooking data through USB connectivity. The construction features thermo-glazed cooking chambers for optimal heat retention and security, with IPX5 water protection and built-in lighting for improved visibility during the cooking process.

Notable accessories include various GN-sized trays, filters, and cleaning components, as well as integrated HACCP systems for compliance. The manual includes diagrams for installation and operation, emphasizing the versatility and efficiency of the LW GN system in modern kitchen environments.
