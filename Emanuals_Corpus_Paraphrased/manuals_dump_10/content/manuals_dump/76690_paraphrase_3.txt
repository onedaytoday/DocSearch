To ensure secure mounting, the projector screen should be installed so it remains stable when retracted or deployed. Carefully select the mounting location on the wall and ensure that the screws are placed about an inch from the designated mounting points. The back of the mounting bracket is designed to align properly, and the installation may require additional tools as necessary. 

The SLOW RETRACT MECHANISM (SRM) ensures the screen retracts smoothly without forceful handling, minimizing the risk of damage. Clean the screen and its housing with a soft cloth to maintain its appearance.

For product specifications, including screen dimensions and aspect ratios, please refer to the Elite Screens website.
