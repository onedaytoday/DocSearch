Sure! Here’s a technically paraphrased version of your text:

Additives should be used appropriately to enhance the appearance of clothing and household textiles, depending on whether they are whites or colors. For effective cleaning, non-biological options like Fairy should be utilized for delicate items, while bleach can be used for cleaning whites. Products such as laundry bleach should be specifically selected for colors, and stain removers like Vanish and GloWhite may be necessary for heavily soiled fabrics.

When using traditional powders or liquids, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions located on the packaging. For best results, compact powders and liquids should be measured according to the guidelines provided. Fabric conditioners can improve the feel of fabrics and should be used in conjunction with the washing machine's instructions.

Warning: Overloading the washing machine can result in inadequate cleaning, particularly with synthetic or flammable materials. 

Drying settings typically differ based on fabric type. The machine's chart outlines the recommended drying duration for various fabrics. For example, it's crucial to distribute the load evenly to avoid creases. 

In certain circumstances, such as using prewash or stain-action methods, ensure that the appropriate settings are selected. The washer features indicators to guide the user through the cycle progress, including options for Rinse Hold and Delay Start, which can be adjusted based on user preference.

After the completion of a wash cycle, indicators will signal when the machine is finished. If Rinse Hold is selected, the machine can drain without spinning. Be cautious when resetting the cycle, as it requires proper selection of options to prevent malfunctions.

Proper cleaning starts with choosing the right settings based on fabric type and desired washing conditions, which are displayed on the machine’s chart. For optimal maintenance of the washing machine and fabrics, refer to cleaning instructions for both the machine and the hoses, ensuring they remain unobstructed and functioning correctly.

In case of issues, the machine may display error codes (E10, E20, E40). Follow the troubleshooting instructions provided in the manual for resolving these errors, which may include checking water supply or ensuring hoses are correctly fitted and free from obstructions.
