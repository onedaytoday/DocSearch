### Washer Instructions

**Warning:** This information is crucial for ensuring the safety of individuals and property. It includes important guidelines to prevent risks such as fire or other hazards. Follow these instructions diligently, especially regarding unpacking items and using the washer. 

**Caution:** Keep children away from the washer, as they can become trapped in airtight spaces, leading to suffocation. 

**Service and Installation:** It is essential to follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for connecting the washer according to the national standards such as ANSI/NFPA or C22.1. Avoid placing the washer atop another appliance. 

**Gas Safety:** If you smell gas, do not attempt to light any switches. Evacuate the premises immediately and contact your neighbors for assistance. 

**Installation Requirements:** Ensure the washer is level and grounded correctly to avoid electrical hazards. The power supply should have a proper ground connection, and the washer must be connected to both hot and cold water supplies.

**Installation Clearances:** Maintain adequate distance around the washer to facilitate proper ventilation and operation. Follow minimum clearance specifications for side, rear, top, and front areas to ensure effective functioning.

**Unpacking the Washer:** Carefully remove all shipping materials, including clamps, spacers, and bolts, and ensure that all components are intact and free to move as required.

**Connecting Hoses:** Rubber washers must be installed in each hose connection. The hot water hose is marked with a red band, while the cold water hose has a blue band. Ensure each connection is tight to prevent leaks.

**Operational Checks:** Use the LCD interface to verify that the washer is functioning correctly. Follow prompts for diagnostics such as water supply issues or service needs.

**Servicing:** If any servicing is required, make sure the power is disconnected to avoid electrical shock hazards. Carefully follow disassembly instructions for any repairs.
