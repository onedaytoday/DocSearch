## Washer Instructions

**Safety Precautions**  
WARNING: This information is crucial for preventing damage to property or personal injury. Heed all WARNING and CAUTION statements, which vary by type. Be aware of the risk of fire, and follow all instructions regarding unpacking the washer. Ensure that children do not play with or become trapped in unpacked boxes or areas, which may lead to suffocation.

Follow the user manual strictly during the installation and operation of the washer. Service and installation must comply with the National ANSI/NFPA guidelines or C22.1. Avoid placing the washer on top of another unit unless specified.

**Gas Safety**  
If you detect gas, do not attempt to light any switches. Evacuate the building immediately and inform neighbors; then follow the prescribed instructions.

**Installation Considerations**  
Thank you for selecting our washer. Refer to these instructions during installation, focusing on removing spacers and protection materials packaged with the washer. Ensure the hot and cold water supply hoses are correctly connected: the hot to hot and cold to cold, and ensure water supplies are turned on.

**Electrical Requirements**  
Ensure that the power supply is safely connected to a properly grounded outlet. This prevents electrical shock hazards, which arise if the washer is not adequately grounded. Follow local and national electrical codes.

**Clearances for Installation**  
When locating your washer, avoid areas exposed to extreme temperatures or moisture. Maintain required clearances from surrounding surfaces (minimum distances should be followed to ensure effectiveness).

**Unpacking**  
To unpack the washer, remove shipping materials such as clamps and spacers. Use the provided universal wrench for assembly. Ensure the washer is level by adjusting the legs as needed.

**Hose Connections**  
Connect the supply hoses correctly, ensuring that rubber washers are present. The hot hose is identified by a red band and the cold hose by a blue band. Tighten each connection securely.

**Washer Setup**  
Follow specific instructions for properly setting up the washer to prevent noise and ensure smooth operation. Check for leaks in hose connections before use.

**Troubleshooting**  
If the washer fails to operate, check for issues such as incorrect hose connections or power supply. Refer to the LCD interface for diagnostic information. Ensure the washer is ready and has passed self-check indicators.

**Maintenance and Servicing**  
To protect the washer during maintenance, cover surfaces as necessary. Always disconnect power before servicing to avoid the risk of electrical shock. Follow proper procedures for removing and reattaching components as outlined.
