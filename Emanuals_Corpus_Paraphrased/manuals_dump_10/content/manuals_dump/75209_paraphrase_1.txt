### Instructions for Cooking Settings

**Key Settings**:  
- **UPPER ROAST**  
- **LOCKED**  
- **WARM**  
- **BAKE**  
- **DELAY**  
- **CONV (Convection)**  
- **BROIL**  
- **UPPER TIMER**  
- **REMOVE LOWER DOOR**  
- **CLEAN RACKS**  
- **TIMED**

**Preheating**:  
If preheating is required, refer to the specific instructions. Preheat the oven to a range of 170°F to 550°F (77°C to 288°C) as needed. Set to 350°F for optimal cooking.

**Adjusting Settings**:
- Press designated buttons such as "UPPER" and "BAKE" to adjust settings.  
- If "UPPER" and "BAKE" are flashing, the oven is ready to use. It will emit a sound when it reaches the desired temperature.

**Cooking Considerations**:  
When preparing foods like breads and cakes, ensure there is enough clearance and avoid overcrowding the oven to allow proper heat circulation. If air circulation is inadequate, cooking times may be altered.

**Convection Cooking**:  
- When using convection settings, cooking times should be reduced (typically by 25°F or 12°C) for efficient heat distribution.  
- To engage convection, use the "CONV" option, particularly for items requiring even cooking.

**Roasting**:  
For roasting, ensure the food is placed on a rack to allow heat to circulate around it and maximize cooking efficiency. Avoid covering the food during roasting for optimal results.

**Delayed Bake Options**:  
Utilize the delayed baking features for meats or poultry and set the cooking time accordingly, ensuring that food is cooked promptly to avoid spoilage.

**General Notes**:  
- The settings may also include timed functions and automatic shut-off features.
- Refer to the cooking chart for specific guidance on temperature adjustments and cooking times for various food items.

In summary, carefully adjust oven settings based on the type of food you are preparing while following the guidelines for convection, roasting, and preheating for optimal cooking outcomes.

2. **Cleaning Process**: Activate the self-cleaning mode to eliminate grease and food residues through high temperatures.
3. **Note**: Avoid using any abrasive cleaners that could damage the oven’s surfaces.

Always refer to specific instructions for your oven model for detailed operational guidelines and safety measures.

**Initiating the Self-Clean Cycle**

To begin the self-cleaning process, allow the oven to cool before activating the Self-Clean feature. This cycle typically lasts about 2 to 4 hours, depending on the level of cleaning required (light, medium, or heavy). Do not attempt to force open the oven door during this time; it will be locked for safety. The door will remain locked until the cleaning cycle is complete and the interior has cooled down. Look for the "UPPER," "DOOR," and "LOCKED" lights to ensure the cycle is in progress. 

If you notice "REMOVE RACKS" on the display, you must take out any oven racks before starting the cleaning process. After the self-clean cycle is finished, three beeps will signal its completion, and the lights indicating "UPPER," "DOOR," and "LOCKED" will turn off.

For general cleaning, make sure the oven is off and cooled down. It is important to wipe up spills and heavy soiling promptly to prevent excessive cleaning later on. Regular maintenance will minimize the need for deep cleaning sessions. When cleaning painted surfaces, decorative trim, or chrome parts, use a soft cloth and non-abrasive cleaners to avoid damage. Avoid directly applying harsh cleaners or using scouring pads as they can scratch the finish.

For stainless steel care, follow recommended cleaning practices to maintain its appearance. When removing or replacing the oven door, make sure to follow the specific instructions to prevent damage to hinges and other components.
