### Automatic Defrosting Instructions

The appliance is designed to automatically defrost when it is in operation, with frost accumulating on the covers. When the defrosting cycle is active, moisture from the thawed frost collects at the base, where it evaporates. Manual defrosting may be necessary if the frost reaches a significant thickness, which should be done at least once if frost builds up or if food is present.

**Important:**
Avoid using heating elements or mechanical tools to expedite the defrosting process, as this could harm your health or damage the appliance. It typically takes several hours to defrost, and you should ensure food is kept cool and covered with newspaper during this time. 

### Normal Operation Sounds

You may hear various sounds, such as whirring, coming from the cooling system and thermostat during normal operation. To maintain optimum performance, ensure food is not overcrowding the appliance or blocking air circulation, as this can hinder cooling efficiency.

### Safety and Maintenance

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the power supply. Avoid using harsh cleaners or those containing bleach. For cleaning, use mild products to prevent electrical shock or damage. After cleaning, let the appliance sit for several hours before reconnecting to ensure safe operation.

**Symptoms to Note:**
- Overcooling or improper heating of the appliance.
