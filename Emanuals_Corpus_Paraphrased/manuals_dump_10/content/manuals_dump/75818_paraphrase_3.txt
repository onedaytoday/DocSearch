### Food Storage and Safety Guidelines

To ensure safe food handling, it is crucial to follow specific health and safety protocols regarding temperature and storage times. Food should be maintained at temperatures between 7°C and 22°C for just a limited number of hours. Proper cooling and storage of cooked food should be performed immediately after service, ideally within a single week to avoid spoilage.

For food that needs to be cooled, it should not be left uncovered, and items should be stored in airtight containers such as polythene bags or bottles. It's recommended to allow cooked food to cool naturally before storage. Moreover, thawing should be done gradually to maintain quality and safety, especially for raw foods to ensure they are fully defrosted before cooking.

When storing meat, it is important to ensure it is thoroughly cooked and kept tightly wrapped to prevent contamination. The recommended use of protective covering, such as plastic or polythene, must be adhered to in order to maintain the quality of food. 

Compliance with specified technical guidelines, including maintaining proper voltage and frequency levels, is essential for optimal appliance performance. Regular service and maintenance should follow the manufacturer's instructions to avoid defects and potential hazards. 

In the case of disposing of old appliances, make sure to properly disable any locks or catches on the door to prevent accidental entrapment of children. When setting up new appliances, ensure adequate airflow around the unit to promote efficient cooling and reduce overheating risks.

Regular monitoring of the thermostat and operational sounds, such as hissing or clicking, can signal different states of appliance function. If any unusual behavior is observed, contacting customer service for assistance is encouraged.

Lastly, all food items should be consumed or discarded before reaching their expiration dates, and proper temperature guidelines should be upheld to avoid food safety issues. Follow these protocols to ensure the preservation of food quality and safety in your storage areas.
