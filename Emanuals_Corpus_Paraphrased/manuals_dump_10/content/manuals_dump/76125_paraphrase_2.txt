**Technical Specifications and Cleaning Instructions**

To ensure proper operation and maintenance, it's essential to regularly clean the grease filters and remove any charcoal residue. Adhere to the technical service guidelines provided in the guarantee conditions. Your cooker must be correctly installed and connected to the electricity supply to function safely and efficiently, following all UK regulations.
