**Cooling Procedures and Troubleshooting**

To ensure proper cooling of food items, allow them to cool before fitting them within the appliance. If issues arise, follow these corrective instructions. Please review the following details regarding appliance repairs.

**Symptom Diagnosis:**
If the appliance is not functioning correctly—either not heating adequately, being too cold, or if the electricity supply has been disrupted—check the thermostat. Adjust it to a warmer setting temporarily. Refer to the "Starting and Regulation" section for guidance.

**Lighting Issues:**
If the indicator light is not functioning correctly (possibly due to a defective component), ensure the unit is sealed properly. If water is leaking, consult the relevant section for troubleshooting steps. 

**Operational Compliance:**
Ensure that the appliance complies with household regulations (GSG, VBG, VDE) and directives, such as the Efficiency Directive. If you hear unusual noises like clicks or splashing, the appliance may have switched off unexpectedly.

**Cooling Mechanism:**
The cooling process involves drawing warmth from the food and dissipating it into the environment through rear-mounted components. This process maintains the appliance's efficiency by releasing heat as food is cooled. 

**Service Support:**
For service inquiries or to purchase assistance, contact Service Force via telephone or visit their website (www.serviceforce.co.uk). Utilize the "Something Not Right?" heading for guidance.

**Warranty Conditions:**
AEG products are guaranteed free of defects in materials and workmanship for a set period after purchase, as long as they are used according to the operating instructions and maintained correctly. For any issues, please contact AEG customer service for further information.

**International Guidelines:**
This warranty applies within the first country of purchase; for items moving between countries in the European Community (EC), ensure compliance with local regulations.
