**Paraphrased Text:**

To properly utilize the ECO VALVE for emergency drainage, ensure all necessary steps are followed for optimal function. If an issue arises, the indicator light will blink, signaling a malfunction. Common reasons include improper closure of the hose, clogging, or incorrect selection of options. 

Please inspect and clean the hose as needed, and check connections if the light is flashing. If the problem persists, consider redistributing the contents or examining the motor type. Consult the technical specifications for the AWF8120 model for additional details.

For security during transit, unscrew the three rear screws of the porthole and ensure proper connection to the cold water supply. Regular maintenance can prevent the accumulation of water. Consult a professional plumber if a significant amount of water collects.

The hose should not be twisted, and excess tension should be avoided to maintain functionality. Ensure your electrical supply adheres to the specified voltage and grounding requirements.

For any repairs, please contact an authorized service provider, and ensure compliance with local recycling regulations. Refer to the customer service section for any product concerns or warranty information.
