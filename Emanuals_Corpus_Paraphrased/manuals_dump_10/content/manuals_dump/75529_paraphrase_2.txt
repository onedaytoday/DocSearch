**SLOW COOKING**

Using a slow cooker is advantageous for preparing budget-friendly meals. This method is particularly effective for tougher cuts of meat and requires less active cooking time. Typically, meat achieves a browned finish after several hours of cooking.

**SLOW COOKING MEAT AND POULTRY**

When preparing meat or poultry, consider cooking the joint or stuffing separately. Ensure the meat is thawed before cooking and use a meat thermometer to verify that it reaches an internal temperature of at least 88°C. 

**SOUPS, CASSEROLES, AND STEWS**

Start by bringing the ingredients to a boil on the stovetop, then transfer to the slow cooker and cover tightly. 

**MILK PUDDINGS AND GENERAL TIPS**

Thoroughly thaw ingredients before cooking. To thicken sauces, you can utilize cornflour. Be mindful of preventing ingredients from curdling during the cooking process. For reheating, cool food first and then reheat either in the oven or microwave, but do so only once.

**CARE AND CLEANING**

Allow the device to cool completely before switching off the electricity and cleaning. Avoid harsh cleaners that contain bleach as they can damage finishes; instead, use gentle cleaning materials. 

**CLEANING APPLIANCE EXTERIORS**

Use a soft cloth for cleaning to prevent scratching the surface. Immediately wipe off any spills to protect the finish.

**CLEANING CONTROL KNOBS AND HANDLES**

Avoid abrasive cleaners that may dull the surface finish.

**REMOVING AND REPLACING WIRE RACKS**

To remove wire racks, gently unhook from the cavity and replace them securely afterward.

**CLEANING THE HOB**

Clean the hotplate surface and ensure the burners are free from debris. Use appropriate cleaning methods based on the materials to prevent damage.

**REPLACING HOTPLATE BURNER PARTS**

When installing burner crowns, ensure they fit correctly and evenly to guarantee proper ignition.

**CLEANING SHELVES, WIRE-RUNNERS, AND OVEN FURNITURE**

Shelves can typically be cleaned in the dishwasher. Regular maintenance is key for optimal performance.

**CLEANING OVEN COMPARTMENTS**

Oven and grill interiors often feature Stayclean coatings, which should be cleaned manually as recommended to maintain efficiency.

**CLEANING THE DOOR(S)**

Utilize appropriate household cleaners and avoid chemical bleaches for safe maintenance.

### Moving Your Appliance

When moving your appliance, ensure that it is securely covered. Alternatively, remove the covering as needed. Be cautious, as the appliance can be heavy. To transport it, lift from the front and secure each corner. 

#### Location of the Appliance

Install the appliance in areas such as a bed-sitting room rather than in bathrooms or shower zones. The hotplate or cooker should not be directly beneath shelves. If the hotplate is positioned incorrectly, ensure that it is adjusted to an appropriate height, keeping in mind safety requirements regarding LPG—do not position it below ground level or on a boat.

#### Leveling the Appliance

Adjust the appliance’s height by rotating the leveling feet clockwise or counterclockwise to ensure stability.

#### Connecting to the Electricity Supply

**Warning:** The appliance must be properly earthed. Connect only to an A.C. power supply that is correctly grounded. The electricity supply should be situated in a location that allows for easy access to the isolation switch for emergency purposes. Ensure the wiring is routed correctly and the outlet is functioning as described below. Replace any damaged parts if needed.

For connection, if using a molded plug, ensure it conforms to British Standard specifications. The wires should be connected as follows:
- **Green and Yellow** - Earth
- **Blue** - Neutral
- **Brown** - Live

Make sure that these wires are connected to the correct terminals.

#### Connecting to Gas Supply

Connect the gas supply using only fittings with B.S.P. threaded ends located below the hotplate. **Note:** Use only liquid sealants for the gas inlet pipe; do not use P.T.F.E. sealant tape. Ensure the supply line is adequately secured. 

**Important:** Flexible tubing must comply with BS.669 current edition standards for LPG. 

#### Fitting the Stability Chain

It is advisable to secure the appliance with a stability chain connected to the gas supply. Follow the instructions to anchor it properly in the designated corner.

#### Pressure Testing

To check pressure, turn on the supply and light each hotplate burner. 

#### Checking the Grill

Activate the grill and note that the light should turn on when released.

#### Checking the Hotplate

Inspect hotplate crowns to ensure they are seated correctly. Test each burner by turning it on and releasing it.

#### Checking the Lid Shut-Off Device

Turn on the hotplate to check that the gas supply is functioning. When the hotplate is turned off, gas should cease to flow.

#### Checking the Main Oven

Set the thermostat, and observe if the oven ignites correctly. The flame failure device (F.S.D.) should allow gas to flow while the oven is operating.
