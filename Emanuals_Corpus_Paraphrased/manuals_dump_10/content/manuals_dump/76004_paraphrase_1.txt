The compactor is available for both free-standing and built-in installations. It can be converted from a built-in to a free-standing model by using the Toe Accessory ETC15TKH, which is sold separately. For a free-standing setup, it is essential to ensure the proper positioning of the toe accessory at the back for optimal functionality. When installing, the compactor must be mounted securely to the countertop, as indicated in the accompanying diagrams. Note that if countertops are involved, they need to be firmly attached to the cabinetry. Ensure that the electrical outlet is correctly positioned, as specified in the Grounding Instructions, and avoid pinching the power cord beneath the unit or in any service areas. 

For the installation, adjust the four screws located at the front to enable the rollers to glide along the countertop. Fasten the screws just enough to allow movement while ensuring the back is also securely attached. Utilize a wood block at the front for additional support and ensure the leveling legs are properly set.
