Upon completing the laundry process, adjust the brightness settings accordingly. Adhere to the sorting guidelines for each load: separate whites, colors, and synthetics, with whites and colors washed together. New colored items should be laundered first. Treat stubborn stains promptly, perhaps by soaking overnight, and utilize specialized cleaning products as needed.

Follow specific instructions for fabric types, such as using cold water for cottons and linens, and incorporate prewash phases for heavily soiled items. For mixed loads of whites and colors, use temperatures between 40°C and 60°C. Jeans should also be washed in cold water, and ensure that synthetic garments are treated according to their label instructions.

Utilize rinse options judiciously when dealing with stains or sensitive fabrics. The machine's settings, including "EASY IRON" and "DELICATES," optimize the wash while minimizing creasing. For manual items, ensure proper redistribution after washing to maintain effectiveness in cleaning.

Regular maintenance involves cleaning the machine components, such as emptying hoses and checking seals. Should any indicator lights activate, follow the troubleshooting guidelines to address potential issues.

Inspect hoses and connections periodically to prevent leaks or inefficiencies in water flow. Engage safety features, such as the CHILD SAFETY LOCK, as required.

For optimal performance, divide loads according to fabric type and soil level, and adjust wash cycles accordingly. Consult the manual for detailed instructions on installation and setup.

Technical specifications related to water supply and energy ratings should be reviewed for compliance and efficiency. Ensure proper unpacking and connection of components as per the guidelines provided.

This revision maintains the technical essence of the original text while improving clarity and structure.

Positioning and the surrounding conditions affect the application of the coating. For cookers or coal-burning appliances, make sure they are covered when facing the cooker in environments where temperatures drop below 0°C. Ensure the hose is properly connected to the water supply to prevent breakdowns. If the hose is too short, it may be necessary to purchase a specialized hose. Consult the guidelines in the "Technical Water-stop" chapter for proper hose operation.

The hose needs to be securely fastened to prevent damage, and it should be elevated above ground level when connected to the branch. Ensure that the hose is adequately ventilated and complies with service ratings. 

**Warnings:**
- Handle the equipment according to safety guidelines.
- Replace any damaged hoses immediately.
- Recycle discarded hoses correctly, in line with household waste regulations. 

For more recycling information, refer to the service center or the place of purchase. Follow all operating instructions to keep appliances functioning optimally. Normal loading procedures should be followed without pre-washing, and all loaded items should be secured and cleaned as necessary.
