**New_12108_14108.qxp PM Guidelines for Laundry Care** 

When washing clothes and household items, it is essential to distinguish between the various types of textiles: whites, colors, and delicate items. Products like Fairy's non-biological detergent are suitable for both whites and colored garments, while specialized laundry bleaches should be used cautiously with delicate items. It is important to choose appropriate cleaning agents based on colorfastness and the type of fabric, whether using traditional powders or liquids. 

For compact powders and liquids, carefully follow the specific instructions provided on the packaging, including the top and back of the container. Fabric softeners can enhance the feel of synthetic fabrics, and again, adherence to the guidelines is crucial to avoid damage to garments. 

**Washing Symbols and Settings** 

Ensure to familiarize yourself with washing symbols that indicate appropriate settings for bleaching, ironing, dry cleaning, and tumble drying. The normal wash action can effectively clean fabrics under recommended temperatures, but care should be taken not to expose items improperly to high temperatures. 

For colored and synthetic garments, it’s advisable to use cool washes (40°C or below), while cotton items can typically withstand higher temperatures (up to 60°C). 

**Care for Specific Items** 

Options for washing include handwashing and machine washing various items such as tablecloths and shirts. It is vital to handle heavily soiled or delicate items with care to prevent damage.
