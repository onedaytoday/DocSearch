**Paraphrased Text:**

Within a few months of purchase, issues related to craftsmanship or options may be addressed free of charge. The appliance must be used as specified regarding the stated electrical rating and conditions. Food should only be cooked from uncooked and fully thawed items. Cooked food should not be put back into the freezer, while thawed food should be consumed or reheated. 

Once food has completely thawed—typically over several hours—ensure that the yellow light (B) is off. If you wish to accelerate the freezing of fresh food, activate the fast-freeze function about two hours prior to placing the food inside. For repairs or servicing, please contact Service Force, as this remains your responsibility. 

Make sure to follow the proper food preparation instructions to avoid issues like freezer burn. Meat should be cooked thoroughly, and when distributing food, ensure even circulation to foster proper cooling. Improper handling or storage can lead to food spoilage and loss of quality. 

Regarding food thawing, if any frozen items are affected by freezer burn, it’s advisable to remove and dispose of them promptly.
