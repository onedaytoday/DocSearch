### Installation of MAN-TUBIG

**Connecting to M1, M2, M3, and PE:**
To establish the connection, the phase must be linked to other phases. It is recommended to use shielded twisted pairs to enhance immunity. The shield should be grounded properly, tying the shield of the connection to the protective earth.

**Connecting AC Power:**
The supply should be connected to the AC1, AC2, and AC3 terminals, ensuring the Protective Earth (PE) is established correctly. It is mandatory to use shielded wires for the AC supply to enhance immunity. The fourth wire should connect to the protective earth.

**DC Connections:**
When connecting DC, ensure that heat is managed appropriately. If the system is powered off, ensure proper procedures are followed for safe connection and energy distribution to maintain operation.

**Connecting 24VDC:**
For the 24VDC supply, use shielded AWG wires. It is critical that the shield is grounded and reinforced for insulation to avoid interference. The positive and negative polarities must be observed during the connections.

**Feedback Mechanism:**
The feedback system is designed for easy integration and requires using shielded twisted pairs. Grounding the shield is essential. Follow the provided assembly instructions closely to ensure proper setup. 

**Feedback Types:**
Feedback Section A involves multiple feedback types, including Interpolated and Tachometer options. Care should be taken to ensure compatibility with the system during integration, and connections must be made according to specified guidelines.
