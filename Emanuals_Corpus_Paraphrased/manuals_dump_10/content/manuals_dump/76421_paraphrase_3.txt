To select or modify lighting options, choose the corresponding setting. The selected light will illuminate for a few seconds, indicating the countdown of the chosen mode. If the option is activated, the light will blink to signify the active phase. Once the countdown ends, the system will automatically adjust the settings accordingly.

If the Night mode is engaged, the selected light will remain on, while indicators will support the process. To deactivate the light features, use the ON/OFF switch.

The device is designed to handle different fabric types, including synthetics and delicate items. To prevent any potential drying issues, ensure proper connection of the hose to the outlet. When drying items, be aware of the specific options for synthetics or non-stop drying modes. Excessive heating may damage certain fabrics, particularly synthetic ones.

It's important to sort laundry based on fabric types to prevent damage or discoloration. Whites should be washed separately from colored items, and specific detergents should be utilized based on the fabric type. For instance, bleach should be handled carefully and kept away from inappropriate items to avoid damage.

For cleaning purposes, use fabric conditioners as directed. These help reduce static cling and improve fabric feel. Pay close attention to washing symbols and instructions to ensure optimal cleaning results. 

Cleaning and maintenance of the washing machine itself are crucial. Regularly check and clear the catchment area and hoses to maintain functionality. If malfunctions occur, refer to troubleshooting guides, addressing issues like hose blockages or imbalances. 

If error codes appear, such as E10, E20, or E40, follow the provided instructions for rectification. Ensure that all settings are correctly adjusted, and that the appliance is properly installed to avoid complications.
