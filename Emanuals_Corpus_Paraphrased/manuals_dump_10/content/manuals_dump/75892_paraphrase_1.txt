### KO-SANTO KO-SANTO Combinations Instructions

**Operating Instructions Overview**  
These operating instructions provide essential information for the appliance's correct use and maintenance. Owners should refer to them for guidance on technical specifications, functioning notes, and safety warnings. Important operational details, including supplementary information, can be found under "Technical Terminology." The document also offers troubleshooting advice in the section titled "Something Wrong?" For further assistance, please contact Service Force.

**Appliance Location and Setup**  
Ensure that the appliance is placed in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight and heat sources. Specific installation requirements include maintaining adequate clearance around the appliance as indicated in the specifications. Adjustments may be required based on the appliance's energy performance ratings (e.g., SN to C).

**Electrical Safety**  
WARNING: The appliance must be properly earthed. Follow the guidelines provided for connecting to the electricity supply, ensuring that the power rating matches the requirements. Use appropriately rated wiring as outlined in the instructions.

**Child Safety**  
To prevent accidents, keep children away from the appliance. Ensure that safety features, such as catches and locks, are fully utilized to prevent accidental openings.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Regular cleaning is essential for optimal performance. Always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply before cleaning. Consult the specific cleaning procedures outlined in the instructions to avoid the risk of malfunctions.

**Operational Features**  
The appliance includes specific functions like FAST CHILL and FAST FREEZE, which can be manually activated. Indicators are available to show operational status, including warnings if temperatures exceed safe levels. Any indication of a malfunction should prompt immediate action, as detailed in the troubleshooting section.

**Initial Setup and Usage**  
Upon installation, allow sufficient time for the appliance to reach optimal temperature before loading food items. Monitor compartment temperatures to ensure they align with food safety standards.

For any complications or further technical support, please refer to the authorized service provider.

To manually activate the FAST CHILL/-FREEZE mode, press the appropriate button. The FAST FREEZE function becomes active once the recessed switch is engaged. To deactivate the appliance (child-proof feature), press the ON/OFF button for approximately three seconds, which initiates a countdown. This countdown exits after a designated time has passed.

If the appliance is in standby mode, it will typically maintain a temperature of +15°C. Unintentional closing of doors can compromise the internal temperature and foster mold growth. To disengage standby mode, rotate the recessed switch counterclockwise until it indicates an increase to +10°C. The appliance resets to +15°C when in standby mode. 

Warnings and alerts inform users of rising temperatures or thawing foods. If the internal temperature exceeds the set maximum by more than 5°C, a visual and audible warning activates. This warning will cease when temperatures return to within acceptable ranges.

If thawing occurs while the temperature rises above -4°C, a thaw warning lights up. Technical malfunctions will also trigger alarms (F1 to F7), indicating issues that need a service technician's attention.

To optimize food storage, use the provided shelves and trays, adjusting their height as necessary. Ensure that bottles are stored correctly to avoid obstruction. Regularly monitor the thermometers, particularly in the lowest shelf area, which is typically the warmest, and maintain safe food temperatures, ideally below -18°C.

For efficiency, foods should be properly wrapped to facilitate quick chilling or freezing. Consult the food safety guidelines for defrosting and handling techniques, ensuring that the rigid instructions are followed to maintain health standards.

When cleaning, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply, adhere to operational guidelines, and use appropriate cleaning agents. Replace any faulty components or lighting as needed.

In the event of warnings or alerts, refer to service options provided and maintain communication with support for further assistance. For detailed troubleshooting, users are encouraged to contact AEG Service Force with the appliance’s purchase information readily available.

**Technical Information**

The product operates via a cooling system, which maintains the temperature by dissipating heat away from the food storage area. The cooling mechanism relies on a closed-loop system that circulates refrigerant, transferring heat to the environment. The cooling unit is typically installed in the rear or built into the appliance. Heat is expelled into the surrounding air, while the appliance complies with relevant household appliance regulations.

The product adheres to European legislation standards, including the Low Voltage Directive (73/23/EWG) and the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (89/336/EWG, including 92/31/EWG).
