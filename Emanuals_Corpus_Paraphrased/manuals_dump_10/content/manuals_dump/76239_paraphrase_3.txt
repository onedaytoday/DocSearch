To conclude a cycle when the "END" light is on and the "RINSE HOLD" option is selected, first toggle the "DOOR" and "END" lights off. Next, switch to "DRAIN," then press "START/PAUSE" or, alternately, turn off, select "SPIN," and then press "START/PAUSE." Once the process is complete, the "END" light will illuminate while the "DOOR" light turns off. Turn the machine off afterward, allowing for any residual water to drain out slightly. If the system runs continuously or exhibits other electrical issues, refer to the manual.

For washing programs, options are available for various fabric types including "COTTONS/LINEN" and "COLOUREDS"; these can also be adjusted to "EASY-CARES" or "HANDWASH." The appliance operates efficiently around the specified load sizes mentioned in the EN and IEC chapters, ensuring a minimum of C to effectively treat stains. There are modes like "ECO" for energy savings, and settings for "PRE-WASH" or "STAIN" options available for quick cycles.

Cleaning guidance includes using a clean, damp cloth on the machine's exterior while avoiding scouring pads or abrasive materials. To maintain structural integrity, it is essential to follow the necessary procedures carefully, ensuring all components are cleaned without damage.

For troubleshooting, if problems arise, customers are advised to reach out to Customer Service. The warranty may cover operational issues, and technicians can assist free of charge. If lights flash, check for any blown fuses or ensure the system is properly closed. Verify the proper connection of hoses, avoid clogs, and examine any collection tanks for blockages.

During operation, excessive foaming or incorrect water levels may indicate issues with the hose or its connections. Ensure the emptying hose is firmly secured, and consult the manual for the correct installation procedure. Adjustments might be necessary if the appliance is overloaded or if settings are incorrect. 

If any malfunction occurs, precautionary measures include turning off the machine and reviewing connection protocols, especially in conditions that might involve frost or overheating.

Finally, for effective transport of the machine, take care to manage pressure and cover connections to prevent leaks or damage during transit.
