### Drying Instructions

**Caution:** Use the drying function only as specified. Select the appropriate fabric type—Cottons, Synthetics, or Wool—before starting the drying process. Ensure that the dryer hose is properly connected. If you observe any warnings regarding the drying phase, refer to the corresponding guidelines.

When drying mixed fabrics, turn the dryer on using the correct settings. To avoid creasing, consider using the pressing feature. The machine has indicators that inform you when it's in different phases, including a 'locked' phase. Refer to the user manual for specific flashing lights indicating the current status.

**Helpful Tips for Sorting:**
- Separate items as follows: whites, colors, synthetics, and heavier fabrics (like towels and tablecloths).
- Always wash new items separately from established whites to prevent discoloration.
- Avoid overloading the machine, particularly with synthetic materials, which can cause increased drying times.

**Stain Removal Guidance:**
For stubborn stains, pre-treat with an appropriate solution (like overnight soaking with a stain remover) and follow with a regular cycle. Use bleach only on whites and fast-colored fabrics when indicated.

**Washing Program Suggestions:**
Utilize different washing programs based on fabric type—such as cold washes for synthetics or reducing spins for delicate items.

**Drying Recommendations:**
Adjust the drying settings based on the fabric type. Consider using the 'Extra Dry' feature for heavy items and ensure you don't select 'Prewash' unless necessary, as this can run longer cycles.

**Maintenance and Cleaning:**
Regularly clean the lint filter and internal components as outlined in the user manual. Disconnect from the power supply before performing maintenance.

If problems arise, follow the emergency emptying procedure carefully to avoid any damage. Always ensure that parts are securely fastened after any cleaning process.
