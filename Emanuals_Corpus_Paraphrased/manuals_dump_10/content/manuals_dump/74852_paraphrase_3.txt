### Cooking Instructions and Safety Guidelines

The heat source for cooking is located at the back and is designed to provide intense, searing temperatures. Once the cooking surface has reached the appropriate temperature, you can place the food on it. Ensure that the cooking element is positioned correctly, facing the rear, for optimal operation.

**Safety Warning**: This device is equipped with a three-prong grounding plug to protect against electrical shock. It must be connected to a properly grounded outlet. 

To cook meat effectively, face it towards the heating element and allow it to cook through. Once the meat is finished, it can be combined with other foods as desired. 

**Instructions for Operation**:
1. Turn the switch to the "On" position.  
2. Adjust the dial counterclockwise to the "High" setting and wait a few seconds until you hear a sound indicating the element is heating up. If the light dims after a few seconds, turn the dial to "Off" and troubleshoot. Should the unit fail to heat, try holding the match near the heating element while adjusting the setting to "High."

**Cleaning Guidelines**: 
- The cooking grates should be cleaned regularly to prevent the buildup of grease and food residues. Clean them immediately after cooking and before turning off the unit. Use a cloth to wipe down the surfaces.  
- For deep cleaning, allow the unit to cool first, and then use a suitable cleaner.

**Troubleshooting**:
Inspect the unit thoroughly at least once a month for any signs of malfunction, such as uneven heating or failure to ignite. If any issue arises, check the power supply and replace the battery if necessary. 

**Warranty Information**: 
This product comes with a limited lifetime warranty that covers manufacturing defects. However, it does not cover damages due to misuse, alterations, scratches, or exposure to harsh cleaning chemicals. For warranty claims or additional support, please contact Customer Service.
