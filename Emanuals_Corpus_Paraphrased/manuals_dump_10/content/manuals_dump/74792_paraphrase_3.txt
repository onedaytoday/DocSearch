For further assistance or to report issues, please refer to provided contact details or the AEG website.

Press and hold (C) to display the current temperature, which should show as +8°C for both the H and the other display. To access the functions properly, ensure that C is slightly adjusted. If there's a malfunction, check that the appliance is set to the lowest setting, and ensure that food and other items are not obstructing the shelves. The height of the shelves may need adjustment, but be sure to refer back to the guidelines. 

If the display shows (F), press (C) for a few seconds. A countdown will occur before the system turns off. If the appliance needs servicing, contact AEG Service Force for mechanical issues or breakdowns. Refer to the "Cleaning" section for maintenance details, ensuring you avoid any electrical shocks or hazards during cleaning.

To prevent overheating, ensure food items are stored correctly and avoid overly covering them. The performance can diminish due to improper placement or excessive humidity. Additionally, food should be stored in airtight containers, and items like onions and garlic should be kept separate to prevent odor transfer. Regularly clean the interior to prevent frost buildup, and maintain it with fresh cleaning solutions as needed.

The FROSTMATIC function, which maintains optimal freezing conditions, can be activated to preserve fresh food. This function has an indicator light that signals when it's engaged. Monitor and maintain frost thickness carefully, as it can obstruct airflow and efficiency. Follow the correct procedures for defrosting, which involves switching off the appliance and safely removing items to prevent exposure to warm temperatures. Always refer to the cleaning guidelines for safe practices during maintenance.

When preparing ice cubes, respect the appliance's capacity rating and ensure liquids are cooled adequately before placement. Avoid storing high-water content foods in tight containers as they may burst under freezing conditions. Each food type has specific requirements for optimal freezing, and it's essential to adhere to recommendations for maintaining quality and freshness over time.

### FROSTMATIC Functionality Overview

The FROSTMATIC function is indicated by a yellow light, which serves a critical role in preserving the freshness of food. This light remains illuminated during the operation of the FROSTMATIC feature. Should manual operation be necessary, you can deactivate this function accordingly.

Occasionally, frost may accumulate in the appliance, which can affect efficiency. Regular monitoring is recommended; if frost becomes excessively thick, it’s advisable to adjust the thermostat or resort to the recommended thawing procedures. Once defrosting is completed, ensure that you remove any excess frost and food packaging, such as newspapers.

Be cautious during the defrosting process, as the indicator light (N) will flash to signal the function's active state. To turn off the appliance, maintain pressure on the designated button for several seconds until a countdown appears.

Cleaning is fundamental for optimal operation, and it is suggested to clean the appliance regularly with a soft cloth and approved cleaning products. Making sure surfaces are sanitary enhances the appliance’s longevity and efficiency.

Should malfunctions occur, refer to the manual for troubleshooting tips, including how to reset the system or adjust temperature settings. For persistent issues, professional service from AEG should be consulted.

To maintain optimal cooling performance, ensure the appliance is appropriately stocked without overcrowding, as this can hinder airflow. The COOLMATIC function specifically allows for enhanced cooling at +15°C, beneficial for certain food items, while minimizing frost formation.
