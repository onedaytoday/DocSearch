To initiate the washing process, press the START/PAUSE button (labeled START/PAUZE or MARCHE/PAUSE). The display will indicate the current cycle status. If a particular cycle is complete, the corresponding time will be shown. Adjust the duration as necessary based on the type and fabric of the clothing. 

For additional functions, press the START/PAUSE button again. If you wish to stop the cycle, turn the machine off by selecting OFF (UIT or ARRET). If further actions are needed, such as PUMP OUT, SPIN, or GENTLE SPIN, select the appropriate option and then press START/PAUSE again. 

If RINSE HOLD is selected, the START/PAUSE button will flash once the cycle is finished. To resume, press START/PAUSE. To halt the process, turn the machine off, then select PUMP OUT, and press START/PAUSE again.

Once the cycle is completed, the END indicator (EINDE or FIN) will illuminate. In case RINSE HOLD was selected, the START/PAUSE button will continue to flash. To proceed, press START/PAUSE again.

When encountering errors such as E10, E20, or E40, refer to the troubleshooting table. If the issue persists, contact Customer Service. Ensure that doors are properly closed and that there are no obstructions. 

For cleaning, avoid using abrasive materials that could damage surfaces. Regular maintenance is essential for optimal operation. The machine should be cleaned periodically, especially the sections susceptible to residue accumulation.

Warnings include ensuring the device is turned off before performing any maintenance or cleaning tasks to avoid hazards. Issues such as excessive foaming or clogged hoses may require adjustments or professional service.

When adjusting settings for washing cycles, appropriate fabric types must be selected, and pre-treatment may be necessary for stains. If stains persist or cycles are unsatisfactory, re-evaluate the chosen functions and options.

For emergency drain processes, follow the outlined instructions carefully to prevent potential injuries or equipment damage. Make sure to allow sufficient time for cooling before handling any heated components.
