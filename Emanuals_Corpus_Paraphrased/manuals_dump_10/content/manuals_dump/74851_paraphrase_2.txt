### Lighting Instructions for Grill Burners

Before lighting the grill burners, ensure all controls are set to the "OFF" position. To ignite using electronic igniters, turn the control knob to the "HIGH" setting. You should hear a clicking sound immediately. If ignition does not occur within a few seconds, turn the knob to "OFF" and attempt to light using a match.

#### Match Lighting Procedure

If electronic ignition fails, use a match to light the burners. Place the match near the burner while turning the control knob counterclockwise to "HIGH". Once the burner lights, keep the match at a safe distance to avoid burns.

**Note:** If there are persistent lighting issues, refer to the troubleshooting section and ensure that the grill is adequately preheated, and allow it to cool down when not in use. Always ensure that supply cords and hoses are clear from heat sources to prevent hazards.

### Cooking Guidelines

When cooking, it’s essential to position food correctly to utilize the grill’s heating elements effectively. For optimal searing results, place meat on the hottest parts of the grill. Ensure all food is fully cooked by verifying internal temperatures.

### Attaching the Rotisserie

To use the rotisserie, secure the meat onto the spit, ensuring it is balanced. Turn the switch to "On" to enable the motor, allowing even cooking. 

**Electrical Safety Note:** Ensure your grill is connected to a properly grounded three-prong outlet, complying with electrical safety standards.

### Light the Side Burners

Follow similar procedures as above for lighting side burners. Ensure to turn to "HIGH" immediately after igniting.

### Drip Tray Maintenance

Regularly check and clean the drip tray to prevent grease buildup. Allow the grill to cool before cleaning, and always ensure it is covered when not in use.

### Cooking Grates Care

Clean cooking grates promptly after use. Use a cloth or brush suitable for grill cleaning. If grates are stainless steel, use an appropriate cleaner to maintain a polished appearance.
