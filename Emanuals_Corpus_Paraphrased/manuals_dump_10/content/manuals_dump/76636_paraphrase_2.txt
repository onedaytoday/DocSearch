### Performance Features

**Quality:** The BDP-05FD delivers up to 1920x1080p resolution for exceptional picture clarity. With True 24FPS, you can experience your movies as the director envisioned. The BDP-05FD outputs both HD audio and video signals to your HDMI-capable A/V receiver or HD flat panel. Unlike conventional connections, the HDMI interface simplifies connections by replacing multiple cables while maintaining signal integrity. HDMI 1.3a also supports 12-bit color depth, enhancing subtle color gradations.

**Control:** The BDP-05FD features HDMI Control, enabling you to manage all your HDMI Control-equipped Pioneer A/V devices with a single interface. Each DAC utilizes Wolfson technology with a signal-to-noise ratio of 117 dB, ensuring high-quality audio performance for music and film soundtracks.

**Reduction Technology:** The internal circuitry, developed by Pioneer, digitally reshapes the audio clock waveform to minimize jitter across all content. The PQLS feature provides jitter-free audio transmission from CD content when paired with the SC-05 or SC-07 Elite Receivers. 

**Touch Controls:** The BDP-05FD includes sleek, integrated touch-sensitive controls exclusive to Elite Blu-ray Disc Players. By adjusting the low-pass filter, waveform distortion in the coaxial digital output is significantly minimized.

**Video Processing:** The BDP-05FD employs advanced video reduction techniques to minimize Gaussian noise on a pixel-by-pixel basis without compromising image quality. Additionally, it enhances independently created high-definition video streams, allowing you to watch Blu-ray movies alongside bonus features using Picture-in-Picture functionality.

**Audio Compatibility:** For compatibility with non-HDMI receivers and preamps, the BDP-05FD decodes all advanced audio formats internally, including Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD High Resolution, and DTS-HD Master Audio. Bitstream audio output of these formats is also available via HDMI.
