**Autodrying of Synthetic Fabrics**
To initiate autodrying for synthetics, utilize the designated buttons to select the desired options. When setting the variables, ensure that they are not too high to minimize the risk of damage. It is essential to turn off the machine after drying to avoid any hazards. 

**Sorting and Washing Instructions**
When preparing laundry, sort items according to their types: separate whites, colors, synthetics, and specific fabric categories such as towels, tablecloths, and sheets. Always wash new colored fabrics separately to maintain their vibrancy. Whites should be washed first, along with pillowcases and items that are prone to discoloration. When drying is complete, carefully inspect items for any residual detergents or stains, particularly on synthetic pieces, as these can lead to fire hazards if not addressed.

**Drying Parameters and Recommendations**
In regard to drying, refer to the recommended settings outlined in applicable charts. Avoid overloading the dryer, as it compromises efficiency, particularly with synthetics. For stubborn stains, pre-treat fabrics before washing using recommended methods (e.g., bleach for whites and colors as applicable), and ensure adherence to fabric care guidelines throughout the process.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**
Regular cleaning of the washer-dryer is vital for optimal performance. Disconnect the system from electricity before performing maintenance. Clean lint traps and hoses to prevent obstruction, which can lead to malfunction. In cases where blockage occurs, follow the outlined steps to clear any clogs and ensure efficient operation. 

**Error Codes and Troubleshooting**
Should a malfunction arise, error codes E10, E20, and E40 signal specific issues that may require immediate attention. It is advisable to consult the user manual for detailed solutions pertaining to these errors. Always handle the appliance with care during maintenance when addressing these error codes.

**Technical Specifications**
Refer to the rating plate and accompanying charts for specific water supply requirements and operational parameters. Use the guidelines to ensure proper setup during installation, safeguarding that hoses are adequately positioned and not kinked.

**Revised Text:**

To properly install the washer-dryer, ensure that the unit is positioned correctly without obstruction around it, as this can impede its operation. The water supply hose must be securely attached, following the manufacturer's threading guidelines. If necessary, use a longer hose that complies with local authority and building regulations.

For installations that require permanent plumbing, follow the supplied instructions to connect the hose appropriately, ensuring that it is adequately secured at both ends. If the existing hose is too short, seek a replacement that meets the required specifications.

Caution: Do not position the washer-dryer on carpeting, as this can cause overheating and damage. Ensure that the appliance is connected to a proper drainage system and that it is earthed to prevent electric shock. All electrical connections should follow indicated ratings, and the wiring should be aligned according to color codes (earth, neutral, and live).

Before use, confirm that the hoses are correctly positioned to avoid kinks or blockages. Ensure all screws and mounts are securely fastened to avoid instability.

For recycling and disposal, consult local guidelines and the service center for proper methods to prevent environmental hazards. Products typically require minimal prewash measures and should be loaded adhering to capacity guidelines.

Regarding warranty claims, make sure to retain proof of purchase and follow the manufacturer's service instructions to claim any repairs under warranty. Should you need assistance or further information about your appliance, contact the customer service department at the provided links or numbers.

For any servicing or replacement parts, always consult an authorized service provider to maintain product integrity and safety.
