### Safety Information

**Grounding and Electrical Safety**  
Ensure that your appliance is properly grounded. The washer requires a dedicated circuit with a properly installed electrical outlet, following the National ANSI/NFPA standards. Failure to ground the washer correctly may lead to shock hazards or equipment malfunction. If you suspect grounding issues, consult a licensed electrician.

**Gas Safety**  
In the event of a gas smell, do not operate any electrical switches, evacuate the area immediately, and follow appropriate emergency procedures.

### Clearance and Installation Guidelines

**Installation Location**  
Do not install the washer in areas prone to extreme temperatures or weather exposure. Maintain necessary clearances as outlined in the installation instructions. When placing the washer in a closet or recess, ensure there’s adequate space at the top and sides for ventilation.

**Connecting Water Supply**  
The water supply hoses are color-coded: the hot water hose is marked with red, and the cold water hose is marked with blue. Confirm that rubber washers are present at the ends of the hoses before connecting to the corresponding water supplies. Hand-tighten to avoid leaks.
