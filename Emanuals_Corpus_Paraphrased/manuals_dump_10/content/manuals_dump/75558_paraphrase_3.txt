## Introduction

This document serves as a guide to the British Council Directive 90/396/EEC for the operation and safety of the cooker. It is essential to read this manual thoroughly to ensure the cooker is used correctly and efficiently. This appliance is designed for preparing food and must only be operated by those familiar with its functionality.

### Lighting the Cooker

To ignite the hotplate, ensure the battery is correctly installed. Turn the appropriate control to the highest setting and then release it immediately. **Warning:** In the event of a fire, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; instead, smother the flames with a suitable cover or cloth. 

### Cooking Instructions

When operating the cooker, adjust the heat settings as required. Remember to check food regularly for thorough cooking, adjusting the temperature from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then 'LOW' as necessary. High settings are suitable for quick cooking tasks such as toasting, while lower settings are better for thicker items.

### Preheating

Preheating is typically necessary when working with specific dishes such as toast or teacakes. Position food appropriately based on thickness and type to ensure even cooking; heavier items may require different settings.

### Hotplate Settings

Adjustments to the hotplate should be made as follows: from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then to 'LOW', depending on the food being prepared, such as chips or stews. Ensure that pots and pans sit flat to optimize heat distribution and avoid warping.

### Cooking Chart

For optimal results, follow the cooking chart provided for various foods including meats and pastries. Always ensure food is thoroughly thawed, especially when it includes stuffing.

### Soups and Stews

For soups and stews, begin by heating ingredients thoroughly before reducing to a simmer. Consider thickening with cornflour if desired.

### Reheating Food

Always cool food properly before reheating, and only do so once. Microwave re-heating is also an option.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining safety and hygiene. Use recommended cleaning materials for various surfaces, including the hotplate and cooker body. Ensure to wipe any splashes immediately to prevent any fire hazards.

### Servicing and Compliance

Regular service should be conducted as per the manufacturerâ€™s guidelines to ensure compliance with current health and safety regulations. 

This guidance diagrammatically illustrates the layout and functional attributes of the cooker and identifies suitable areas for installation.

### Positioning the Cooker

Ensure proper placement of the cooker, considering ventilation and distance from combustible materials. Follow specific measurements for space requirements, including width and depth, for optimal performance.
