## OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS

### DESCRIPTION/CONSTRUCTION

Electric Tilting Frying Pans are designed for versatile cooking applications, including browning and roasting. These units are equipped with advanced motorized lifting systems for easy operation, and they are suitable for different cooking methods such as steaming and frying. 

### INITIAL OPERATION

Before first use, clean the pan thoroughly and preheat it to 320°F (160°C). Follow manufacturer recommendations for initial seasoning to enhance cooking performance. 

### STANDBY AND AUTOMATIC CONTROL

To conserve energy and maintain efficiency, the frying pan should be in standby mode when not in use. The temperature ranges from 68°F to 446°F (230°C) with automatic controls to ensure precise cooking. 

### WORKING RULES

1. **Safety Precautions**: 
   - Do not operate the unit with an empty pan to prevent overheating.
   - In case of fire, smother flames with a cover or cloth.
  
2. **Cleaning and Maintenance**: 
   - Allow the frying pan to cool before cleaning.
   - Regular service checks should be performed annually by qualified personnel.

### OWNER'S OBLIGATIONS

Owners must ensure the equipment is regularly inspected by an authorized technician at least once a year. Follow operating and safety guidelines strictly to prevent hazards.

**Overview of Cooking and HACCP Functions**

In SOFT mode (soft function deactivated), food is heated rapidly, ideal for items with high thermal conductivity, preventing burning during the heating process. When activated, the SOFT function adjusts heating based on the specific type of food, ensuring that items do not stick and can be monitored via the CLOCK TIME (AZ) display and the timer (AT). The control switch (S) allows for HACCP appliance operation, which can be analyzed using the integrated THERMACAM.

The HACCP (C) indicator light and the cooking status lights (LC) help clarify the current cooking state. The process is managed using various buttons (T for time, D for duration, and Z for adjustments). When cooking is in progress, indicators will flash to signal adjustments. The system tracks the heating process, switching off when necessary or upon manual intervention using switches (DT or ZT).

**Mechanical Tilting Feature**

The mechanical tilting option (H) can be activated with the switch (S), allowing the appliance to tilt for easier emptying. This functionality allows for swift operation, with clockwise and counterclockwise rotation based on the action required at the switch (K).

**Operating Instructions**

For effective operation, the heating and cooking parameters should be adjusted based on the type of food being processed. Recommended temperatures include 212°F (100°C) for boiling and specific ranges for roasting meats: 391°F (200°C) initially, then reduced to 230-320°F (160°C) for optimal results. For poultry and steaming, temperatures between 284-320°F (160°C) are preferable.

Proper loading techniques are critical; food should not exceed an inch below the heating element to prevent burning. The SOFT function is particularly useful in maintaining the integrity of delicate foods during cooking. 

**Cleaning Procedures**

The equipment should be cleaned thoroughly, especially after high-heat cooking processes. Periodic maintenance involves using a commercial non-corrosive cleaner for the housing and interiors. The surfaces should be allowed to cool before cleaning. Avoid harsh materials that may scratch or damage the appliance, and opt for cloths or absorbent materials for cleaning grease and residues.

**Troubleshooting**

In case of issues, the appliance will display diagnostic codes (E1, E2, E5, etc.) corresponding to various faults such as overheating, thermostat failures, or HACCP communication errors. Users should consult these codes to identify and address problems or seek professional service as needed.

**Maintenance of Commercial Kitchen Appliances**

High caution should be taken when using acidic or abrasive cleaners to protect appliances from damage. Excess grease and residues must be managed properly to avoid malfunction. Regular maintenance is essential for safe, efficient operation in a commercial kitchen environment.
