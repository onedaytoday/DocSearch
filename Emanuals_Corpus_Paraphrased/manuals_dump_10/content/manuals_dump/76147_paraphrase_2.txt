# Troubleshooting Guide

### Important
To avoid unnecessary service costs, please refer to the troubleshooting tips below.

### Troubleshooting Steps
If there is no power supply, check the household supply and ensure lights are functioning. If lights are out or dim, further troubleshooting is required.

### Energy Saving Tips
To minimize energy consumption during cooking, use the blower at lower settings. It's inefficient to run heating or cooling systems while cooking. Regularly clean the blower, and consider turning it off during cooking. Select appropriate cookware that matches the size of the heating element to optimize cooking efficiency.
