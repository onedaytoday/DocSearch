**Technical Instructions for Operation and Maintenance**

To operate the device, press the HV button to increase to the desired setting. Then, press PROGRAM and hold for a few seconds until it transitions to STANDBY. Ensure that both cleaning equipment and office spaces are ready. To activate TURBO mode, press the relevant button and follow with PROGRAM and STANDBY for quality assurance. Repeatedly monitor the light indicators: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, and TURBO, corresponding to increasing power levels. If returning to a prior PROGRAM, ensure the systems reset from STANDBY as necessary.

During servicing, be cautious of high voltage and ensure that the device is off before maintenance. Use the appropriate tools, such as a torx screwdriver, to perform necessary tasks. Keep in mind that some components may have sharp edges; handle with care to avoid injury.

Regular maintenance is crucial for efficient operation. If any crackling sounds are noted, this may indicate high voltage arcing, necessitating immediate attention. Inspect and clean all wires and filters routinely to prevent buildup and ensure optimal airflow.

**Key Service Alerts:**
- Performance issues may arise from malfunctioning switches, dirty filters, or saturated components. If issues persist, consult the service manual.
- Always ensure that connections are secure and that software is up-to-date to avoid short-circuit risk.

**Replacement and Cleaning:**
Routine cleaning of pre-filters and other key components is advised. Avoid forcibly pulling on any parts without releasing clips first.

**General Maintenance Recommendations:**
Ensure the device is turned off and unplugged before any adjustment to avoid potential electrical shocks. Follow prescribed cleaning and service guidelines for all applicable components. Regular inspections are essential to maintain functionality and safety.
