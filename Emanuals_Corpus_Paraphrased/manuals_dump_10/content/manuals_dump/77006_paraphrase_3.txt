### Mouse Operation Instructions

To interact with the OSD (On-Screen Display), use the mouse to click or scroll. Clicking the wheel will toggle the display or clear it. The OSD will disappear when the wheel is rotated or clicked. If another device is in use, ensure the supply is properly connected; otherwise, functionality may not be guaranteed. Consult the reference sections P.18 and P.27 for further information on the OSD.

### Unit Installation

For mounting the unit, utilize the VB-1000 UL or the UL-approved hardware. Connect the HV-C1000XG to the power supply using the included cord, and turn the switch ON. If the switch is OFF or the supply is disconnected, projected images may be out of focus or insufficiently illuminated. Adjustments can be made using the DIP switches to set the factory defaults or modify shooting settings.

### Operation Procedures

To power the unit wirelessly, press the [POWER] button. If the unit shuts down immediately, wait a few seconds before powering it back on. The [LAMP] indicator will glow for roughly 30 seconds, and you can use the [ZOOM TELE] and [ZOOM WIDE] buttons for zoom adjustments. The [FOCUS N/F] buttons facilitate focus adjustments, and pressing [AF] (Auto Focus) will finalize settings. Turn off the unit using the [POWER] button, which will switch the LED indicator to red.

### Functionality Overview

For lighting adjustments, use the wireless remote to toggle the [LAMP] function on or off. Adjust zoom levels with the [ZOOM TELE] and [ZOOM WIDE] buttons. The unit supports various operational modes, including color selections and image rotations via dedicated buttons. The BLACK/WHITE toggle is engaged by pressing [COLOR/B&W] on the remote.

### Image Adjustment

The [POSI/NEGA] button changes the image from positive to negative. Contrast settings can be adjusted using the [CONTRAST] option. When the [IMAGE ROTATION] button is pressed, the display rotates counterclockwise. 

If the [PAUSE] button is activated, it will halt ongoing functions until pressed again. Functions such as zoom, focus, and contrast remain active until altered.

### F.A.M. and Iris Controls

To minimize artifacts, press the [F.A.M.] button to select or resume the F.A.M. function. Iris adjustment is available through the [IRIS OPEN] and [IRIS CLOSE] buttons—[IRIS NORMAL] can restore default settings.

Refer to the OSD documentation (P.27) for detailed operational guidance and setup.

### Paraphrased Text

When the wireless button is pressed, the AUTO FOCUS function engages automatically. Once focusing is complete, the AUTO FOCUS function is released, and the device transitions to a focus-free state. The AUTO FOCUS may struggle with certain conditions, such as shiny surfaces or bright backgrounds, and in these instances, users will need to switch to MANUAL FOCUS. Users can adjust the FOCUS to NEAR or FAR using the provided controls. If the wireless ZOOM buttons ([ZOOMTELE] or [ZOOMWIDE]) are pressed, the AUTO FOCUS operation is temporarily halted. Upon completion of another AUTO FOCUS process, the device should function normally again.

For 3-D applications, the NEAR or FAR focus can be adjusted using the wireless control to achieve precise focusing. The functions can be modified using various buttons listed, such as [ZOOM TELE] and others, to quickly adapt settings.

The preset operation involves saving specific settings, including IRIS, White balance, Lighting conditions, and Image Rotation. To store a preset, press the [PRESET SET] button on the wireless control and select the desired MEMORY NO. To retrieve these settings later, use the [PRESET CALL] followed by the MEMORY NO.

To manage memory, the [IMAGE SET] button allows users to save configurations, while the [IMAGE CALL] button retrieves them. The system allows for saved settings to be activated with a simple press. Software including the TWAIN interface can be installed from the provided CD for PC integration.

The On-Screen Display (OSD) provides real-time operating information, accessible by pressing the [MENU] button on the wireless controller. Users can navigate the OSD using the ARROW buttons. If the OSD is active, certain functionalities may be limited, and the interface will display only pertinent items.

The Color/B&W selection allows users to toggle between color modes and adjust settings for specific lighting conditions. Factory settings can also be restored with ease.

For RS-232C communication, the device can connect to a PC using the appropriate cable. Detailed specifications and commands are provided for seamless integration and operation.

### TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDELINES

**Symptoms and Verification Steps:**
1. Check if the TV is properly connected to the AC power supply.
2. Ensure that the power switch is turned ON.
3. If the screen displays only black or white, verify the switch. If the switch is turned ON but then immediately turned OFF, wait a few seconds before switching it back ON.
4. Adjust the focus between the TELE and WIDE settings.
5. If using AUTO FOCUS, ensure the system is configured for the correct wireless type, such as PAL or NTSC. Incorrect settings may lead to a black-and-white display. Switch the type to "P" for proper operation.
6. If brightness appears too high, adjust the [LAMP] settings or configuration.
7. Check for interference that may affect the TV or CCD image, which might become visible on LCD screens. Manual adjustment of the clock may be necessary.
