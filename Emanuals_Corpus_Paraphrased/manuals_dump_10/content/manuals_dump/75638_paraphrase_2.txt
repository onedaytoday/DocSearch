### Appliance Operation and Maintenance

#### Powering Off the Appliance

To turn off the appliance, press and hold the ON/OFF button for several seconds until it powers down. It’s important to ensure the appliance is properly switched off to avoid unintentional closing or the growth of mold in the closed environment. For effective operation, consult the cleaning and defrosting section regularly. 

#### Temperature Settings

When selecting temperatures, note that the recommended settings are typically between C and C degrees. This helps maintain the freshness of food. The appliance operates best with a full compartment, so ensure it’s filled but avoid overcrowding as this can hinder airflow.

To maintain food quality, cover items to avoid contamination and moisture loss. Group items wisely, as excessive exposure can lead to spoilage.
