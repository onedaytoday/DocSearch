The cold storage system features coolers designed to operate between -10°C and -21°C with varying thicknesses, incorporating either built-in or modular assembly. This particular model includes a pre-charged cooling construction with advanced injection technology that enhances performance and features high-quality, prepainted polyurethane insulation, free from CFCs and HCFCs. 

The coolers are designed with rounded corners for safety and include a fast-fit assembly that facilitates airtight sealing using high-grade PVC. They can operate efficiently under high ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) using refrigerant R404A and have options for high/low efficiency.

Defrosting is optimized through heated mechanisms to minimize ice buildup, and the internal lighting meets IP54 standards. The unit is equipped with an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting control, and an adjustable thermostat. It includes a right-hinged door with smooth, rounded contours for effective insulation and enhanced energy efficiency. Compliance with HACCP standards is ensured, and the cooler includes optional shelving accessories.
