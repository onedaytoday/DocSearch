To set up the following equipment: a DVB-S TV with a Conditional Access Module (CI CAM), ensure that you have the software and PDF CD-ROM provided. Connect the LNB to the TV, as indicated in the user manual, and connect the AC input accordingly. This package enables you to record broadcasts soon after installation.

After unpacking, follow the provided instructions to connect an RG-6 cable from the LNB to the ANT IN on the DVBS TV with CI. The setup will proceed automatically; please adhere to the on-screen prompts. If you're using DVB broadcasting, ensure you have the appropriate CAM for your service.

Once the TV is powered on, you can access the on-screen menu to manage recordings and utilize the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) via the software. Note: If you need to switch to a different type of CAM, please refer to the instructions for selecting the appropriate option. Additionally, you may install the software from the CD-ROM and access the PDF documents for further guidance once the installation is complete.
