Here's a more concise and technical paraphrase of the provided text:

To operate the system, start by selecting the appropriate options for your settings, then press the designated buttons. If necessary, toggle the switch to turn off the light indicator, particularly if the system is locked. In cases where the appliance is hot or has malfunctioned, ensure to address these issues accordingly.

When sorting laundry, separate items into categories such as whites, colors, and synthetics. New colored items should be washed separately from whites to maintain their brightness. Stains, such as grease or lipstick, may require pre-treatment with specific stain removers before washing. Use bleach cautiously, adhering to guidelines for both whites and colored fabrics.

Select the appropriate washing program based on the fabric types and soil levels. Programs include options for cotton, synthetics, delicates, and specific temperature ranges (e.g., cold, 40°C, 60°C). Incorporate prewash and extra rinse features as necessary.

For cleaning and maintenance, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply. Regularly clean the interior and exterior surfaces and check hoses for any clogs or damage. If the appliance requires emergency emptying, follow the outlined procedures to ensure safety.

For error indications or service requests, refer to troubleshooting guidelines, paying attention to the lights and sounds emitted by the system. If issues persist, consult professional service assistance.
