**IQ-Touch™ Interface Instructions**

The IQ-Touch™ interface requires an active touch to function. There are three options relating to water and crushed ice; each option lights up when activated. Here are the functionalities:

- **Food Light Activation**: Press and hold for three seconds to turn on the food light, which conserves energy by restricting activation.
- **Sound Control**: The tones can be muted or turned on based on user preference. Sounds are automatically muted when a warning is active. To reset sounds to factory settings, hold for three seconds.
- **Cooling Function**: The cooling function can be turned off or modified through specific button presses. 

**Shelf Adjustment and Care**

To adjust shelves for optimal storage of fresh food, use a Phillips screwdriver to tighten or loosen the shelf spacers. This allows for secure placement and easy cleaning. The shelves are designed with a built-in mechanism to catch and hold food securely.

**Meat Care Tips**

When storing meat, ensure that storage conditions are appropriate to maintain freshness. Properly organized shelves can hold various food items efficiently.

**Perfect Temperature Designation (PTD)**

The Perfect Temperature Designation (PTD) is designed to keep food either cooler or warmer than standard fresh food temperatures. Upon initial setup, ensure that PTD is activated as needed and controlled through the On/Off switch, with temperatures adjustable between 28°F and 42°F.

**Cleaning Instructions for the Perfect System**

To clean, use a soft cloth and avoid harsh chemicals. Components of the system can be removed for cleaning and should be dried thoroughly after washing.

**Water Supply Setup**

The advanced water supply features should be connected properly upon initial setup, or malfunctions can occur. The built-in shutoff mechanism should be tested to ensure proper installation.

**Ice Production and Maintenance**

For the ice production system, ensure that it is cleaned periodically to prevent clogs or malfunctions. Familiarize yourself with the sound indicators that notify you of operational issues.

**Important Notes**

1. Regularly check the water filter and replace it as recommended to ensure the quality of water dispensed.
2. If the system begins to malfunction, investigating the water supply connection may resolve the issue. 

Maintaining these guidelines will ensure optimal operation of your IQ-Touch™ appliances and promote efficient food storage and safety.

### Advanced TM Information

The TM technology has been rigorously evaluated and certified by NSF International, a reputable non-profit organization focused on public health. The PureAdvantage TM system meets ANSI/NSF standards for specified performance in reducing contaminants, either with or without disinfection. 

**Operational Instructions:**
To utilize the PureAdvantage TM system, ensure the supply is turned off prior to activation. Engage the switch to control the flow of water. During operation, you should hear the system release air from the housing, which is normal. Keep the housing clean by turning it on for three seconds to flush out any trapped air.

**Food Storage Advice:**
To maintain the freshness of foods, avoid overcrowding shelves as this can hinder proper cooling. Store meats securely, ideally away from other food items to prevent cross-contamination. Foods should be sealed tightly in airtight containers to prevent freezer burn. Organize items to allow for optimal airflow, particularly for hard-to-freeze foods, and avoid placing items too close to heat sources such as sunlight or appliances that emit heat.

**Normal Operating Sounds:**
The appliance may produce various sounds during operation, which indicate normal functioning. You might notice the defrost heater making a hissing noise or hear clicking when the cooling begins or stops. Additionally, high-pitched sounds could indicate airflow as ice forms or melts. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**
To protect your investment, clean the interior and exterior regularly, using appropriate cleaning agents. Avoid abrasive materials and cleaners containing bleach unless explicitly recommended. Ensure to turn off and unplug the unit before cleaning to prevent damage or injury.

**Warranty Information:**
This warranty covers defects in materials and workmanship from the date of purchase. Repairs or replacements are the sole remedies provided under this warranty, which excludes incidental or consequential damages. Limitations may vary by location, and you may have additional rights based on your state laws.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
In case of issues, check for common problems like power disconnections or blown fuses. Ensure the cooling settings are correctly adjusted. Regularly inspect the seals and cleanliness of the lights and components for optimal performance. If problems persist, contact a qualified service representative for guidance.

### Water and Moisture/Frost Correction Guidelines

**Water Collection and Correction**: Ensure the water collection area is properly covered. The Perfect Correction Connector should display "CE." When the section is activated, pressing three buttons simultaneously will show "LOC" after a few seconds. Frequent weather changes may lead to frost and internal condensation, which can be exacerbated by cleaning issues in covered areas. Regularly clean to prevent water accumulation in these sections.

**Ice Management**: Ensure that the water supply connected to your household is sufficient and not restricted. If ice accumulation occurs, check to ensure the water supply is fully seated and unrestricted. To manage ice properly, adjust the switch and follow operational instructions. If items are too warm, turn off the household supply as necessary, and ensure items are tightly sealed to prevent clogging.

**Ice Correction and Water Supply**: The unit must be properly connected to the household water supply. If the supply is closed, the unit may not function correctly. Address fluctuations and ensure proper connection to avoid issues with ice. If the system is overloaded, allow it to thaw, and then perform maintenance to keep the supply clean. Listen for clicks to confirm the correct operation of the system.

**Light Correction Issues**: If the correction light is not on, check the food storage area for contamination that may block the light. Clean the light switch and the track regularly to ensure proper function. If necessary, use the section switch to reset the system and refresh the light.

For further maintenance, follow the cleaning tips and instructions provided, checking regularly for any issues with connections or dirt buildup that could affect performance.
