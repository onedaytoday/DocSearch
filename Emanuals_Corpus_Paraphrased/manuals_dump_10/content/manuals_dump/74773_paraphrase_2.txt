**Note:** This appliance is equipped with advanced no-frost technology, ensuring efficient cooling and allowing for automatic defrosting of the interior. Regular monitoring and adherence to these instructions will maintain optimal functionality.

The appliance features buttons that connect to the system, allowing users to toggle between the CURRENT and DESIRED temperatures, with options to adjust (WARMER) or (COLDER). When pressed, the buttons indicate the DESIRED temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). If activated, the system returns to the CURRENT temperature, which will match the DESIRED settings. 

The CURRENT temperature is shown numerically, while if the FROSTMATIC or COOLMATIC functions are engaged, they will indicate operational status through flashing displays. The COOLMATIC function appears when activated, whereas the FROSTMATIC status displays concurrently. If the (WARMER) or (COLDER) buttons are pressed for a few seconds, an SF warning may appear, indicating food is partially frozen or defrosted, along with any warnings if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold. 

To start the appliance, press the ON/OFF button, which signals operational readiness through indicator lights. Should the power be interrupted, holding the ON/OFF button for several seconds can turn off the appliance or reset the settings. 

The temperature settings must be respected: if the selected operation exceeds the DEVIATED temperature, a warning light may activate. The COOLMATIC function is useful for rapidly cooling products or parties; pressing it will maintain a DESIRED temperature for a specified duration.

The device protects thawing food by maintaining cold temperatures. If the FROSTMATIC feature is activated, it operates under a fast freeze mode, showing relevant information about its capacity. To switch it off, users can press the FROSTMATIC button.

Warnings for food temperature management also exist. The system notifies users that food items should not exceed specified temperatures or may emerge with compromised quality. Technical warnings (like error codes F7 or F8) indicate issues that require service attention. 

Operational guidelines suggest that maintaining the appliance's indicated capacity is crucial to food preservation and safety, revealing the importance of adhering to recommended storage periods for different items. Additionally, using airtight storage for sensitive items is advised to maximize freshness.

**Cleaning and Maintenance of the Interior**

Regular cleaning of the interior is essential. **Caution:** Ensure the appliance is turned off before cleaning to avoid electric shock. Disconnect the power by using the OFF switch or unplugging the device. Cleaning should be done using appropriate cleaners and while avoiding any harsh substances that may damage the surfaces. 

To enhance cleaning efficiency, activate the FROSTMATIC function for a few hours before cleaning, and cover items with newspaper to prevent them from being disturbed. Turn off the device and press the ON/OFF button for approximately ten seconds to reset it. Use a soft cloth and suitable cleaning agents to wipe surfaces and the back of the appliance, ensuring that they remain free of buildup.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**

For malfunction issues, follow these guidelines. Only trained professionals should conduct repairs. If the appliance enters stand-by mode and displays warning indicators (e.g., C or partial thaw alerts), remedial actions must be taken as outlined in the manual. Regularly check for system malfunctions and be aware of warning lights indicating improper operation.

To address issues like frost buildup, assess the load within twelve hours of operation. Ensure that food items are properly sealed, and if they are warmer than 50°C, allow them to cool before placing them in the appliance.

**Operational Adjustments**

To activate the FROSTMATIC function for quick cooling of fresh foods, follow the provided operational guidelines. If the appliance shows indicators of malfunction (e.g., warning alerts like F7 or F8), check the settings and ensure proper usage as per instructions.

For safety, avoid handling the appliance during operation, particularly if indicators show electrical issues. Ensure the appliance is connected to a proper power supply (V, W specifications) and is in compliance with local regulations regarding electrical appliances.
