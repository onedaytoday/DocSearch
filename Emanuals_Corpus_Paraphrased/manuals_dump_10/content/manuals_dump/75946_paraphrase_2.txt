**COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Functions**

The COOLMATIC function provides efficient cooling and can be activated by selecting the desired temperature. When the COOLMATIC feature is switched on, a light indicates the ongoing cooling process, which can run for a set number of hours based on the initial temperature chosen. To manually adjust the COOLMATIC function, the light will change to reflect the actual temperature inside. 

The FROSTMATIC function is designed to freeze fresh food items quickly and to protect previously frozen goods. Activation of this function is indicated by a yellow light, and it can also be turned off manually after a predetermined number of hours. 

To switch off the appliance, hold both the ON/OFF buttons for several seconds. Should there be an interruption in the power supply, the appliance will shut off until the issue is resolved. For defrosting purposes, ensure that the compartment remains closed to avoid temperature fluctuations.

**Maintaining Freshness**

To optimize storage, adjust shelf heights according to the items being stored. Position taller items like bottles towards the back and smaller items at the front, ensuring efficient use of space. 

**Accessories and Food Storage Guidelines**

Utilize the provided accessories to store bottles correctly. Always place food items on the lower shelves to maintain a colder temperature, especially for perishable items. Check your thermometer regularly to ensure conditions are optimal, ideally below the recommended temperature. 

**Warnings and Notifications**

The appliance may issue visual and acoustic warnings if temperatures rise above the recommended levels. These alerts will deactivate once temperatures normalize. The warning signals can also be manually turned off if necessary. 

**Defrosting Process**

Defrosting should occur regularly to maintain efficiency. Remove frost buildup from the interior to ensure optimal operation. Always adhere to safety guidelines when cleaning or defrosting to prevent hazards. 

**Cleaning Protocols**

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the power source. Use non-abrasive cleaning agents to avoid damaging surfaces. Regularly inspect and maintain the unit according to the specified guidelines to ensure its longevity and functionality.
