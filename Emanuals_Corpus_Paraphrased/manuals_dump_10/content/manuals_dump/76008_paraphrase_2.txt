**Washer Locking Screw Assembly Instructions:**

This section outlines the correct assembly of the washer locking screw and sawtooth head. To connect the sawtooth, ensure it is positioned properly and secure it by turning the screw clockwise. This should be done without any motion in the assembly. When unscrewing, turn the screw counterclockwise to detach.

**Operational Switches:**

Start by ensuring the STOP switch (F1) is in the "I" position, then close the throttle (F2). Ensure fluid flow is consistent and avoid interruptions, utilizing only authorized service centers to maintain optimal performance.

**Routine Maintenance:**

To prevent overheating, clean the equipment regularly, especially after intense usage that may result in grease buildup. Maintain all components every three months, ensuring the shoulder straps and hip support are adjusted properly for comfort.

**Cutting Operations:**

During cutting, avoid hitting the ground excessively to maintain blade integrity. If necessary, adjust your grip and throttle management to enhance cutting efficiency. 

**Service Recommendations:**

Always follow proper cleaning protocols to sustain performance over extended periods. If components show wear, refer to the assembly instructions for replacements. 

**Safety Precautions:**

Avoid kickback incidents by ensuring the cutting head does not touch the ground during operation. Use protective shields while working with the sawtooth to prevent accidents.
