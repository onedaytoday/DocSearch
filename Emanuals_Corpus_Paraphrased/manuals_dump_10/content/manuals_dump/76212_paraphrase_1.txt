The Chimney Wall-Mount RH36WC55GS is expertly crafted with high-quality materials, making it attractive and easy to clean. It offers effective CFM performance along with built-in lighting for improved visibility while cooking. The LCD display provides a user-friendly interface for operations, including clock settings. This stainless steel wall-mount hood is designed for ducted installation but can also be configured for ductless operation with optional charcoal filters (EICFW60GS) and comes with the necessary wiring for 120V service. Important installation height and spacing guidelines should be followed as outlined in the product instructions available at www.electroluxappliances.ca. The specifications include options for microwaves, dishwashers, and other appliance compatibility. Cold weather installations require specific considerations, and straight ducting for thermal efficiency is advised. Appliance grounding is essential, and all electrical connections should adhere to local building codes.
