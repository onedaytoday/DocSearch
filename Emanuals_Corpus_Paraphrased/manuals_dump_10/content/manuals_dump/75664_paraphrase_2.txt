The system integrates assisted components that enhance performance and efficiency. It features AISI stainless steel construction, with adjustable base, top, and back heights for simplified access and maintenance of the interior. The unit allows for complete defrosting and thorough cleaning, facilitated by a rounded interior design and convenient access points (without obstruction). The forced cooling at +43Â°C ensures uniform temperature distribution, and the high-density expanded polyurethane insulation, created with cyclopentane injection, provides long-lasting thermal efficiency. 

The interior is designed to accommodate GN self-closing containers and includes a recessed layout for easy operation. It is equipped with a microswitch to deactivate the system when doors are opened, and uses optional CFC and HCFC-free refrigerants, complying with international standards and CE regulations.
