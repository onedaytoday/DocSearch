**MAN-RAVIG Continuous (ECLC)**

The ECLC interfaces with J2/ and connects to J2/2 (ECLRET). The operational reference is 3.75V at J2/ (ECLC) concerning J2/2 (ECLRET). The ECLC operates internally whenever it exceeds a specified voltage. The ECLC is designed to operate at a minimum voltage threshold of V. Connections exist at J2/ (ECLC) and J2/2 (ECLRET). At ECLC values above K, the system is controlled internally by the amplifier.

**(ECLP)**

The ECLP connects to J2/3 (ECLP) and J2/2 (ECLRET). The operating reference is 3.75V at J2/3 (ECLP) with respect to J2/2 (ECLRET). The ECLP functions effectively when its voltage surpasses a defined threshold. The ECLP operates at a minimum voltage also denoted as V.

The connection at J2/3 (ECLP) links to J2/2 (ECLRET). The system is influenced by: Ip(new) for ECLP. At ECLP values exceeding .4K, the internal control by the amplifier is activated.

**(LM)**

For connections J2/7 and J2/8, the system is latched whenever a Short condition is detected, temporarily disconnecting from J2/9. The recommended configurations involve selections between J2/9 and J2/ for the optocoupler functionality associated with the amplifier. Engaging the input at a high level will immediately activate the LM remote features.

**MAN-RAVIG Indications**

The system provides the following status indicators: Function, Option AOK, SO1, SO2, SO3. "Amplifier OK" status is not applicable (AOK). There is short protection available, which is evident when the input is engaged. Note that without proper indications, the readings can be misleading, particularly with respect to outputs.
