Thank you for choosing our rechargeable cleaner, designed for both light and household use. This device operates efficiently in dry conditions.

### Key Features/Accessories:
- **On/Off Switch**: Make sure to turn off the cleaner when not in use to conserve battery and ensure safety.
- **Charging Indicator**: The light will activate when charging and should only be serviced by authorized personnel. Keep the cleaner away from children and individuals who may not manage it safely.

### Charging Station:
- The charging station should be powered off when not in use. Charging typically requires several hours, especially during the initial charge to reach full capacity. Make sure the cleaner is properly charged before usage. There's a compartment beneath the charging station to store cables neatly. The cleaner can be mounted to the station securely.

### Maintenance and Cleaning:
- **Emptying the Cleaner**: When the waste indicator shows that it's full, empty it promptly to maintain optimal suction. Release the waste container, dispose of the contents, and reassemble securely.
