**NOTE:** Always ensure the cooker hood is properly grounded and connected according to the guidelines to prevent electrical hazards.

To secure the first component as shown, and from the upper section, utilize the provided fixing screws as illustrated. For the splashback (optional), ensure it is attached at the indicated height relative to the cooking area. First, position the splashback, then secure it using the supplied fixing screws. If the splashback is installed with or without a cooker, utilize both the top and additional fixing screws provided. 

For installations involving hollow walls or boards, use the appropriate fixing screws. The top section should accommodate screws approximately as specified in the ELECTRICAL CONNECTION section. 

For optimal performance, ducting should be installed as efficiently as possible. The ducting must comply with British standards, specifically DIN 4102-B1, when venting to the exterior. If using a charcoal filter, ensure it is installed correctly. The extraction system must facilitate proper airflow, with any bends kept minimal to maintain performance efficiency. 

The chimney assembly will include the components shown in section (S), which need to be secured as instructed. Adjustments at the top may be necessary during installation to ensure a proper fit before securing everything with the provided screws. Please refer to the installation diagrams for precise placement and securing methods.
