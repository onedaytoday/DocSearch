The EWFLW65H series washers—models TS, SS, and IW—feature advanced Wave-Touch technology, offering more options compared to other washers, including a three-foot capacity. These washers ensure smooth and efficient operation, making them ideal for energy-efficient laundry care. They are ENERGY STAR certified and come with various settings such as Soft-Arc Wave-Touch controls, LCD displays, and multiple washing cycles tailored for different fabric types, including Duty, Whites, Colors, Normal, Active Wear, Delicates, and Custom options. 

The EWFLW65H models also feature a prewash and bleach option, as well as a high spin RPM. The installation height and requirements must be followed according to the included product specifications to ensure proper grounding and electrical connection (120V service with ground wire). Clearance is necessary for built-in and custom cabinetry installations. 

Specific hose requirements and water supply connections must be adhered to, including using a three-prong cord as per ANSI/NFPA standards. Furthermore, the temperature of the water supply should not fall below 60°F. The model is designed to accommodate various installation scenarios, whether built-in or countertop, with careful attention to clearance and hose lengths to facilitate efficient operation. 

Specifications are subject to change, and updates may be made to align with industry standards.
