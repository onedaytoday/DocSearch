### Chillers

Chillers are designed to cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively minimizing bacterial growth. This rapid chilling process not only preserves food quality but also enhances safety by ensuring a significant reduction in temperature. The chilling systems are constructed with built-in features for comprehensive performance.

**Operating Modes:**
- **Soft Chilling:** +2°C 
- **Chilling:** +12°C

The ARTE system is activated to cool food down to +3°C continuously, with temperature monitoring during food insertion or operation. The equipment includes built-in UV features or optional accessories, as well as defrosting functions. User-friendly displays provide countdowns and service information (P1, P2) for each operating mode, allowing for efficient monitoring. Operational data related to HACCP standards is recorded for compliance, even in case of an abnormal termination.

**Performance:**
The efficiency of the chilling process is dependent on the type of food being chilled and the chilling method employed (NF).

**Construction and Finishing:**
The chassis is made of AISI material with a high polyurethane insulation thickness that is HCFC-free and meets ISO standards. Features include rounded corners and IP20 protection, ensuring durability and safety.

**Technical Data:**
- **Productivity:** Compliant with NF and UK chilling regulations
- **Capacity:** Defined by dimensions and GN configurations
- **Installation:** Requires electric connection and plumbing

**Included Accessories:**
- Single sensor probes for chillers/freezers
- 3-sensor probe options
- Various trolley configurations and racks for food storage
- HACCP options for enhanced compliance tracking
- Advanced connection kits for additional features

Chillers are certified under the NF HYGIENE ALIMENTAIRE by AFAQ AFNOR, ensuring compliance with cleaning and thermal performance standards.
