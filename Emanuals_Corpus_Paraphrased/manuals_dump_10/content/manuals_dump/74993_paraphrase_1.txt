This paraphrased version maintains the instruction's original meanings while clarifying certain points for clarity and technical accuracy.

**Preheating and Cooking Guidelines**

**Grilling**  
Preheat the grill for meat or toasting. Ensure the heat is set correctly; the food should be positioned centrally above the heat source. For optimal results, refer to the "Service Force Grilling Chart" for recommended grilling times for various items such as toast, rashers, chops, and whole fish like trout or mackerel.

**Using the Second Oven**  
The second oven is designed for slow cooking, baking, or toasting, with a temperature setting of 100°C. Follow the instructions in the user guide (D2160-1G) to turn on the oven and check for the internal light indicating it's operating correctly. Ensure proper placement of shelving, allowing for adequate clearance and circulation of heat.

**Hints and Tips**  
Shelf placement should always be counted from the top down. Maintain a minimum distance from the top of the food to the oven's heating element. This improves heat distribution, which is crucial for baking items like Yorkshire pudding. Centralize the food and leave space around the tray/dish for easier cleaning. Avoid using enamelware or heavily polished cookware as it may affect browning.

**Main Fan Oven**  
When using the main fan oven, preheating is essential to achieve the recommended cooking temperatures. It is advised to preheat, as cooking times may increase without doing so. For batch baking, ensure spacing between trays for even cooking.

**Defrosting Function**  
This function allows for defrosting foods without applying heat, particularly suited for items covered with icing or frost. Follow guidelines to ensure safe and effective thawing, especially for meat, which should be cooked immediately after defrosting. 

**Food Safety Tips**  
When purchasing and preparing food, maintain proper hygiene to prevent bacterial contamination. Store perishable items promptly, ensuring they are covered to reduce exposure. Follow recommended cooking temperatures to ensure thorough cooking.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Before cleaning the oven, allow the cooling fan to operate until the oven cools down. Avoid using bleach-based cleaners, which may damage finishes. Clean the exterior surfaces with a gentle cloth, adhering strictly to the provided cleaning instructions. For golden finishes, use specific cleaners to prevent dulling.

**Cleaning Oven Components**  
For the inner workings of the oven, follow the cleaning guidelines closely, ensuring all materials used are suitable and non-abrasive. Always take caution when removing internal components like the glass doors, as improper handling may cause damage.

By adhering to these structured guidelines, you can ensure effective cooking results and maintain your oven's longevity.
