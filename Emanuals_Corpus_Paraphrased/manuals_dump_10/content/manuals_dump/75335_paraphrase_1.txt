Sure! Hereâ€™s a paraphrased version that maintains the original meaning:

The cake is overcooked if it rises too high. To address this, ensure the batter is evenly distributed in the baking pan and that the grease is applied properly. Preheat the oven using the Convection setting and prepare the appropriate shelf for cooking, such as for gratins or ready meals. When cooking chips, utilize the Convection setting to make sure they heat evenly.

For roasting meat, follow the specific instructions regarding thickness to avoid burning. Turn off the heat if necessary and monitor the roasting process to ensure optimal results.

When cleaning the oven, ensure it is turned off and cooled before you begin. Pay attention to avoid high-pressure cleaning methods or abrasive materials that could damage the surface. Use a soft cloth for maintenance, and do so while considering manufacturer guidelines.

For handling lights, make sure to switch off power before attempting repairs, and be cautious of electric shocks. If the oven does not operate correctly, consult the user manual for troubleshooting assistance or seek professional help.

Other guidelines include proper disposal of appliances and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Maintain a record of your appliance details for warranty purposes, and contact customer service for any issues. 

Make sure to keep safety procedures in mind while performing maintenance or repairs and adhere to all manufacturer's instructions.
