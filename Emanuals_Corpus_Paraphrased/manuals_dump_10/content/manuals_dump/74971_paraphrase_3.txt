Here’s a concise, technical paraphrase of your text:

**Microwave Operation Instructions**

To operate the microwave, turn the rotary dial to select the desired cooking function. The light will indicate the current setting. Press the START/QUICK button to initiate the cooking process, which can count down in seconds. Refer to the chart for varying wattage settings for tasks such as defrosting, reheating, or cooking. Ensure food is covered appropriately, using heat-resistant materials when necessary, to prevent splatters and to promote even heating.

To defrost, select the appropriate program and manually turn food items midway through the process for optimal results. Follow guidelines for cooking specific items, such as poultry or meat, and always ensure food is cooked thoroughly to avoid cold spots.

For cleaning, allow the appliance to cool and use a damp cloth to wipe the interior and exterior surfaces—avoid abrasive materials that may scratch. Regular maintenance of the turntable and ensuring proper functioning are important for effective operation.

If the appliance requires servicing, contact AEG Customer Service. Keep a record of the model and serial number found on the rating plate for reference during inquiries.
