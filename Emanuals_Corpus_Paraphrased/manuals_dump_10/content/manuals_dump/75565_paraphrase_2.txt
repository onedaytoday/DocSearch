## Instructions for the Cooker

### Introduction
This document serves as a guide to the British Standard C.E., in compliance with Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It is essential to thoroughly read these instructions before using the cooker to ensure safe and effective operation. The cooker is designed specifically for food preparation, and this manual provides important information regarding usage and safety measures.

### Rating Plate
The rating plate is located either at the front of the appliance, on the top cavity, or on the back/top edge. It provides important specifications and operational guidelines.

### Lighting the Hotplate
To ignite the hotplate, engage the highest setting and release the ignition after a few seconds. If there is any indication of fire spreading, immediately cover with appropriate cookware. The hotplate has a safety cut-off feature that shuts it off if closed, preventing gas leaks.

### Cooking and Heat Management
When cooking, adjust the heat from 'OFF' to 'LOW' and then to 'HIGH,' depending on the food being prepared. Use the high setting for quick-cooking items like toast and lower settings for thicker dishes. Food should be checked regularly to avoid burning.

### Preheating and Cooking Heights
Consider the thickness of food items when determining shelf placement. Itâ€™s recommended to preheat the cooker before starting to ensure even cooking. Position food based on its thickness to maintain optimal cooking temperatures.

### Instructions for Specific Cooking Procedures
- **Roasting:** Avoid covering meat while roasting as this can hinder heat circulation and affect cooking time. 
- **Thawing and Cooking Times:** Always thaw food thoroughly before cooking, as specified in the cooking charts.

### General Cooking Advice
Keep the hotplate clean to prevent any fire hazards. When cooking tougher cuts of meat, use a meat thermometer to ensure they reach the recommended internal temperature before serving. Adjust heat carefully and monitor cooking times for the best results.

### Safety Precautions 
Always cover pots and pans while cooking to prevent splatters and potential fire risks. Keep the cooking area clear of flammable materials and regularly check the functionality of the safety features. 

This manual outlines essential steps for safe and efficient cooking, including detailed instructions on lighting the hotplate and using varying heat settings effectively.

### Cooking Instructions and Safety Guidelines

To prepare soups or cook food, place the pot on the hotplate and start the cooking process. If using tight beans or meat, ensure they are thoroughly cooked. It's important to reduce the heat as necessary and let the food simmer. To thicken meat-based dishes, cornflour can be incorporated, ensuring there are no curdling issues with other cooking products. Avoid reheating food multiple times; it should only be reheated once, and ensure it has cooled before doing so in an oven or microwave. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Keep the appliance clean to prevent any fire hazards and ensure optimal performance. Use only recommended cleaners and avoid abrasive materials that could damage the brass plating. Clean the hotplate surface with a suitable cloth and check the crowns regularly, using appropriate cleaning methods to prevent buildup. If the crowns appear burnt, clean them with non-abrasive materials.

### Shelving and Installation Instructions

Follow the installation instructions carefully, paying attention to the recommended heights and positioning to avoid any fire risks. Ensure that all screws are securely fastened, and regularly check that the unit is in good condition. Be cautious of high temperatures when working near the hotplate and ensure proper ventilation is maintained as per British safety standards.

### Electrical Connections and Safety Regulations

When connecting to the electricity supply, ensure the appliance is earthed and complies with local electrical regulations. Follow guidelines regarding electrical ratings and avoid using incompatible equipment that may lead to malfunctions or hazards.

### Service and Support Information

### Technical Specifications

Refer to the technical data section for specifics, including dimensions, connection requirements, and heat settings for the hotplate and ovens. Ensure that any installation adheres to the I.E.E. regulations and British standards for safety compliance. Proper ventilation is essential for appliances connected to combustion products.

**LOCATION OF THE APPLIANCE**  
Position the appliance away from the bathroom or shower area, ensuring it is installed according to the specified height requirements below the top of the hotplate. The hotplate should be positioned within a specific distance from surrounding surfaces. The installation must ensure that LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is not below ground level or on a boat.

**INSTALLATION PARTS REQUIRED**  
Ensure the hotplate is level. Adjust the height by rotating the leveling feet clockwise or counterclockwise. Fit any necessary stability brackets as per the supplied instructions. Properly secure the back and front of the unit to the shelves as illustrated in the diagrams.

**CONNECTING TO GAS**  
This should only be done with the specified components, ensuring that all connections are secure. Utilize liquid sealants only when attaching the inlet gas pipe to the shut-off valve; do not use PTFE tape. Ensure the gas supply hose is appropriately secured.

**IMPORTANT:** Use flexible tubing that complies with current BS standards for LPG connections, featuring a red label for identification.

**CONNECTING TO ELECTRICITY SUPPLY**  
Warning: Earth this appliance properly. Do not connect the grounding to gas piping. Supply voltage should be 230V-240V AC. If the molded plug is cut for any reason, it must be safely disposed of to avoid electric shock risks. If using a different connection, it must be securely integrated into the circuit board.

**WIRING INSTRUCTIONS:**  
The wire connections should be as follows: BROWN to L (Live), BLUE to N (Neutral), GREEN/YELLOW to E (Earth). Use a fused plug rated correctly.

**PRESSURE TESTING:**  
Conduct pressure tests as specified, checking for leaks along the gas supply and ensuring proper function of the flame supervision device (FSD). 

**CHECKING APPLIANCE FUNCTIONS:**
- **Grill Function:** Check that the grill ignites and operates correctly. 
- **Hotplate Function:** Ensure the crowns are seated correctly and functioning. 
- **Lid Shut-off Device:** Confirm the hotplate supply engages and disengages as intended. 
- **Main and Second Oven Thermostats:** Test for proper functioning by igniting and verifying thermoregulation as indicated.
