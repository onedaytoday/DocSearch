**Paraphrased Text:**

The selection of PM Black depends on whether traditional powders or liquids are chosen. Clothes should be treated with traditional powders or directly with traditional liquids. For compact powders and liquids, follow the specific instructions on both the top and back of the packaging. When using a washer, adhere to the guidelines and utilize fabric conditioners to reduce wrinkles and enhance care. The types of settings include machine dryers and washer options. Always follow directions regarding the MAX Bounce sheets.

To activate PM Black, choose the appropriate setting. Lights will indicate selected phases; for example, the spin speed or no-spin options. When selecting stain removal or prewash cycles, the indicator lights will show the chosen functions. The delay start feature will display a countdown once the start/pause button is engaged. 

To start, press the start/pause button; the corresponding indicator light will illuminate. If the rinse hold option is selected, the light regarding that feature will be displayed. If the machine enters a fault mode, proper troubleshooting steps must be followed. 

For detailed cleaning and maintenance, regularly clean the top recess and remove lint and threads. If the hose requires cleaning or is clogged, detach it carefully, clean it, and then reattach. Delays may occur for certain cycles based on the water temperature and duration, particularly with heavily treated fabrics.

For optimal washing results, ensure the right temperature and detergent type is used and follow recommended guidelines for cycle selection. If issues persist, AEG Service Force is available for support. Customers may consult their service information for assistance regarding warranties, repairs, and troubleshooting. 

Should the machine be relocated to a different country, certain specifications must be met in accordance with local regulations. For more information on products and services, customers can visit the AEG website or contact customer service in Slough.

**PM Black Instructions**

These instructions are crucial for the proper handling of the PM Black unit. It is essential to follow all safety protocols and internal regulations associated with this appliance. If there are any issues, consult the Service Force team.

**Unpacking and Setup**
Begin by removing the PM Black unit from its packaging. Ensure the hoses are correctly placed towards the back area. To secure the device, attach the screws firmly to hold everything in place. Adjust the screws until they are properly tightened.

Position the unit upright and remove the three spacers as per the given instructions. Ensure that no obstructions are present around the unit, as they can interfere with the coating application. Avoid placing or using the device in temperatures below 0Â°C. Ensure that hoses are connected correctly to prevent breakdowns.

**Water Supply Connection**
The hose meant for water supply must be installed with the required fittings. Ensure compliance with local regulations during this setup. Confirm the hose is undamaged and securely connects to both the appliance and the water source to prevent leaks.

**Warnings**
This appliance requires proper earthing. If you disconnect the unit, ensure the earth connection is secure. The power supply wires should be connected as follows: Earth (yellow) to the designated terminal, Neutral (blue) to the correct terminal, and Live (red) to its corresponding terminal.

**Building-In Procedures**
When preparing to integrate the unit into cabinetry, reference the assembly diagram provided. Ensure all screws used for mounting conform to the specified thickness for stability. If adjustments are necessary to accommodate height, invert specific plates as needed.

For successful integration, allow for a slight gap at the top of the unit and secure it with four countersunk screws. This will ensure a secure fit and provide proper clearance.
