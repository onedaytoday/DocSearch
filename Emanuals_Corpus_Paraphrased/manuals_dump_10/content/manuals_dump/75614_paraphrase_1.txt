The water and air filters are located at the top of the appliance. Regular replacement is advised – typically every six months – to maintain food freshness and ensure efficiency. Please consult the appropriate sections for further details. 

**Ordering Replacement Filters**

Replacement filters can be ordered from the original retailer or customer service. Specific model numbers should be referenced for accurate replacements. 

**Efficiency Tips for Storing Food**

To maximize efficiency, avoid overcrowding shelves, which can impede cooling. Store meat securely, and ensure that food is tightly sealed to prevent freezer burn. 

**Understanding Operational Sounds**

Certain sounds are normal during operation and indicate that the appliance is functioning properly. High-pitched noises may occur from the compressor as it cycles on and off. 

**Protecting Your Investment**

Regular cleaning is essential to maintaining the unit’s appearance and functionality. Follow the recommended cleaning practices to avoid damage and ensure longevity.

### Cleaning and Maintenance Tips

#### General Cleaning Precautions
- Use a soft cloth to clean the surfaces and tracks. Avoid scrubbing to prevent scratching. For any heavy-duty cleanings, utilize appropriate cleaners specific for household surfaces. 

#### Tips for Short Vacations
- Before leaving for short trips, dispose of perishable items. Turn off the cooling system using the On/Off switch and unplug the appliance. Thoroughly clean the interior to prevent odor and bacteria build-up.

#### Replacing Light Bulbs 
- Ensure the power is off before replacing bulbs in both fresh food and freezer compartments. Use protective gear when necessary. Unscrew the light cover and replace it according to the bulb specifications.

### Refrigerator Warranty Information
- This warranty lasts one year from the date of purchase. Customers are responsible for any service issues. Authorized servicers will address the warranty obligations, but customers bear costs for damages incurred from misuse or service by unauthorized personnel. 

#### Common Issues Before Calling for Service
- If cooling is ineffective, check that the appliance is plugged in, ensure no blown fuses, and check for any operational issues related to the outlet or household circuit. 

#### Adjusting Temperature Concerns
- If the food is too cold, consider adjusting the temperature settings and allowing the appliance time to stabilize. Conversely, if food is too warm, check the power supply and ensure proper sealing of doors.
