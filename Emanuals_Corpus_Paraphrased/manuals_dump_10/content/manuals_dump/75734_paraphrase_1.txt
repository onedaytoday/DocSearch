Please refer to these instructions carefully to ensure optimal operation and efficiency of the appliance. This guide includes essential information for users regarding the Children’s Safety and the cleaning protocols, including how to deactivate the COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC functions. Proper positioning of food shelves and their arrangement is crucial for effective storage. Along with corrective hints, these instructions facilitate proper usage of high-quality products while also ensuring safe practices around children and individuals with reduced physical capabilities or knowledge.

**Caution!** To prevent suffocation or injury, ensure that children are kept away from the appliance and that safety features like latches are engaged. Contact authorized service professionals for repairs or maintenance, adhering to appropriate waste disposal guidelines for the unit’s components.

To operate the appliance, toggle the ON/OFF switch for COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC functions. When activated, a light will flash, indicating that the desired temperature is being achieved. A series of acoustic signals will confirm the operational status.

When initiating the COOLMATIC function (set at +2°C), it cools the appliance efficiently while preventing ice build-up. The FROSTMATIC function safeguards fresh foods and accelerates freezing processes. 

**Operational Notes:** 

1. The first cleaning of the appliance should occur post-delivery and prior to first use, allowing it to rest for at least four hours to stabilize temperature.
2. Always ensure that no items obstruct vents to prevent overheating.
3. Regular cleaning, both internally and externally, is necessary for peak performance. Use non-corrosive cleaning agents to maintain the integrity of the appliance's surfaces.
4. Schedule regular defrosting to avoid frost accumulation and ensure efficient operation.

User-level troubleshooting such as recognizing abnormal sounds or performance issues should be reported to an authorized technician. 

Lastly, for optimal food storage, ensure that all items are appropriately covered and placed according to the provided guidelines to minimize spoilage and maintain food safety.

### Troubleshooting and Installation Guide

#### Common Issues

1. **Excess Frost Build-up**: 
   - Ensure the FROSTMATIC and COOLMATIC functions are not activated excessively.
   - Check that the water drainage system is functioning properly; water should flow freely without obstruction.
   - If frost appears, it may be due to incorrect closure of the door or items being packed too closely together.
   - Inspect for a clogged outlet; clean as necessary.

2. **Temperature Settings**:
   - Confirm that temperature settings are appropriate and not set higher than necessary. Adjust settings if needed.

3. **Correct Positioning**:
   - Maintain adequate spacing between products to ensure proper air circulation.
   - Avoid placing the appliance near heat sources (e.g., boilers, direct sunlight). The ideal ambient temperature range varies by model:
     - SN: +10°C to +32°C
     - ST: +16°C to +38°C
     - T: +16°C to +43°C

4. **Electrical Safety**:
   - Ensure proper grounding of the unit. Follow color coding for wire connections:
     - Yellow/Green: Earth
     - Brown: Live (L)
     - Blue: Neutral (N)
   - Turn off the power supply during maintenance to prevent electrical shock risks.

5. **Shelf Adjustments**:
   - To adjust shelves, follow the directional arrows on the shelf for correct positioning.
   - Make sure to secure screws properly after adjustments.

6. **Reversibility**:
   - When changing the door orientation, follow specific steps to avoid damage. Ensure all screws are tightened after adjustment.

#### Recycling and Disposal

- Properly recycle your appliance in accordance with local regulations to minimize health hazards. For information on recycling, contact your local service provider or the place of purchase.
