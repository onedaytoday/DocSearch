In convection cooking, food is heated as a result of hot air circulated by a fan, allowing even cooking throughout. This method can accommodate multiple shelves, enabling up to three layers of food to be cooked simultaneously. To achieve optimal results, it’s essential to position meat and other dishes appropriately, adjusting the shelf height based on the thickness of the food. For instance, thicker cuts of meat should be placed lower to avoid burning, while thinner items can be placed higher. The cooking temperatures for meats typically range from 200-250°C, with lower temperatures of 150-175°C suitable for other dishes.
