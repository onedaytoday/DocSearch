The refrigeration unit features coolers maintained at temperatures ranging from -2 to +8°C, with integrated thickness and construction elements. These three coolers come with pre-charged cooling systems and construction designed for optimal performance, utilizing high-quality, pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free from CFC and HCFC. The interior has rounded corners to enhance safety and cleanliness. The fast-fit design enables easy installation of airtight PVC components for both high and low-temperature applications (up to +43°C), compatible with refrigerants such as R404A.

For efficient operation, the unit incorporates a defrosting mechanism with heated elements to minimize defrosting time, complemented by internal lighting rated IP54. The assembly includes an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat, and features a right-hinged door with smooth, rounded edges that improve insulation while ensuring an airtight seal. This design adheres to HACCP standards and includes shelving as an accessory.
