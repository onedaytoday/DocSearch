GN continues the tradition of steam cooking by focusing on innovative and professional solutions tailored for caterers. The GN range includes high-quality cook & chill systems, which enhance operational efficiency. Featuring advanced operating modes, the convection steamers can prepare meat without overcooking or gratin effects. The half-power function allows for precise steam cooking, improving the organoleptic properties of food while minimizing cooking times and heat exposure.

The system optimizes the cooking process by adapting parameters for various items, including cakes, and intelligently selecting the best settings for different cuts of meat, maintaining optimal humidity levels throughout cooking phases. Additionally, a break phase allows for controlled cooking adjustments, and the built-in Air-o-clean feature simplifies maintenance.

The equipment records cooking data in compliance with HACCP standards, enabling either direct monitoring or integration with a Personal Computer for enhanced oversight.
