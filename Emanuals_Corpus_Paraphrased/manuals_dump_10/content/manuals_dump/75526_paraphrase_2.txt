### GRILL USAGE GUIDELINES

**Caution for Young Users:** Ensure young individuals are aware of the grill sounds when starting it. The grill activates automatically at its highest setting for a specific duration, releasing odor as it heats up. Ensure the grill is turned off when not in use, especially when closed.

**Important Features:** The grill operates with a cooling system. The grill pan and handle must be securely positioned, allowing for appropriate access. Ensure the food is placed centrally beneath the broiler for optimal results. 

**Tips for Cooking:** Allow food to adjust to room temperature for even cooking. Depending on the thickness, adjust cooking time accordingly. Preheat the grill to a high temperature and ensure food is turned as needed for even browning.

### SPECIFIC GRILLING CHART
**Food Cooking Times:** Adjust cooking times based on food thickness:
- Bacon Rashers
- Chops
- Whole Fish (Trout/Mackerel)
- Toast, etc.

### TOP OVEN FUNCTIONALITY

**Usage Instructions:** The top oven ensures consistent cooking. Place food evenly on the shelf, with the ability to rotate dishes to achieve uniform results. Always preheat before cooking, especially for bread.

### MAIN OVEN HEAT DISTRIBUTION

**Heat Zones:** The main oven features distinct heat zones, with the top being slightly hotter and the bottom cooler. Adjust cooking position based on item type and desired doneness. Preheat when necessary before introducing food. 

### COOKING CHART

**Recommended Positions and Timing:** Follow guidelines for shelf placements and monitor cooking times, particularly for roasting, to avoid undercooking or overcooking.

### SLOW COOKING TECHNIQUES

Slow cooking is ideal for tougher cuts of meat and can enhance flavors while reducing energy costs. Ensure appropriate internal temperatures are reached for safety. Always cover dishes tightly to retain moisture.
