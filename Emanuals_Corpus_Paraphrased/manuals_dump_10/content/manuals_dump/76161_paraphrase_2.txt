For users of the AEG-ELECTROLUX EFC60001X, this guide contains essential information, specifications, and installation instructions. 

To begin installation, secure the screws labeled X1 and X2 through the indicated areas C, J1, and J2, as illustrated. Depending on your setup, you have the option to install a ducted outlet or, if preferred, use a reducer to adapt the exhaust. If using activated charcoal filters, ensure you replace them regularly for optimal performance.

**Important Safety Warning:** To prevent fire hazards, routinely clean grease buildup and check the charcoal filters, if applicable. Ensure you connect the unit to a properly rated electrical supply with an insulated earth connection.

**Chimney Assembly:** For installation, adjust the chimney height by securing screws X1 and X2 to the provided points A and B. Apply backward force at the rear to achieve the desired height as shown.

**Usage Instructions:** Controls for lighting and fan speed are located at the front of the unit. Use the slider switches to turn the lighting ON/OFF and to set the fan to one of the four speed settings. Utilize higher settings (3/High) when cooking with strong odors.

**Maintenance Notes:** Regular cleaning of the grease filters is crucial. They should be cleaned every few months, with some being dishwasher-safe. Replace charcoal filters as needed, usually every 6 months or as required by usage.

For cleaning, a cloth with a household cleaner is recommended. Always ensure the unit is powered off before maintenance.
