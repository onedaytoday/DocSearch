**INSTALLATION OF THE WINE COOLER**

For both free-standing and built-in installations, ensure that the front of the unit is unobstructed. **SITE PREPARATION** is essential to accommodate the weight of the cooler when fully loaded. It should be connected to a grounded 15A household outlet (GFI). Compliance with local electrical codes and ordinances is required to prevent electrocution hazards. Ensure proper grounding using a three-prong outlet; avoid using adapters with two-prong connections.

**DOOR SWING AND CLEARANCE**

Ensure appropriate clearance for air intake and exhaust. Refer to UL124A guidelines for the recommended spacing. Allow sufficient clearance around the front for optimal airflow and maintain a clean surface.

**WINE RACKS WITH WOOD TRIM**

The cooler's wine racks come with a factory-applied clear finish that enhances durability. To preserve the appearance, avoid applying additional stains or finishes after the final coat. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to prepare surfaces prior to finishing, allowing adequate drying time.

**RACK INSTALLATION/REMOVAL**

To remove or install racks, use the provided screws. Clean the molding with a lint-free cloth using 3M Tri-M-Ite. Apply a thin layer of compatible protective finish, following all manufacturer recommendations for maintenance.

**LEVELING THE UNIT**

Adjust the leveling feet at the unit's base by turning them clockwise or counterclockwise to achieve stability. 

**REVERSING THE DOOR**

You can easily reverse the door swing by removing the top and bottom screws with the appropriate wrench. Relocate the top and bottom hinges as necessary to the opposite side, following the instructional diagrams available.

For additional technical details, always refer to the relevant sections within the provided manual.
