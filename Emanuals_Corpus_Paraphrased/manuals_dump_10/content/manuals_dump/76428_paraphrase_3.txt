When using cloth items, consider treating stains with appropriate cleaning agents. Use bleach only on whites and fast colors, applying it lightly. For makeup stains like lipstick, treat them similarly. When washing, first select the proper temperature settings based on the type of fabric (preferably 60°C for whites). 

For optimal results, consider prewash options for certain colors and fabrics, and use additives for additional cleaning efficiency. Follow manufacturer instructions regarding the amounts and types of detergents to use. 

For washing different items such as white and colored sheets, tablecloths, and shirts, various temperature settings can be applied ranging from 30°C to 95°C, depending on the fabric type. Ensure that items are sorted correctly to avoid damage.

In cleaning appliances, regularly check and clean filters to maintain operational efficiency. Be cautious to avoid overloading, which could impede performance. If error codes such as E10, E20, or E40 appear, refer to the manual for troubleshooting steps.

In emergency scenarios, follow proper procedures for draining the appliance. Ensure hoses are properly secured and free from kinks or blockages. If issues persist, contacting service support may be necessary.

Maintain the integrity of your setup by following all instructions related to water supply and hose positioning. Lengths and connections must comply with local regulations to ensure safe operation.
