Sure, here's the paraphrased version with a technical tone while maintaining the original meaning:

To format the SD card, use the wireless or front controls and press the [MENU] button to access the On-Screen Display (OSD). Select the format option, then confirm by pressing [YES] with the [ENTER] button. To cancel, press [NO]. For USB operation with a connected PC, ensure the PC is running Microsoft 2000 (SP4 or later). Connect the device via USB, and this connection allows image transfer from the device to the PC.

The software "ELMO TWAIN DS" assists in managing image files such as JPEGs, stored in directories like DCIM 100_ELMO for easy access. Make sure the USB connection is stable (preferably USB 2.0) to avoid operation issues.

For shooting, pressing [IMAGE ROTATION] allows you to adjust the orientation of images using the On-Screen Display. The lighting system can be toggled on/off via the front or wireless controls, providing illumination based on the brightness available. Adjust the camera head for optimal light exposure.

White balance settings are accessed through the front controls, giving options for Auto or One-Push tracking. Press [WB] to either lock the white balance or revert to defaults based on environmental light conditions.

Switching between input types (like RGB IN) or output terminals (DVI OUT, VIDEO OUT) is managed through the OSD. When switching inputs, ensure the SD card is in the ON position for proper functionality.

The autofocus feature activates with one press on the [AF] button; it locks focus once achieved. For adjusted focus, use the [FOCUS NEAR] or [FOCUS FAR] options.

Iris adjustments are made using [IRIS OPEN] or [IRIS CLOSE] to modify brightness levels, which are displayed on the OSD.

Settings, such as Iris and white balance, can be saved and recalled through memory options on the control interface. Optional LCD mounting requires additional accessories for integration with the system.

For RS-232C communication, connect the PC using the appropriate cable (DSUB-9P). Ensure the device is powered on for information transfer. The commands follow a specific format and acknowledge successful transmission or errors accordingly.
