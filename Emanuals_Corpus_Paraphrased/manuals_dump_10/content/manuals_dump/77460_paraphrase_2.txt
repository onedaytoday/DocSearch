Here's a paraphrased version of the provided text:

The track will play from memory when you press the PROGRAM button followed by PLAY/PAUSE. If you want to stop playback from memory, press the STOP button. This function can be switched to TUNER or turned off as needed. You can play tracks continuously by using the REPEAT function. When REPEAT is activated, the indicator lights up, and the tracks will loop indefinitely. To stop playback, press both PROGRAM and REPEAT. 

For RANDOM playback, press the RANDOM button on the front panel to shuffle the tracks being played. 

To listen privately, connect headphone jacks to the PHONES output. While using headphones, adjust the volume to a comfortable level; this reduces the volume for external speakers. When headphones are connected, the external speakers are automatically disconnected.

To clean the disc, always handle it by the edges and avoid touching the surface. Wipe it gently with a lint-free cloth. If needed, use a specialized CD cleaner.

If the cabinet becomes dirty, clean it with a soft cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners.
