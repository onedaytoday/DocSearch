### Operating Instructions

**Switches and Functionality**  
The switches on the right indicate their respective functions. When cooking is complete, both the indicator light and warning sound will activate, prompting you to turn off the switch. Pressing the corresponding button will illuminate both lights.

**Shelf Usage and Ventitherm Function**  
The Ventitherm shelf should be arranged from top to bottom, ensuring that heat is evenly distributed. Place the cooking sheets with the correct orientation towards the front, particularly when baking items like cakes. Preheating is essential; adjust the shelf height depending on the item being cooked, and only increase cooking times when necessary. 

**Dough Preparation**  
For yeast dough, allow for adequate rising time before proceeding with additional processing. Preheat to the specified temperature before introducing the dough to avoid undercooking. Utilize a flour-dusted surface for shaping.

**Refined Baking Techniques**  
Ensure even cooking for items like cakes or pastries. Use the appropriate preheat settings from either the Ventitherm or Rotitherm functions, as specified for your recipe.

**Roasting Guidelines**  
Utilize the Ventitherm or Rotitherm functions for roasting meats. If using the heat-resistant roasting method, ensure proper placement to avoid mess. Monitor the weight and type of meat to gauge cooking times accurately.

**Meat Preparation Notes**  
The cooking temperature should be tailored to the specifics of the meat, utilizing a thermometer when necessary to avoid undercooking. 

**Defrosting Procedures**  
For defrosting, use the Ventitherm function and monitor the process closely, turning food halfway through. Foods like meat and cream should be defrosted uncovered.

**Preservation Methodology**  
When preserving, ensure jars are properly sealed and appropriately filled to allow for even processing.

**Cleaning Protocol**  
Regularly clean the appliance, using a soft cloth and appropriate cleaners, ensuring that protective manuals are followed for any electrical components. 

**Lighting Safety**  
Always switch off the power supply before cleaning the lights, adhering to safety precautions to prevent electrical shock.
