**ELSA ECOMO Overview**

The ELSA ECOMO is designed to connect to a factory Press, where operations take place in designated timeframes based on input selection. Activating the RESET function is necessary to initiate the system.

You should already be familiar with various settings and configurations, which are designed for EU compliance (EEC), including monitoring systems. Adjustments can be made regarding brightness and refresh rates, especially in environments exposed to natural light. Utilizing anti-reflective coatings can help minimize glare and reflections. It’s crucial to position the ELSA ECOMO screen correctly to optimize viewing angles, typically around eye level, with seating arrangements ensuring a straight back for optimal posture.

To maintain the ELSA ECOMO, follow specific cleaning procedures using appropriate cloths and avoid using harsh chemicals, which might damage the surface.

**Technical Specifications**

The ELSA ECOMO CRT features deflection phosphors (Red, P22), an anti-reflective coating, and supports various synchronization interfaces, including 15HD with a warm-up period to achieve optimal performance (between 9300K and 5000K). It requires a power supply of AC 220-240 V and operates under specified humidity conditions. The unit is designed to comply with CE and UL safety standards, along with FCC classifications.

**Factory Information**

The factory settings may include specific parameters for VGA assignments and signal synchronization. Users can quickly access these configurations through the control interface. If issues arise, the system displays relevant messages, such as "NO SIGNAL" or "FREQUENCY OUT OF RANGE," which can often be resolved through automatic adjustments.

**Troubleshooting**

If the LED indicator is on, check the connection status of the AC power. The presence of "ATTENTION NO SIGNAL" suggests a disconnection issue. Pressing designated reset buttons can automatically recalibrate the display parameters. Additionally, ensure that restraining wires are functioning correctly to prevent interference with the CRT operation.

**TCO Compliance**

Congratulations on selecting a TCO-certified product, contributing to sustainability by reducing environmental impacts associated with electronic devices. TCO certification emphasizes the responsible management of harmful substances while ensuring safety standards for electronic products.
