**AG-61+62D-UK English MCD1751E MCD1761E Microwave Operating Instructions**

**INTRODUCTION**

Thank you for choosing the AEG microwave. Please read the instruction manual carefully to familiarize yourself with its features and ensure safe and efficient operation. For any operational issues or inquiries, refer to the relevant sections in this guide.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**

To prevent fire hazards, ensure the microwave operates within specified limits. Overheating food can lead to dangerous situations. Avoid opening the door during operation, and if food catches fire, turn off the microwave immediately. Use only microwave-safe containers and regularly clean the chamber, door cover, and exterior to avoid grease build-up, which can be flammable.

**USER GUIDELINES**

When using the microwave, particularly for popcorn or other specific food types, adhere to the guidelines provided. The appliance should not be tampered with or serviced by unauthorized personnel. Individuals with pacemakers should consult a healthcare professional regarding microwave usage.

**WARNING REGARDING FOOD PREPARATION**

Always properly cover foods to prevent splattering and escapes of steam, which can cause burns. Foods with sealed shells or those that can explode (like eggs) should be punctured or opened before microwaving. Be cautious when reheating high-water-content foods, as they can cause burns or scalding if not monitored.

**CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS**

Keep the turntable and microwave cavity free from debris and ensure all components are in good condition. If malfunction occurs, contact the authorized service technician.

**GENERAL MICROWAVE OPERATION**

The microwave heats food using microwaves that create friction, essentially heating the interior of the food. It is crucial to avoid materials that cannot withstand heat, which could lead to sparks. Use only approved packaging to ensure safe cooking.

**COOKING FUNCTIONS**

The microwave can combine different cooking modes, such as grilling and roasting. This flexibility enhances your cooking by allowing for various preparation methods within recommended guidelines, helping to reduce cooking time and improve results.

Monitor internal temperatures with a food thermometer for best results and ensure thorough cooking. This applies particularly to proteins and sensitive dishes. 

Keep these instructions for future reference and consult them as needed to guarantee optimal performance of your AEG microwave.

AG-61+62D-UK English Blanching requires that foods be blanched before further cooking. This involves heating them briefly, then rapidly cooling them to halt the cooking process, and storing them in airtight containers. Microwave blanching is an efficient option. Refer to the specific microwave instructions for the proper amount of food to thaw, heat, or cook. A good rule of thumb is: for double the amount of food, nearly double the time; for half the amount, half the time. Cooking capacity and method should be considered to prevent overcooking. Round foods cook more evenly in a microwave than those with corners, which can lead to uneven cooking. Covering food during heating shortens cooking time. Thicker or denser items should also be covered to ensure even cooking. Furthermore, turning items during cooking, such as roasts, can help achieve better results.

For heating ready-prepared foods, ensure they are covered with a microwave-safe lid or plate. This is especially important for items like coffee, which should be heated in suitable containers to prevent uneven heating. Defrosting typically takes less time than cooking food. Use appropriate microwave-safe plates that can handle temperatures up to C°. It is important to cover thin items while defrosting to prevent overcooking, while thicker items need to be adequately positioned for uniform heating. Adjust cooking times accordingly based on food thickness to ensure even defrosting.

Fresh foods, when cooked from frozen, should be seasoned as usual. Ensure that meats are thoroughly cooked and monitored carefully during the process. Cooking times for microwave-heated foods can vary based on the food type; thicker cuts generally require longer periods than thinner ones.

Refer to the microwave's user guide for cooking or reheating guidelines, whether for soups, meats, or baked goods. When using the microwave, set the TIMER/WEIGHT/POWER controls appropriately and select the suitable COOKING MODE for your needs. 

For grill cooking, use the appropriate settings to achieve desired browning. With grill and microwave settings, adjust accordingly to avoid burning. 

The multi-sequence cooking feature allows for combinations of microwaving and grilling. Ensure to set the parameters correctly with the TIMER/WEIGHT/POWER dial. 

The Quick Start Function provides a one-touch option for immediate microwave cooking. To check the power level, interact with the COOKING MODE buttons, keeping in mind that safety features like the Safety Lock Function can be activated to prevent unwanted operations.

The AUTOMATIC function simplifies cooking and defrosting. Follow the displayed guidelines on the microwave's interface to select the appropriate program and input the food's weight for optimal cooking results. If needed, manual adjustments can also be made for precision cooking.
