**Electrical Supply and Maintenance Instructions**

To ensure optimal operation of the appliance, it is crucial to keep it empty and clean, especially when the electricity supply is interrupted. If the unit is inadvertently closed, it can affect the cooling process and lead to mold growth.

To manage the temperature, use the (WARMER) or (COLDER) buttons accordingly. The display will indicate the current temperature and target settings, which should be verified for accuracy. If the appliance is shut down, switch it back to operation using the (COLDER) button as required.

In case of any malfunction concerning food preservation, it’s important to contact Service Force for assistance. Continuous operation may be affected by improper water flow or issues with sound levels during cooling, which could indicate a malfunctioning thermostat.

Proper installation is critical. The coupling should be attached correctly with the appropriate thread, and hoses must not be cracked or improperly connected. Refer to the technical specifications (Model 92358-KA2) for ratings concerning operation environments.

For unpacking, ensure all packaging materials are removed, and avoid allowing children to play with any components to prevent choking hazards. Cleaning should be performed with a soft cloth, and screws must be securely attached to prevent malfunctions.

Additional safety precautions include ensuring that the appliance is grounded and avoiding exposure to extreme temperatures or moisture. The device should be positioned to allow for adequate airflow around it, maintaining an environment conducive to efficient operation.

If issues arise, consult the troubleshooting section or reach out to authorized service personnel for further guidance.
