### Summary
Please keep these instructions handy for reference and adhere to safety guidelines to ensure safe operation and maintenance of your appliance.

**ESEC Lights and Cooking Guidance**

The ESEC system features lights that indicate when the surface is hot. The hot light will illuminate when the cooking zones are active and will turn off only once they have cooled to a safe temperature. If any light is flashing, it signifies that further action is needed to ensure safe operation. 

**Cookware Compatibility and Heating Adjustments**

Use the specified cookware that properly fits on the heating elements. To adjust heat, turn the knobs counterclockwise or clockwise, increasing to higher settings as required. Once cooking is finished, the lights will indicate that the surface is cooling down, even if they remain lit momentarily.

**Bridge Element Usage**

The Bridge feature enables two elements to heat cookware together effectively. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for the correct cookware to use with this component. Adjust as necessary to achieve the appropriate cooking temperature. 

**Care and Cleaning Procedures**

Regular maintenance is crucial. Immediately address spills or heavy soil to minimize extensive cleaning later. Avoid using abrasive materials that can scratch surfaces. For tough residue, consider specialized cleaners while ensuring surfaces are cool beforehand.

**Safety Precautions**

Ensure proper fire safety measures are adhered to, particularly around the oven and while broiling. If a fire occurs, do not attempt to extinguish it with water and have a fire extinguisher accessible.

**Food Preparation and Cooking Tips**

Preheat as per the guidelines to ensure even cooking. Avoid overcrowding, as this can result in uneven heating and longer cooking times. Measure heating adjustments accurately to optimize results.

**Final Remarks**

Regular cleaning and adherence to safety protocols not only enhance the lifespan of your appliance but also contribute significantly to safe and efficient cooking practices. Always consult the specific user manual for further insights and operational instructions.

**Cleaning Instructions for Surfaces and Components**

**General Cleaning**  
Before cleaning, ensure surfaces have cooled. Utilize a soft cloth or a damp cloth with a suitable amount of cleaner for maintenance. Avoid harsh scrubbing and aggressive cleaning products. Attention must be given to avoid permanently damaging surfaces that may have become discolored or aged over time.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**  
Deactivate the self-cleaning feature and allow the appliance to cool before proceeding with manual cleaning. Ensure the cooking racks and associated components are cleaned thoroughly. Use gentle cleaning agents to avoid scratches or chemical damage, and always follow the manufacturerâ€™s cleaning guidelines.

**Using Cleaning Products**  
Only utilize approved cleaning products. For effective results, apply the CERAMA BRYTE cleaning solution directly to the affected areas, ensuring that the unit is turned off and cooled. Avoid utilizing abrasive cleaners or those that may leave residues that can lead to further damage.

**Safety Precautions**  
Always maintain safety standards by wearing appropriate protective gear, and keep children away from appliances during cleaning. Be cautious to not touch components that may have residual heat.

**Warmers and Additional Components**  
Turn off the warmer before cleaning. Use a non-abrasive cloth to wipe surfaces and avoid using aggressive cleaning methods. If necessary, cover areas to prevent overheating during cleaning.

These guidelines represent essential steps for maintaining the appearance and functionality of your appliance while ensuring safety and longevity. For thorough cleaning instructions, refer to the specific cleaning section provided in the user manual.
