### OWNER'S GUIDE

**IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS**

To minimize the risks of fire, electric shock, or injury, adhere to the following guidelines: 

1. Always turn off the device and unplug it before servicing or performing maintenance.
2. Avoid using the vacuum as a toy or allowing children to play with it.
3. Use only recommended attachments.
4. Do not operate the vacuum with a damaged cord or plug, or near heated surfaces.
5. Ensure the cord does not come into contact with sharp edges or corners.
6. For safety, keep the cord away from heat sources and ensure it is protected from wear.
7. Avoid using the device in areas with flammable substances, such as matches or ashes.
8. Allow the vacuum to cool down before cleaning or servicing.

**SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOUSEHOLD USE ONLY**

Be aware that improper use may result in electric shock. Ensure you are using the correct outlet for your device. The thermal thermostat helps prevent overheating. If the vacuum shuts off, turn the on/off switch to the "off" (O) position and unplug it. Always contact an Authorized Service Center for repairs or concerns.
