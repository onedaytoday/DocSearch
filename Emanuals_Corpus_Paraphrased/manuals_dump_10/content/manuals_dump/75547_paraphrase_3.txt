Always monitor the cooking process to prevent overcooking or burning. In case of a fire, keep a fire extinguisher handy, and do not throw water on grease fires. Follow all operation guidelines closely for best results in your cooking endeavors.

Here’s a paraphrased version of your text:

Cooking is complete when the food reaches the designated internal temperature, which should be between 150°F and 190°F, ideally around 170°F. To keep food safe and warm, it's important to cover it and avoid leaving it at temperatures below 140°F for extended periods. The cooking process can be enhanced by utilizing the warmer functionality; simply select "KEEP WARM" and press "START." To stop a cooking cycle, select "CANCEL" for OVEN or WARMER.

For slow cooking, options like a Crock-Pot can be used. When roasting poultry, ensure it doesn't burn by adjusting to high (HI) or low (LO) settings, and monitor the cooking time. Defrosting should be approached carefully, as improper thawing can lead to unsafe cooking conditions. Use a food thermometer to check temperatures, preheat when necessary, and follow proper thawing practices as outlined by USDA guidelines. 

For dough proofing—activating the yeast—set the environment to 85°F to 100°F. Shallow pans can help achieve the ideal condition. Choose "BREAD PROOF," then "START" to initiate the process; you can cancel anytime to exit the function.

For precise cooking of foods like roasts, the "PERFECT" option allows for temperature adjustments between 170°F and 550°F, generally set around 325°F for roasting. The internal temperature must reach appropriate levels to ensure safety; monitoring with a probe thermometer can assist in this.

Convection cooking options are also available for even heat distribution, providing versatile cooking methods. The "MULTI STAGE" function allows the user to set multiple cooking processes for increased efficiency. Adjust settings as needed, including the ability to turn options on or off in the preferences menu. 

User preferences can be configured for clock visibility and sound settings, ensuring that these features suit individual needs. It’s possible to reset options to factory defaults at any time. Adjust intervals and temperatures as per individual cooking requirements, and always confirm settings before starting the appliance.

- Use only recommended cleaners for painted and chrome surfaces to avoid damage.
- Clean grates and heating elements using a damp cloth; avoid abrasive materials.

### Light Shield Maintenance

Ensure the light shield is properly installed whenever the oven is in use. Clean it carefully, but never operate the oven without it in place.

### Cleaning Burners and Cooktop

Burner grates and heads should be cleaned immediately after use for best results:

1. Allow them to cool before cleaning.
2. Use a soft sponge or cloth and avoid harsh cleaners that can scratch surfaces.
3. Ensure burners are correctly seated after cleaning. 

By following these instructions, you can ensure both optimal cooking performance and longevity of your appliance.

### Cooking and Usage Guidelines

When cooking items like breads and cakes, it’s essential to preheat your oven appropriately. Always ensure you allow for proper preheating to avoid overcrowding or cooking at excessively high temperatures, as this can lead to uneven cooking or even warping.

Follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding temperature settings—avoid exceeding the recommended temperature by more than 25°F (12°C). Maintain adequate clearance around food items and avoid frequently opening the oven door twice during cooking, as this can disrupt the cooking process.

In the event of interruptions to power supply or clock operation, ensure that all connections are secure. If issues persist, contact an authorized service technician for assistance.

### Meat Cooking Tips

For optimal meat cooking, maintain the right clearance and avoid curling during searing operations. Allow grease to accumulate without covering the meat, and clean the drip areas frequently to prevent buildup. Ensure the self-cleaning feature is engaged and thoroughly followed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.

### Cookware Selection

Select flat-bottomed, smooth cookware to ensure even cooking. Using the appropriate type of cookware is crucial for achieving proper heating. Avoid using warped or excessively lightweight pans, which can hinder performance.
