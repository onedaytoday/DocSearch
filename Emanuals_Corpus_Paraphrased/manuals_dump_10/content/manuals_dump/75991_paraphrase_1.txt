**Cooking Guidelines**

Ensure food is prepared evenly and efficiently by appropriately matching the amount of food with the type of heat-conducting cookware. Select utensils that are easy to clean and align with the cooking methods described in the accompanying chart. The type and quantity of food being cooked will impact thermometer readings, so adjust accordingly. If the cooking temperature is too low, food may turn soggy and greasy. Conversely, excessively high temperatures can lead to uneven cooking.  

**Utilizing Cookware Correctly**

Opt for cookware with flat and stable bottoms, avoiding warped or curved designs. Use appropriate cooking equipment as specified for each technique. Be mindful of the cooking order and match the food quantity and type to the cooking method used. Always allow food to cool safely and employ heat-resistant materials, such as potholders, to prevent burns. 

**Using the Warmer**

The warmer should be positioned upright, enabling both warming and cooking processes. Ideally, food should be covered during warming. Clean the warmer, dishware, and cookware as per instructions. Select specific warmer settings, like KEEP WARM, and press START. Use the CANCEL option to stop warming when necessary. Maintain safety by keeping children away from the warmer while it’s hot to avoid burns.

**Preheating and Temperature Settings**

Preheat cookware from 170°F to 550°F, optimally around 350°F. If using racks, ensure they’re properly spaced apart and not crowded. Select UPPER, press BAKE, and START to commence preheating. The display will indicate when preheating is active and when the designated temperature is reached. 

**Cooking Time Management**

Monitor cooking times using the COOK TIME or END TIME features, especially for quicker-cooking items like meat. Ensure food is consumed promptly after cooking to avoid foodborne illness. The system will automatically shut off after the countdown finishes. 

**Convection Cooking**

Utilize Convection settings when applicable to enhance cooking efficiency. Adjustments may be necessary based on food types. Monitor cooking by selecting UPPER, pressing BAKE, and START to initiate the convection process.

**Roasting Procedures**

For roasting, heat settings range from 300°F to 550°F. Securely seat the food to prevent mishaps. Use racks and follow specific guidelines to ensure even cooking of items like meat and poultry. Be cautious of grease accumulation to prevent fires.

**Finishing and Keeping Food Warm**

After cooking, ensure food is held at safe temperatures between 150°F and 190°F. Allow food to cool if necessary, following the warmer guidelines to retain food quality. Utilize the KEEP WARM function to maintain serving temperature.
