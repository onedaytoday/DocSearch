### Tape Recording Instructions

**Recording:** You can record directly from a CD or through the built-in microphone. To switch to tape mode, press the "FUNCTION" button until "TAPE" is selected (make sure "RADIO" is off). Insert a tape facing the correct direction and labeled with formats such as CrO (Chrome) or C-60. Once ready, press "RECORD" to begin capturing sounds. Use the microphone for direct recording; press "PAUSE" to temporarily halt recording and "STOP/EJECT" to finalize.

**Automatic Level Control (ALC):** This feature manages recording levels to prevent distortion. Adjust settings to mitigate overload and optimize sound quality.

**Headphone Use:** A stereo headphone jack is located at the back of the device. Connecting headphones mutes the internal speaker, allowing for a more focused audio experience. 

### Care and Maintenance for Cassette Tapes

Ensure that previously recorded tapes are handled properly. To avoid accidental recording, remove the protective tab. Maintaining the tape is essential to prevent issues arising from tight wrapping around the mechanism. If this occurs, gently unwind the tape. 

**Cleaning:** Regular cleaning of the recording/playback heads is crucial to prevent performance degradation. When cleaning, switch off the device, eject the tape, and use a lint-free cloth or a dedicated head cleaner.

### CD Maintenance

To keep CDs in good condition, handle them by the edges to avoid fingerprints or smudges. Clean with a lint-free cloth, wiping straight from the center outward. Avoid using abrasive cleaners.

### Cabinet Care

Keep the cabinet clean and free from any substances that may affect its finish. Use a soft cloth for cleaning.
