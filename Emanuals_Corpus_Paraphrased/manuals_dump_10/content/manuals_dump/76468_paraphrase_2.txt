The highest operational standards apply to customers using glasswashers and various types of dishwashers. These machines are designed for environments where efficiency and cleanliness are paramount. They are particularly tailored to handle glassware and require minimal installation effort. The dishwashers can operate at temperatures of up to 60Â°C, with specific recommendations for temporary use.

User-friendly features include the integration of the BRITA PURITY Clean system, which selectively removes impurities and enhances the longevity of dishware and cutlery. Technical specifications such as width and height ensure they fit seamlessly in designated spaces. 

Maintenance is straightforward, significantly improving operational efficiency while reducing downtime. Additionally, adherence to ISO standards confirms their environmentally friendly design, as these models are CFC-free. The TOTALDEMI IOB010 model exemplifies this commitment, supporting operations without compromising environmental integrity.
