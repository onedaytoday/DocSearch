### Cleaning Instructions

To complete the cleaning process, refer to the Cleaning section for detailed instructions. To access the food compartment, pull the release mechanism located at the front. While holding the release, slightly lift both the front and back sections until fully disengaged. Ensure that the cavity walls are properly cleaned and that the parts are snapped back into place securely. Do not force them; avoid damaging the back of the cavity. 

### Preheating Functions

For preheating using convection, follow the indicated temperatures in Fahrenheit and Celsius. The factory setting for preheat is 350°F (176°C). Other temperatures include:
- 550°F (288°C)
- 170°F (76°C)
- 400°F (204°C)
- 300°F (148°C)

To set the clock, press the respective buttons after a power interruption. The clock can be adjusted to 12-hour or 24-hour format as needed. When active, the clock displays cooking or self-clean functions. 

### Cooking Instructions

To begin cooking, utilize the "COOK" option, and ensure the cooking settings align with the food recommendations. The factory preheat for cooking items like cakes and bread is set at 350°F (176°C). Activate preheating by pressing and holding the appropriate buttons. 

### Safety Warnings

Always monitor food to prevent overcooking or potential fires. In case of a fire, do not throw water on flames; instead, use a fire extinguisher. For broiling meats, follow the specified heat settings carefully to avoid safety hazards.

### General Notes

When cooking, ensure that the food is placed correctly in the oven and is accompanied by racks where necessary. This allows for even heat distribution and optimal cooking results. The cooking process can be adjusted at any time by pressing "CANCEL" to stop active functions.

The Convection mode enables cooking with specified instructions for optimal performance. To set the factory default of 350°F (176°C), press the "CONV BAKE" button and initiate heating. A tone will signal when the temperature is reached. Canceling a cooking cycle will reduce the cooking time or temperature. For cooking at 375°F (191°C), activate the corresponding settings, and a tone will indicate when cooking is done or has been canceled. 

Convection cooking is suitable for meats and poultry, as it circulates hot air, enhancing cooking efficiency. Adhere to factory settings, such as 350°F (176°C) and others listed, and make adjustments based on the type of food being prepared. Ensure food is covered appropriately to avoid over-browning and retain moisture. 

The KEEP WARM function can be activated to maintain food temperature safely above 170°F (76°C). It’s crucial to avoid food contamination, so keep food from contacting grease during cooking. Refer to the provided chart to select recommended temperatures for various food items.

To ensure successful cooking, include thawed foods when appropriate, and cover food items as necessary to ensure proper cooking. Setting the COOK TIME allows for timed cooking, which may correlate with religious observances, such as the Sabbath. Adjustments to cooking times should be made based on the food’s thermal requirements and preparation state.

In self-clean mode, ensure all items are suitable for high-heat cleaning. Follow instructions carefully to prevent burns or damage. After cleaning, let the oven cool completely before wiping down. The self-clean cycle can vary in duration, from 2 to 3 hours, depending on the cleaning requirements. Always keep safety in mind and avoid forcing the lock if it does not engage properly.

When restoring factory settings, adjustments can be made through a series of button presses. Be cautious and maintain ventilation during self-cleaning to prevent hazardous smells or damage to surrounding areas.

**Self-Cleaning Instructions**

To initiate the self-cleaning function, press the designated button. Ensure the oven is set to a high temperature for effective cleaning. Allow sufficient time for the oven to cool down before proceeding. 

If you need to start another self-clean cycle shortly after the previous one, it must cool sufficiently first. Typically, this cooling period is several hours. Should the self-clean process be interrupted, you may need to restart it to achieve proper cleanliness.

Wait for the cycle to complete before opening the oven door, as both the oven and its surfaces will be extremely hot.

**General Cleaning Guidelines**

To clean painted or decorative surfaces, use a gentle cloth instead of harsh cleaners, which may cause scratches. Avoid using cleaners that could damage the finish or heating elements.

For any built-up grease, apply appropriate cleaning solutions with care to avoid scratching. Use a damp cloth for easy surface cleaning, ensuring to clean food debris directly from the surfaces requested in the self-cleaning instructions.

**Safety Precautions**

Always allow components to cool before handling. Do not touch areas while in operation to prevent burns or electric shock. Ensure that food and other materials do not obstruct or accumulate around the appliance's heating elements.

**Appliance Maintenance and Troubleshooting**

To address common service issues, check the clock section for proper functionality and clear any error displays. If service is needed, contact customer support. For best results, ensure proper installation and clearance for efficient operation. If food builds up, regularly clean the appliance to maintain optimal function.
