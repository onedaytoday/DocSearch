Ensure that the appliance is situated in a well-ventilated area, away from sunlight and other heat sources. The rated climate class for your appliance ranges from SN to ST.

Please follow these guidelines to ensure efficient and safe operation of your appliance. For further information on installation and maintenance, refer to the relevant sections in the manual.

**Warning:** If the temperature exceeds a certain threshold, an acoustic warning tone will activate. To manage the food items or adjust the settings, turn off the warning using the "ALARM OFF" button. The warning will cease once the door is closed. A warning light will flash and a tone will sound if the temperature is higher than the designated C. Ensure food safety by maintaining proper temperature levels, as outlined in the guidelines. 

**Switching Off the Appliance:** To power down, use the ON/OFF button. A countdown will indicate when the unit is about to shut off. Disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply entirely when itâ€™s not in use. Ensure the door remains shut to prevent temperature fluctuations and potential spoilage. Regularly check the temperature of the food stored, particularly meat products, using a thermometer.

**Food Storage Recommendations:** Arrange shelves as needed to optimize space for grocery items. When storing bottles, place them front-facing to facilitate access. Use care when removing items from shelves, ensuring bottles do not obstruct others. 

**Cooling Performance:** Monitor temperatures as the shelves may vary slightly; ensure food is stored correctly for optimal cooling. Cover food items to maintain freshness and prevent odor transfer. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance:** Always disconnect from the power supply before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning agents and methods to maintain appliance performance, avoiding bleach or harsh chemicals. 

For any service needs or issues, contact the authorized service provider for assistance. Ensure proper handling of the appliance following regulations to maintain warranties and service eligibility.
