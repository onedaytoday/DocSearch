The cooking process is automated. Cooking will commence once the door is closed, and the START/+30 button is pressed. You can initiate the POWER mode with a single press. To adjust the cooking time, rotate the TIMER/WEIGHT dial either clockwise or counterclockwise. Pressing the START/+30 button will begin the cooking process. The timer can be set for increments of seconds, and the cooking time can be adjusted during operation.

You can directly select W/HIGH mode using the START/+30 button for a specific duration. This function also supports AUTO COOK and AUTO DEFROST. The PLUS and MINUS functions allow you to adjust cooking times—if food is cooking too firmly, use MINUS to decrease time, or PLUS to increase it.

For grilling, you can select GRILL or DUAL GRILL modes. To cook using these settings, adjust the TIMER/WEIGHT dial and press the START/+30 button. You can use AUTO COOK and AUTO DEFROST to efficiently cook or defrost a variety of foods. 

When using AUTO DEFROST, ensure to touch the TIMER/WEIGHT dial, and select the appropriate defrosting option based on the type of food. Follow sound indications and visual prompts during cooking.

For specific items like meat, ensure that they are evenly rearranged during defrosting for thorough results. Follow the cooking charts for various foods, including chilled items and chart-specific recommendations for meat weights or quantities.

To prep layered dishes, grease the cooking container and season as necessary. For even cooking, cover items adequately while heating or defrosting. Cooking times and temperatures may vary, so monitor closely to avoid overcooking.

When using the microwave, consider reducing the quantity for thicker mixtures or cooking processes. Use shallow containers for better heating efficiency and enhance flavors with seasonings. Finally, ensure even distribution of ingredients like meats and vegetables for optimal results.

**Recipe Instructions:**

1. Prepare a shallow dish by greasing it with butter. Sauté finely chopped garlic, onions, and crushed/minced tomatoes until tender. Mix with grated cheese and season to taste. Layer the cooked mixture in the greased dish, and then beat eggs and whisk them into the mixture. Bake until thickened and golden on top.

2. For the fruit preparation, core and chop whole pears, then cook them covered with a raspberry sauce until tender. Beat egg whites separately and incorporate them as needed for texture. Grease the baking dish and layer the ingredients, ensuring the pears are evenly distributed. Cover and bake until cooked through.

**Cleaning Instructions:**

**CAUTION:** Avoid using commercial oven cleaners, steam cleaners, abrasive scrubs, or cloths containing sodium, as these may damage the microwave's interior. Regularly clean the interior and remove any food particles, using a soft cloth. Only use gentle cleaners that won’t scratch the surface. 

To clean, wipe down the microwave with a damp cloth. Be sure to remove the turntable and clean it separately—both parts are dishwasher safe. 

**Troubleshooting Recommendations:**

If the microwave does not operate correctly, ensure that the door is securely closed and the turntable is properly positioned. If issues persist, consult a qualified Electrolux service technician. Verify that food is heated thoroughly and in accordance with specifications listed on the rating plate found inside the microwave.
