Here's a paraphrased version of your text:

To begin, turn off the heating function and adjust the settings as per the guidelines. Preheat the oven to the appropriate temperature for baking, typically between 150°C to 200°C. This initial step is vital for preparing shortcrust pastry and other dishes. The choice of cooking time and temperature depends on the type and quantity of food. If using baking trays or pans, ensure they are evenly spaced for optimal heat distribution. 

When roasting meat, a higher temperature of 200°C to 250°C is preferred, whereas white meats should be roasted at a lower range of 150°C to 175°C. Cook times should be monitored meticulously, ensuring proper activation of roasting features. To check doneness, press the center of the meat; if it's firm, it’s fully cooked.

This guidance extends to different types of dishes:
- **Cakes** should be baked at specified temperatures for optimal texture and flavor.
- **Breads and Pizzas** have their own temperature ranges for the best results.
- **Flans and Meats** require attention to ensure proper cooking temperatures and times.
- **Fish** and other seafood also necessitate careful preparation.

For cleaning purposes, the oven should be turned off and cooled before you start. Use soft cloths and non-abrasive cleaners to maintain the surfaces. Avoid strong chemicals or rough materials that may damage non-stick finishes. Regular cleaning is essential to ensure proper hygiene and functionality.

If using a self-cleaning function, make sure the oven is empty and cool. Activate the cleaning mode and follow the prompts for a thorough clean. Ensure safety precautions, especially when dealing with hot surfaces and electrical components. 

Finally, if you encounter any issues with the cooking or cleaning functions, consult the troubleshooting section or contact Customer Service for assistance.
