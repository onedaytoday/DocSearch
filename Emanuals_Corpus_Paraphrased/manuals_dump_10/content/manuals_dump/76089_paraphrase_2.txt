Here is a paraphrased version of your text:

For the ELECTROLUX Z8240, please refer to the technical information, specifications, and user instructions associated with the device. If any issues arise, such as the light turning off or the motor exceeding operational limits during rotation, ensure to disconnect the power immediately. 

When you pause cleaning, you can attach the vacuum cleaner’s hose back to the unit for storage. To shorten the hose, simply release it towards the cleaner. 

For emptying the TwinClean, press the designated release button and detach the waste container. After cleaning, ensure the container clicks back into position for secure operation. 

Monitor the filter light; it will flash when it’s time to clean the filter. Turn off the vacuum when this occurs, and remove the filter cover by releasing the catch. Clean the filter every 5 to 7 years for the standard filter and according to the guidelines for the HEPA filter, which features a denser fiber. 

Be cautious of blockages in the hose—remove any that are obstructing airflow. After addressing the blockage, restart the vacuum cleaner. 

Ensure that the filters are rinsed with lukewarm water and allowed to dry before reassembly. Always refer to the warranty coverage for any issues related to the hoses.
