### Grill Safety and Usage Guidelines

**Caution with Young Children**
When using the grill, ensure that young children are kept at a safe distance, as they should not be near the heating sounds. The grill lights automatically and releases heat after a few seconds. Always turn the grill off once it’s closed to prevent gas flow.

**Grill Pan and Handle**
Ensure the grill pan and handle are correctly positioned to allow for safe operation. The shelf should be centered beneath the grill to facilitate heat distribution. 

**Cooking Tips**
Allow food to come to temperature before cooking to promote even browning. Avoid splashing by cooking food thoroughly, and use lighter marinades or oil for meats. Preheat the grill to the appropriate high setting before cooking.

**Grilling Chart**
Refer to the guide for proper food placement and cooking times for items such as rashers, chops, and whole trout/mackerel.

### Top Oven Usage

**Overview**
Utilize the top oven for various cooking tasks. Food should be arranged evenly for hot air circulation. Always preheat the oven before placing food inside.

**Shelf Placement**
Install the top oven shelves straight and ensure there are no obstacles at the front to allow heat circulation. Each shelf should be monitored for even cooking.

### Main Oven Operation

**Heat Zones**
Be aware of the different heat zones in the main oven. The top is slightly hotter than the bottom. Preheat as needed before placing food inside, and adjust shelf positions for optimal cooking results.
