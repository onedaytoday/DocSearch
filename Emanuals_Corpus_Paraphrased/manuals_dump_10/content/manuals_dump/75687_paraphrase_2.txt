### Chillers Overview

Chillers efficiently cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively reducing bacterial growth. The chilling process enables food preservation at +3°C, minimizing spoilage and maintaining quality. The design incorporates crosswise systems with advanced features for optimal performance.

### Operating Modes

- **Soft Chilling**: Targets +2°C
- **Chilling**: Maintains +3°C

The ARTE model employs continuous cooling based on food insertion. Operating modes are compatible with NF and UK standards and can include UV functionality as an accessory. The system allows for countdowns and service notifications, with operational data recorded, including HACCP compliance for abnormal terminations.

### Performance

Chiller performance varies based on food type and chilling specifications according to NF standards.

### Construction and Finishing

Constructed from AISI materials, with a high polyurethane insulation thickness, all components are HCFC-free. The equipment meets ISO factory regulations and features rounded corners with IP20 protection.
