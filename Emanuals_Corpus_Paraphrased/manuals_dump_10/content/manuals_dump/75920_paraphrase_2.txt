**OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS**  
*Controls*  
The control panel features buttons for "AC," "DC," "GAS (LP)," and "OFF." The light will flash to indicate operation status. Ensure the power supply corresponds to the selected mode. 

*Starting the Refrigerator*  
Follow the operational guidelines specific to each power setting (LP, AC, or DC). Ensure that the bottle is connected properly; the thermostat may need adjusting. 

*Regulating Temperature*  
The refrigerator requires several hours to achieve optimal temperature. Adjust the thermostat accordingly based on the mode of operation. 

*Travel Catch*  
Utilize travel catches to secure the food and ensure efficient cooling.

*Food Storage*  
Ensure food items are cooled before storage, especially liquids that may freeze. 

*Ice-Making*  
Temporarily adjust the cooling temperature to achieve ice formation.

*Defrosting*  
Regularly check for frost build-up and defrost as necessary. Use methods that do not damage the unit.

*Cleaning the Refrigerator*  
Use a soft cloth for cleaning the interior; avoid harsh scouring products. 

*Heating Cable*  
Utilize the heating cable during colder months to maintain temperature.

*Winter Operation*  
Utilize winter covers when temperatures drop below 10°C for better performance.

*Turning Off the Refrigerator*  
Switch the unit off and defrost before extended shutdowns.

*Troubleshooting*  
Verify that the power supply is intact and that bottles are full. If issues persist, consult a technician.

**MAINTENANCE**  
Schedule routine maintenance with certified professionals to ensure safe operation. 

**INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**  
*Repositioning Hinges*  
Refer to the instructions for adjusting door hinges and ensure a proper fit.

*Installation/Building-In*  
Position the refrigerator in a well-ventilated area to optimize cooling performance. 

*Ventilation of the Unit*  
Ensure adequate ventilation while positioning the refrigerator in the vehicle. 

*LP Gas Connection*  
Verify that the gas supply is set at the correct pressure and is securely connected.

**TECHNICAL DATA**  
Includes specifications for installation and operational requirements. Ensure proper clearance for functionality.

**CAUTION**  
Check that the gas supply to the refrigerator is at the correct pressure. Adjust as necessary per manufacturer guidelines.

This system is designed for continuous operation using bottled gas with threaded connections. **PUSH-ON CONNECTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.** This type of permanent connection should be specifically used in the United States and must be securely sealed with threaded fittings. The gas supply must be connected to a gas-tight faucet rated for bottled gas, and it should allow for easy servicing. The technician must test the installation upon completion.

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTION**: The electrical setup must comply with regulatory standards, ensuring effective grounding. The power supply should be properly earthed, and the outlet must be easily accessible. Wires should be connected according to the following color codes: 
- Green/Yellow for Earth 
- Brown for Live 
- Blue for Neutral 

**WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED.** If using a fused plug (B.S. standard), ensure it meets ASTA and B.S. specifications according to the required voltage. Ensure that wires are routed smoothly to avoid damage and that they maintain proper polarity.

For satisfactory operation, ensure that the system is rated for the specified amperage (A). Connect the appliance directly to the battery with the light enabled to facilitate charging. 

If the battery cover needs to be removed and replaced, follow appropriate procedures. 

**RM TECHNICAL DATA: RM Height Cooling Capacity**: This information pertains to food storage without LP cooling at ambient temperatures of 25°C as per ISO standards.
