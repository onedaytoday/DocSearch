**EOB Instruction and GB DEJ-K/RD-SD**

This instruction pertains to the Italian model K/CS D-35745. It includes operational guidelines, initial cleaning protocols, heating instructions, and function switch operations. The document covers application charts for roasting and cleaning, technical service instructions, and safety guidelines.

It is crucial to follow these international safety regulations regarding built-in devices, as improper use could lead to hazards. Ensure that children are kept away during operation to prevent burns from hot surfaces. Only trained technicians should perform repairs or service after the unit is turned off and cooled down.

The function switch should be operated with care, using oven mitts or a cloth to prevent burns. High-pressure cleaning should be avoided around electronic components. The built-in clock must be set properly for time management and safety interlock features to work effectively.

In case of heating, ensure that the switches are moved to the desired function before operation. The selection of cooking functions should correspond with the type and amount of food being prepared, taking into account temperature adjustments as necessary.

For optimal roasting results, ensure that the proper shelf heights and food types are utilized as per the guidelines. Always preheat the oven for specific recipes to achieve ideal cooking outcomes.

The timer function allows for short-term cooking reminders, with audible alerts indicating the end of cooking phases. Adjustments can be made if the cooking doesn't meet expectations. The system includes safety features to automatically switch off if left unattended.

When using the oven, ensure that the selected function corresponds to the desired cooking method—whether top heat, bottom heat, or a combination for even results. Follow the provided charts for recommended temperatures to avoid overcooking or uneven results.

Maintain cleanliness and follow maintenance instructions to prolong the life of the oven. Ensure the protective covers and components are secured after any internal adjustments. Proper care and attention to these guidelines will enhance user experience and safety while operating the appliance.

The cooking function has been deactivated, with the AUTO feature transitioning from the cooking actuation to the switch-off mechanism. The system emits a sound alert, and the AUTO indicator blinks. To halt the sound, press the flashing AUTO button; otherwise, the cooking feature remains ineffective as indicated by the continuing AUTO flash. The switching function is demonstrated, and the light signal remains for several hours. Once toggled off, an alert sounds, highlighting the need for button engagement to reset the system's state.

For roasting various meats—such as short cuts or fish—a preheat phase is essential for optimal cooking. Recommended cooking temperatures are provided for items like cakes and bread, which can be classified by their respective recipes. When using functions such as hot air or top heat, precise temperatures are advised to achieve the right cooking results.

Cleaning protocols are essential post-operation; appliances should cool down before cleaning. Steam cleaning and high-pressure techniques are approved for cavity maintenance, while abrasive cleaners should be avoided. Dishwasher-safe items should be regularly cleaned to prevent grease buildup. 

When it comes to electrical connections, ensure that appliances are installed according to safety guidelines provided by standards such as VDE. Proper insulation and connection to suitable power sources must be followed strictly. The installation process must utilize appropriate protective measures and ensure that screws are securely fastened.

For troubleshooting and technical assistance, refer to model-specific instructions. Specifications concerning power ratings and electrical connections are crucial for compliance and operational efficiency. The maximum height for built-in units should be adhered to for safety and functionality.
