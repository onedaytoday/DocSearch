### Installation MAN-TUBIG

**Connecting to M1, M2, M3, and PE:**  
Establish connections for the phases M1, M2, M3, and the Protective Earth (PE). It is recommended to utilize shielded twisted-pair cables to enhance immunity against interference. Ensure that the shielding is grounded correctly; connect the fourth wire to the shield and to the PE, ensuring that the chassis is well-grounded.

**Connecting AC Supply:**  
The AC supply should be connected to terminals AC1, AC2, and AC3 along with the Protective Earth (PE). Again, using shielded twisted pair cables is mandatory for the AC supply to enhance immunity. The four wires from the AC supply must connect properly, with the fourth wire designated for the protective earth.

**Connecting DC Supply:**  
Each DC supply needs to be wired carefully to avoid overheating. If the system is powered down, ensure that connections to the DC supply are secured to prevent unanticipated operations. Properly distribute DC supplies as needed.

**24VDC Auxiliary Supply:**  
For the 24VDC supply, use shielded cables (AWG recommended) to ensure proper safety and noise reduction. The shield should be grounded, and reinforced or insulated cables are recommended to minimize interference. Ensure correct polarity during connection to avoid damage.

### Feedback Systems
**Feedback Configuration:**  
The feedback systems utilize user-friendly configurations. Use shielded twisted-pair wires to connect devices, ensuring the shield is grounded to the chassis. The installation should strictly follow the provided instructions.

**Feedback Types (Feedback A):**  
Feedback mechanisms can be established using interpolated signals and tachometers. Place instructions for assembling feedback devices in line with the guidelines provided in previous sections.

### Feedback Assignments
Feedback assignments include precise connections to functions, ensuring clarity between various inputs and outputs. This requires adherence to table formats and proper functional mapping between the components. Various output formats (such as Emulated and Interpolated) can be selected based on operational requirements.

### Application Notes
**Applications:**  
Feedback mechanisms can be utilized in various configurations, particularly in follower or ECAM systems. It is important to note how to leverage these feedback outputs effectively and to ensure that all instructions are taken from the designated sections for accurate assembly and application.

### Pulse-and-Direction Option
**Pulse-and-Direction Configuration:**  
For systems using pulse-and-direction commands, assign connections clearly between Direction and Auxiliary inputs. Ensure proper labeling and programming of signals to maintain organized operations.

### I/O Configurations
**Setting I/O Types:**  
I/O configurations include Analog Inputs, Digital Inputs, and Digital Outputs. Each type should be programmed according to specific functionality needs, with clear instructions for assembly and operations. Ensure familiarity with the function assignments for successful integration.

### Final Steps
Carefully adhere to these guidelines throughout the installation process to ensure integration accuracy and operational efficiency.
