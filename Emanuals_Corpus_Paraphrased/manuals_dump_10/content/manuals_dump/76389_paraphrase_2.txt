**AM Black Laundry and Additive Guidelines**

To enhance the appearance of both clothing and household items, ensure the proper use of detergents, whether for whites or coloureds. Non-biological options like Fairy are recommended for cleaning purposes. For delicate items, specific products should be chosen over standard bleach products. Stain removers, such as In-Wash Vanish, are effective for heavily stained garments.

**AM Black Washing Instructions**

Traditional powders and liquids can be used, but it's crucial to measure them correctly and follow the washer's instructions. Compact powders and liquids are also available; ensure their placement according to the manufacturer's guidelines.

**Fabric Softeners**

Fabric conditioners can reduce creasing and enhance the feel of easy-care fabrics. Always follow the machine's operating instructions, especially when using products like Bounce conditioning sheets.

**AM Black Drying Guidelines**

Select the drying cycle based on the fabric type and settings provided in the chart. The process varies for items like towels and should ensure that they are completely dry.

**Additional Warnings**

To prevent creasing during drying, distribute laundry evenly in the drum. If using stain action products, be cautious with the settings and ensure proper function is indicated by the control lights.

**Selection of Wash Options**

Choose the appropriate settings based on garment care requirements, such as SPIN SPEED, STAIN, PREWASH, or QUICK WASH, and monitor the indicator lights for feedback on selection status.

**Delayed Start Feature**

The DELAY START option allows you to set a wash cycle to begin later. Confirm your selection through the display and the corresponding countdown timer will start once you press START/PAUSE.

**End of Cycle Indications**

The END light will indicate when a cycle is complete. If the RINSE HOLD option was selected, be prepared for additional action as specified on the control panel. 

**Maintenance and Troubleshooting**

For cleaning, refer to the manufacturer's instructions. Unscrew and clean hoses if needed and ensure they are properly attached. If issues arise, such as error codes, consult the troubleshooting guide or seek professional assistance. 

Ensuring proper operation and care, both during washing and drying, is essential for maintaining fabric integrity and achieving optimal cleaning results.
