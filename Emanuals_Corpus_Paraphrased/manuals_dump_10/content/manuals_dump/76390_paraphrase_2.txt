Here's a more technical paraphrase of the provided text:

Sorting and categorizing laundry items, such as pillowcases, covers, bathrobes, work shirts, tea shirts, nightgowns, and tablecloths, is essential. Place white items and colored items separately to maintain their respective whiteness. New colored items should be washed separately from whites, and appropriate washing instructions should be followed—typically at 60°C for synthetics and easy-care fabrics.

Items labeled as delicates, such as woolens, should be washed under specific conditions. For maintaining the appearance of clothing and household textiles, it is crucial to select the appropriate wash cycles and detergents. Non-biological detergents, like Fairy, and stain removers such as Vanish In-Wash or GloWhite should be utilized for effective cleaning of colored items while avoiding bleach for delicate fabrics.

When using traditional powders or liquids, follow the dosage instructions specified on the packaging. Fabric conditioners can help reduce wrinkles and enhance the softness of easy-care items. Ensure that loads do not exceed the machine's recommended capacity, as overloading can lead to inadequate cleaning and damaged fabrics.

Drying settings should adhere to the type of fabrics. The machine will provide different drying durations as indicated in the chart. For bulky items such as towels, ensure they are fully spread out to achieve thorough drying. Use the appropriate settings to minimize creasing, especially for easy-care fabrics.

In terms of operational controls, select the desired wash or drying program, checking the indicator lights for proper settings. The DELAY START option allows for scheduling washes; the countdown will display after selection. Always ensure that the machine is set to reset after completing a cycle.

Cleaning procedures should include regular maintenance, such as unscrewing and cleaning the hose to prevent blockages. If the machine requires emergency emptying, follow the specific procedures outlined, especially when dealing with temperatures below 0°C to avoid damage.

For optimal efficiency, select economy settings for lightly soiled whites, adjusting the temperature slightly below the recommended 95°C, generally to about 67°C, while maintaining the washing duration as needed. This approach ensures energy savings and effective cleaning for various fabric types while adhering to manufacturer guidelines.

**Troubleshooting Guide**

If you encounter issues such as whistling or error codes while using the appliance, please refer to the troubleshooting instructions below. If errors such as E00, E10, or E20 appear, follow these steps:

1. **Power Check**: Ensure the appliance is connected, the ON/OFF switch is pressed, and the START/PAUSE button is activated. You should hear the door lock securely (for E20 errors).

2. **Hose Issues**: Check the hose connections. If it shows E00, ensure the hose is clean and properly connected. For E10 errors, inspect the positioning of the hose to avoid blockage. Clean thoroughly to resolve any issues.

3. **Manual Redistribution**: If load distribution is uneven, manually adjust the items to ensure proper balance. Use the RINSE HOLD or PUMP OUT options as needed.

4. **Cycle Selection**: Ensure you've chosen the correct cycle for your load type, and that stubborn stains are treated accordingly. If washing with ointments or grease, rinse completely, especially for white items.

5. **Compliance with Regulations**: Adhere to local electrical and plumbing codes during installation. Ensure the hoses and electrical connections meet relevant standards.
