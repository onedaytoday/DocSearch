### CLEANING AND PERFORMANCE

Before operating, ensure that the power cord is completely uncoiled and securely connected. Activate the vacuum using the On/Off switch. The LED lights indicate operational status, while the height adjustment feature is located at the front for optimal cleaning based on your flooring type.

For above-floor cleaning, use the hose and appropriate attachments by connecting them to the accessory cuff. This allows you to effectively clean upholstery, stairs, and other surfaces.

### REPLACING THE DUST BAG

**CAUTION:** Always turn off the vacuum before replacing the dust bag. Open the cover as shown, remove the old bag, and ensure the new bag is seated properly. Check for an accurate fit and secure the cover back in place.

### REPLACING THE BRUSHROLL

**CAUTION:** Turn off the vacuum before servicing. Remove the cover plate by unscrewing the three screws, then replace the brushroll as needed. Ensure components are threaded correctly during reassembly.

### TROUBLESHOOTING AND CONSUMER INFORMATION

**CAUTION:** Turn off the vacuum before troubleshooting. Check the suction hose for blockages, and ensure that connections are secure. For technical issues, contact authorized service for assistance.
