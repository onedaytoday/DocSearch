Chilling cooked food from +90°C to +3°C significantly reduces bacterial activity and preserves food by allowing for subsequent freezing at -18°C, maintaining quality for up to four months. This chilling and freezing process aligns with NF and UK regulations and may include built-in UV sanitation as an optional accessory. The system continuously monitors temperature, featuring a countdown display for service information.

The chilling performance is optimized to reach +3°C from +90°C within four hours, using GN standard containers with specific pitch configurations. It incorporates AISI stainless steel construction and high-density polyurethane insulation, ensuring excellent thermal performance with minimal energy loss. 

Additional features include a HACCP compliance framework, a printer interface for temperature monitoring, and optional sensor probes for enhanced functionality. The cabinet design includes rounded corners for ease of cleaning and is rated for IP20 protection. Installation is flexible, with options for plumbing and collection as needed. The unit is certified by AFAQ AFNOR, confirming adherence to NF031 hygiene standards.
