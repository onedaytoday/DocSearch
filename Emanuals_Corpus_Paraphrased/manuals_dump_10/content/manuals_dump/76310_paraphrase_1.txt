It's important to sort laundry correctly: separate whites, coloreds, and various fabric types (e.g., towels, sheets). Newly colored items should be washed separately to prevent discoloration, and proper treatment may be recommended based on stains or fabric type. Specific cleaning methods can be employed for stubborn stains, using appropriate additives or bleach as necessary.

In addition, refer to the guidelines for the recommended washing temperatures and drying options for different fabric types, while considering the water supply and using the correct amounts of detergent. For cleaning the machine, regularly inspect areas such as the lint trap and filter. Always ensure the machine is powered off and cooled before performing any maintenance. If an error occurs, follow the troubleshooting steps provided in the manual and ensure that all components are functioning correctly.

**Malfunction Resolution Guidelines**

If the system is not functioning, ensure that the hose is properly closed and confirm the settings. Inspect the hose for blockages and verify that the selected options are appropriate.

For stubborn problems, consider increasing the treatment product or changing the selection to improve effectiveness. If a service indicator is illuminated, please contact customer support for assistance. Ensure the device is operating correctly with specific attention to the rating plate information.

**Maintenance Instructions**
