In terms of specifications, the DV-58AV provides seamless playback for recorded CDs and related formats while ensuring compatibility with Windows Media Audio files (WMA), which may incorporate digital rights management (DRM) for protection against unauthorized copying. The player supports variable bitrate (VBR) for MP3 files and displays Chinese characters correctly.

Furthermore, the DV-58AV is equipped with integrated technologies that allow for the playback of CPRM-protected recordings, and it adheres to DVD-RW VR standards, ensuring compatibility across various DVD players.
