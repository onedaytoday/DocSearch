### Chillers Overview

Chillers effectively cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, which helps mitigate bacterial growth. This cooling process allows for safe food storage at +3°C without compromising quality. Chillers utilize advanced designs, often featuring built-in components for enhanced performance.

#### Operating Modes

- **Soft Chilling**: Targets +2°C.
- **Standard Chilling**: Targets +12°C.

The ARTE system allows for adjustable cooling settings, continuously measuring food temperature upon insertion. Chillers can be equipped with built-in or optional UV lights, and include defrosting capabilities. Display screens provide countdowns and service information, ensuring all operating data, including HACCP compliance, is recorded, especially in case of abnormal terminations.

#### Performance Specifications

The chilling capability varies based on food type and quantity, emphasizing efficient cooling.

#### Construction and Finishing

Chillers are constructed with AISI stainless steel and feature high-density polyurethane insulation free of HCFCs. They meet ISO standards and have rounded corners for safety. The models are designed with IP20 protection.

#### Technical Data

- **Productivity**: Adheres to NF and UK chilling regulations.
- **Dimensions**: Various sizes available (e.g., GN type).
- **Power**: Electric models available.

#### Included Accessories

- Single sensor probes for chillers and freezers.
- 3-sensor probes for enhanced monitoring.
- Wheels for portable blast chillers.
- Cook & Chill kits for convenient operation.
- HACCP documentation and connectivity options.
- Optional printer for recording temperature data.

The chillers meet the NF hygiene standards, certified by AFAQ AFNOR, ensuring high cleaning and thermal performance. Various models (e.g., RBC051, RBC061) are available, tailored to specific requirements. Installation may involve plumbing for efficient operation.
