### Defrosting Function: 
To defrost, remove the food from its packaging and place it on the shelf. Cover with a suitable material, as this can significantly speed up the defrosting process. Different food items, like meat and fish (e.g., trout), may require varying defrosting times. For best results, allow the food to defrost further in the refrigerator.

### Drying Function:
Utilize convection heating with shelves that are lined with greaseproof paper. After functioning, turn off the appliance and let it cool overnight. This method is suitable for items like beans, mushrooms, apricots, and pears, which may take several hours to dehydrate properly.

### Cleaning and Warnings:
Always switch off the appliance and let it cool before cleaning. Note: Do not use high-pressure cleaners for safety reasons. **Caution**: Avoid abrasive cleaning agents or scrapers that can scratch surfaces; this may lead to cracking. Clean the exterior with a soft cloth. The self-cleaning feature is effective for managing food splashes. To enable this process, heat the appliance without any food inside, switch it off after one hour, and allow it to cool before cleaning.

### Cleaning Non-Stick Surfaces:
Use a soft cloth to clean non-stick coatings. Avoid scouring pads or abrasive chemicals as they can damage the surface. These items are generally unsuitable for dishwashers.

### Shelf Cleaning:
Begin by cleaning the front of the shelf and then move to the back. Remove the rounded front and clean thoroughly, ensuring to push back any parts that were set forward during cleaning.

### Lighting Warnings:
To prevent electrical shock, switch off the light and disconnect the appliance from the power supply before replacing the light bulb or covering. If necessary, clean the light cover using a heat-resistant cloth.

### Interior Cleaning Instructions:
Ensure the appliance is switched off before cleaning the interior to avoid damage. Start from the upper sections and work your way down. Clean with care to avoid scratching surfaces. 

### Service and Repair Warnings:
If repairs are needed, only qualified service personnel should handle them. Unauthorized repairs may void your warranty. Ensure the appliance is connected to the appropriate electricity supply according to safety standards. Regular maintenance is crucial for optimal performance.
