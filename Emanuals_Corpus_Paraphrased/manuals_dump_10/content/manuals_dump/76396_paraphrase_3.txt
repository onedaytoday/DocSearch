To swiftly select options, you can minimize the settings. Activating the EXTRA RINSE feature is beneficial for users who require additional rinsing for a more thorough wash. If this option is active, an indicator light will illuminate, signifying that it is permanently selected. If interrupted, the countdown timer will reflect the time remaining; a yellow light will indicate an incorrect option choice. For DELAY START, the timer will show the countdown from hours, allowing you to select the desired delay.

Navigating the various settings involves pressing the START/PAUSE button. The DOOR lock indicator will confirm if the door is secured. If interrupted due to an error, the system will cease operation.

When drying, select programs that correspond with the fabric type for effective results. Ensure to consult specific guidelines for drying different items, such as towels, sheets, and synthetics. Follow manufacturer instructions for best practices and adhere to safety measures regarding the temperature settings, especially for synthetic materials.
