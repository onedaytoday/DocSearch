The AOS062EAM1 (59A) and AOS062EAB1 (51A) are designed as streamlined cooking units, specifically the AOS62E model, which incorporates three primary cooking methods: steam (F-266°F), convection (F-572°F), and combination (F-482°F). Each cooking method operates efficiently, with a focus on long-term cooking (LTC) capabilities and memory functions set to factory standards. These units feature LED indicators and a cooking chamber with rounded corners that enhance usability.

The cooking chamber is constructed with thermo-glazed materials that remain cool to the touch, ensuring safety. It holds an IPX5 (NEMA-rated) protection standard and includes an air-o-clean system, along with built-in self-cleaning features. The EKIS software supports HACCP compliance, providing essential monitoring tools. The service offers a two-year warranty and a one-year performance guarantee post-installation.

For professional use, the product is outlined in detail on the Electrolux Professional website, along with contact information. Specific features include dry and humid cooking methods for precise re-thermalization and seafood preparation. The combination function merges convected heat for lighter cooking and re-thermalization processes, patented for efficacy in food holding (also patented). 

The onboard memory allows for storing specific cooking items, and the EKIS software is compatible with PC-based HACCP protocols. The design prioritizes easy cleaning with IPX-rated splash protection, a thermo-glazed cooking chamber, front-hinged access for maintenance, and an integrated hose for cleaning.

Optional accessories and configurations are available, allowing further customization. Additionally, the manufacturer maintains the right to modify product specifications without notice. Important parameters such as clearance for installation and GN steam capacity are also specified for optimal use.
