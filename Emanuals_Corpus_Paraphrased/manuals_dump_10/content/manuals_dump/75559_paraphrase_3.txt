**Introduction**

This document serves to provide guidance on the compliance with the British Council Directive 90/396/EEC regarding the C.E. marking. It includes comprehensive written instructions on the usage of the cooker, aiming to ensure proper cooking of food. The instructions identify various features of the cooker and detail additional components available for specific functionalities. 

### Lighting the Cooker

The cooker’s hotplate requires specific instructions for ignition. To light the burner, adjust to the highest setting and ignite immediately, then release the control. Warning: If there’s a spread of fire, cover it with a cloth or use a fire suffocation method. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure safety while lighting.

### Cooking Tips

Adjust the heat level according to various food items and their required cooking times. Regular monitoring of food is necessary to prevent burning. The heat can be switched from ‘OFF’ to ‘HIGH’ and then down to ‘LOW.’ High settings are ideal for quick cooking, while lower settings are meant for longer, slower cooking processes.

### Preheating

Preheating the cooker is necessary, especially for foods such as Yorkshire pudding or when reheating dishes to ensure even cooking. Place food at the appropriate levels, considering both thickness and cooking time for optimal results.

### Hotplate Use

Adjust the hotplate heat according to the food type: from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' to 'LOW.' Pay attention to the means of cooking to avoid overheating and warping of surfaces. If the hotplate fires, have a fire suffocation method ready. Ensure proper dimensions for cookware to maintain efficiency.

### Cooking Chart

For effective cooking, refer to the provided cooking chart, which outlines the recommended cooking times and temperatures based on food types. Proper thawing of items before cooking is essential for even heating.

### Soups and Reheating 

When preparing soups, bring to a boil and then reduce heat to simmer. For reheating, utilize conventional or microwave methods but limit the frequency for food safety reasons.

### Cleaning

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain cooker performance and prevent the buildup of residues that may cause fire hazards. Use recommended cleaning agents and tools to ensure cleanliness without damaging surfaces. Maintain the crowns and hotplates in good condition, ensuring there are no burnt materials left.

### Maintenance

Ensure the cooker adheres to safety regulations and is serviced according to operational standards. This includes maintaining proper ventilation and ensuring mechanical components are functioning effectively.

### Positioning

Follow guidelines for rack positioning and appliance installation to avoid accidents. Cookware should be of appropriate size to enhance cooking efficiency and safety during operations.
