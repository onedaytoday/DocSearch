To ensure a smooth and accurate installation, please review the following instructions carefully before you begin. Verify that your installation complies with all relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes. These guidelines serve as a reference for installing the fountain. Grounding electrical devices such as telephones and computers to water lines is a common practice, which could either occur within the building or at a location away from it. However, this grounding can result in electrical feedback into the fountain, potentially leading to electrolytic reactions that may cause a metallic taste or an increase in metal content in the water. This issue can be prevented by using the recommended materials specified in these instructions. All drain fittings provided by the installer should be constructed of plastic to provide electrical isolation from the buildingâ€™s plumbing system.

For the water inlet, ensure that the unplated copper tubing connects to the cold water supply service shut-off (not supplied). 

**Important Note:** Any service performed should be done by an authorized technician. 

Refer to the installation instructions for the following components:
- O.D. unplated copper tube connections.
- Proper reinforcement of walls in designated areas.
- Areas for waste outlet connections.

Installation should align with ANSI A117.0 requirements. Ensure proper water supply rough-in as indicated. 

When installing the fountain:
1. Turn off the water supply.
2. Secure the fountain to the wall using specified screws and washers.
3. Use a screwdriver to adjust the stream height as needed.
4. Avoid soldering on tubes that connect with the strainer to prevent damage.

Please follow all outlined guidelines to avoid voiding the warranty and ensure proper functionality. For parts inquiries or further assistance, contact your local distributor or the Elkay Manufacturing Company.
