**Operational Guidelines for Fresh Food Storage**

To ensure optimal performance of the fresh food section in your appliance, follow these instructions related to thermostat settings. The thermostat controls the cooling operation and should be adjusted based on several factors, such as ambient temperature and food load.

1. **Thermostat Settings:** 
   - Use the OFF (O) position when not in use.
   - Set the thermostat to the recommended temperature for fresh food storage (typically around 0°C to 4°C) to maintain quality and freshness.

2. **Timing:** 
   - The thermostat should be adjusted to allow for adequate cooling duration, especially during extended periods of high ambient temperatures. Continuous operation may be necessary to prevent thawing and maintain food safety.

3. **Defrosting Issues:** 
   - If the thermostat is set too high, it may lead to frequent defrosting cycles, affecting the food quality. Monitor food condition regularly to ensure it remains within safe storage temperatures.

4. **Switching Off:** 
   - The thermostat can be switched off when the appliance is not in use. Ensure that the indicator light is functioning properly, indicating that the appliance is in standby.

5. **Maintenance Tips:** 
   - Keep the internal components clean and check the rear spacers for proper positioning to enhance airflow. 
   - If you encounter issues, refer to the troubleshooting section for guidance.
