### Safety Instructions

**WARNING:** To minimize the risk of electric shock or fire while using the washer, adhere to the following instructions. Non-compliance may result in serious injury or death, especially regarding the handling of flammable items that may have been cleaned or exposed to certain cleaning agents. Avoid using the washer while handling items that produce harmful reactions with water or may cause leaks leading to hazardous gases, such as hydrogen.

**Important Notes:** The guidance provided here might not cover every situation. It is your responsibility to protect children from accessing the washer and to ensure they understand how to use the appliance safely.

### Installation and Operation

Ensure the washer is installed in a location that allows for proper grounding and safe service. Follow installation guidelines carefully to prevent serious injuries or equipment damage. If repairs are necessary, seek service from a qualified technician to avoid operational hazards.

### Operating the Washer

Prepare your laundry by sorting items based on their color and fabric type. Combine similar fabrics for optimal washing. Avoid overloading the washer; each load should allow sufficient space for items to move freely. When using detergents, utilize low-sudsing, high-efficiency products. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for bleach use, ensuring measurements adhere to the specified limits.

### Selecting Wash Cycles

To select wash cycles, refer to the control panel options. Ensure that your selection aligns with the fabric types and soil levels of your laundry. Pay attention to the indicator lights, which will confirm your selected settings. Avoid forcing the door open while a cycle is in progress to prevent damage.

### Safety Precautions

Always operate the washer with caution to prevent entrapment and tip-over hazards, particularly if children are present. Regularly review the operation manual to familiarize yourself with features, settings, and sound indications that the washer is functioning correctly.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can maximize the performance and safety of your IQ-Touch Washer.

**Selection and Recommendations for Deep Cleaning and Sanitization**

To ensure thorough cleaning, it is advisable to deep clean and sanitize items like towels and clothing. It is recommended to set the heater to a temperature of 60°C (140°F) or higher to effectively manage bacterial loads. Using bleach or equivalent chemicals is essential for optimal performance. Be aware that NSF International conducts third-party testing to validate health and safety claims. The NSF P172 standard pertains specifically to the performance of family-sized clothes washers.

To ensure efficient operation, the internal heater will activate to maintain the designated temperature. If the heater is engaged while the wash cycle proceeds, the water temperature may fluctuate. Once the water reaches 60°C, a cool-down phase will commence. For casual clothing, adhere to cycle instructions, opting for the appropriate settings for colors and delicate fabrics.

For individuals with asthma or allergies, the internal heater can assist in reducing potential allergens. NSF International has also evaluated health and safety measures pertinent to these cycles. Additionally, ensure that heavy items are rinsed appropriately to prevent odors from lingering in the washer.

**Specialty Cycles and Cleaning Instructions**

Specialty cycles can be selected via the LCD interface, allowing users to choose tailored cleaning settings. The “Jeans” cycle, for instance, is designed to minimize wear while effectively eliminating bacteria.

To clean stuffed animals or toys, it's advisable to secure them properly before washing. Not all cycles are suitable for every type of item, including pet beds. To maintain your washer’s performance, routine cleaning is recommended. This involves manually activating the clean washer cycle when prompted. For regular maintenance, adhere to the routine cleaning schedule to prevent build-up.

For sensitive fabrics like activewear, use precautions such as choosing lighter cycles and avoiding harsh bleach. The steam option can refresh garments while reducing wrinkles, and can be used in conjunction with prewash cycles to tackle tough stains.

**Additional Functions and Safety Guidelines**

Features like “Delay Start” allow flexibility by enabling users to set the washer to begin at a later time. The control panel provides notifications regarding cycle progress and potential issues, such as unbalanced loads.

During the washing process, avoid loading additional items, especially when running the cleaning cycle. Compliance with safe stain removal practices is crucial. Always follow product instructions and keep cleaning agents out of children’s reach.

For effective stain removal, address spills promptly and follow recommended pre-treatment procedures. Use caution when combining cleaning agents to avoid harmful reactions. For thorough pre-treatment, consider the specific instructions for various stains.

In conclusion, utilizing the appropriate settings and adhering to safety guidelines can enhance cleaning effectiveness while protecting both garments and the washing machine.
