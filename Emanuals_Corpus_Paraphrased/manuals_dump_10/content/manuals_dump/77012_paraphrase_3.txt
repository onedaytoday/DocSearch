2. Press <START POINT> and <ENTER> while the <TO FIND> item is illuminated. The system will save this automatically.
3. For the **END POINT**, follow similar steps, allowing the system to set it autonomously.

**NOTE:** Both the START and END POINTS require manual confirmation and can be adjusted later if necessary. Users may select clockwise rotation (RIGHT) or counterclockwise (LEFT) as movement directions. 

**SPEED** configuration determines the rotation speed parameters for the AUTOPAN function, completing the entire path automatically.

For **CRUISE**, once the RUN AUTOPAN is finished, manual control can be activated. Repeat CRUISE functions are accessible, and to begin recording your CRUISE path, follow the listing:
- Press <ENTER> at RECORD START to initiate.
- Complete the RECORD END procedure once your path is set.
- Repeat the manual control for RUN CRUISE.
