**AG-21+22D-UK English MC1751E MC1761E Microwave Operating Instructions**

**Important Notice**: Customers should read the operating instructions for the AEG microwave carefully to understand its features and ensure trouble-free use. Any service information, warnings, or troubleshooting tips noted in this guide should be strictly followed.

**Microwave Operation**: This section covers clock settings, microwave functions, cleaning procedures, and customer service specifications.

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**: Please read carefully and retain for future reference. To prevent fire, do not operate the microwave with food that could overheat or ignite. If food catches fire, do not open the door; turn off the microwave and let the flames extinguish on their own. All containers used must be microwave-safe and free from grease, as grease can ignite. Ensure that the interior, including the cover, cavity, and turntable, is clean.

**Precautions**: Do not attempt to repair the microwave yourself or operate it if you suspect any damage, including warped components or issues with the power supply. Individuals with pacemakers should consult a doctor regarding microwave use.

**Heating Sealed Foods**: Always allow steam to escape from sealed food containers when microwaving to avoid scalding. Foods like eggs in their shells should not be heated in the microwave without being punctured, as they could explode. 

**Child Safety**: Children should not operate the microwave without supervision, and they must be educated on its risks, especially regarding hot food.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**: Ensure all food debris is removed from the turntable and cavity after use. Do not immerse the microwave in water, and avoid using harsh chemicals for cleaning.

**Accessories**: Included with the microwave are the turntable and fixing screws. Ensure proper installation and clearing of items from the cavity before use.

**Microwave Functionality**: The microwave heats food by causing friction in the water molecules. Only use heat-resistant containers to avoid breakage or melting. Covering food prevents splatters and helps maintain moisture.

**Cooking Guidelines**: When cooking or reheating, ensure that food is evenly distributed within the microwave to avoid uneven cooking. Generally, for round foods, place them in the center for optimal heating. Turn food items halfway through the cooking time for even results.

Remember, if the microwave ever fails to operate as intended or if there are any irregularities, consult the service force or authorized technician.

**AG-21+22D-UK ENGLISH: Cooking and Defrosting Guidelines**

When achieving the desired browning for food, it’s important to use appropriate seasonings like browning agents, Worcestershire sauce, or onions. Ready-prepared meals should be heated while covered with a plate or lid to maintain moisture. Foods like coffee should also be heated when covered.

Ensure food is evenly heated by distributing it on the plate. For defrosting in the microwave, use a suitable plate that can withstand high temperatures (up to 100°C). Avoid cooking while defrosting; monitor the food to prevent it from becoming overly thin or uneven. 

When defrosting, ensure larger items are sufficiently thawed before moving to conventional heating methods if necessary. Cook vegetables as you would normally, seasoning them appropriately. Cooking methods for meat, fish, and poultry require thorough heating to ensure food safety.

**Microwave Operation and Power Settings**

To select cooking functions, follow guidelines provided in the manual. Expect variations based on the type of food—soups may require lower power, while meat may need higher settings. The power level can be adjusted by selecting the desired options and then setting the timer accordingly. The microwave's timer will count down once activated. 

**Additional Functions**

The microwave includes a MULTIPLE SEQUENCE COOKING option that allows the user to set different cooking stages. To utilize this function, navigate through the settings using the timer controls.

To quickly initiate cooking, use the START/QUICK feature by pressing it for the desired number of seconds. You can check the current power level by touching the appropriate button without interrupting the cooking process. 

**Automatic Functions**

The AUTOMATIC function simplifies cooking and defrosting. By selecting the appropriate program, input the food's weight, and follow the cooking charts for guidance. The microwave will adjust cooking times automatically for optimal results. 

**Auto Cook and Auto Defrost Charts**

These charts illustrate cooking times for various food items. For example, specific programs are optimized for vegetables, ready meals, and different types of meats. When using the Auto Defrost function, make sure to rearrange food as needed to ensure even thawing.

For best results, always use recommended microwave-safe utensils, ensuring food is appropriately covered during cooking and defrosting to guarantee even heat distribution.

- Specific instructions for defrosting Goulash and other items are outlined, considering their weight and size.

**Vegetable Cooking Guidelines**  
- Adjust cooking times based on the type of vegetable. For instance, whole mushrooms or fresh beans should be pre-cooked.

**Recipe Adaptation for Microwave**  
- When adapting recipes for microwave cooking, consider shortening cooking times significantly. Follow specific guidelines to maintain quality while achieving desired results.

**General Microwave Usage Tips**  
- When toasting or cooking with a microwave, ensure the food is evenly distributed and covered. Certain components like minced meat should be seasoned and cooked thoroughly.
- Avoid using commercial cleaners on the microwave. Clean with a soft cloth and mild detergent, ensuring that the equipment remains in good condition.
