**TT-02 Overview**

Are classrooms becoming less engaging? The OHP (Overhead Projector) classroom may not hold the same excitement anymore. However, the ELMO TT-02 offers an innovative solution that enhances the learning environment. Research indicates that using visual displays significantly improves information retentionâ€”be it for instructional content or mathematics.

The lightweight ELMO TT-02 is designed to meet the needs of educational institutions, especially in light of NCLB (No Child Left Behind) initiatives. Its compact dimensions (42.4cm x 5.3cm x 8.0cm) facilitate easy transportation and switching between different input sources, such as PC or other devices, providing flexibility for various classroom settings.

Key features of the TT-02 include a user-friendly interface and simplified controls. Its shooting capabilities are enhanced by an included camera, allowing for seamless presentation of written material. The device operates at a smooth frame rate (fps), allowing for organized and logical display of hands-on activities.

The TT-02 is not only compact and portable but also incorporates theft protection features. Its automatic brightness control adjusts the display according to lighting conditions, ensuring optimal visibility.
