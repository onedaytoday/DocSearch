The clock display turns off when inactive. When specific functions are selected, options can be activated, such as Heat+Hold. The brightness and sound settings can be adjusted when the system is powered off. To reset to factory settings, the appropriate sequence must be followed. The system indicates the current software version and operational status using a warning sound for selected functions.

Utilizing options for duration, such as Child Lock, Meatprobe, and Steam cooking, a countdown is initiated. To adjust the countdown, repeatedly press the respective button. Users can confirm their selections by pressing the corresponding button. Acoustic signals indicate the progress of the selected cooking function.

For cooking settings involving Temperature and Duration, users can select the timing needed for cooking or switching off. Confirmations are made for either hours or seconds to ensure proper functionality. Different cooking methods can be selected, and the system will indicate when the function is completed through sounds.

The Heat+Hold function can be activated to maintain a temperature of 80°C once confirmed, continuing until the function is completed. The system remains active regardless of the other functions in use.

To protect against unauthorized use, the Child Lock can be activated. The Child Lock function can be turned on or off with an appropriate command. The Meatprobe automatically switches off when the specified cooking temperature is reached and must be replaced with caution during use.

Warning: The Meatprobe should not be removed until the cooking process is complete to avoid burns. Steam cooking may require adjustments depending on cooking duration or times, where sounds indicate operation transitions.

For cleaning instructions, ensure the device is cooled and turned off before using any cleaning methods, avoiding abrasive materials. The Steam Cleaning function can be activated to assist in the cleaning process, which may include heating cycles that signal completion through sounds.
