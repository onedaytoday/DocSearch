The cold storage system includes coolers designed to operate between -2°C and +8°C, featuring varying thicknesses and optional built-in components. These four units come equipped with pre-charged refrigeration systems, highlighting New Assembly Construction techniques that enhance performance, reliability, and efficiency. Insulated with pre-painted polyurethane, they are free of CFCs and HCFCs and have rounded corners. The fast-fit feature ensures the coolers are airtight, utilizing high-grade PVC for easy installation and operation at temperatures up to +43°C. They utilize refrigerant R404A and have both high and low performance metrics. The defrosting system employs heated elements to minimize downtime, alongside internal LED lighting rated at IP54. Included features are an ON/OFF switch, a lighting control switch, and a functioning thermostat. The right-hinged doors are designed with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring airtight sealing and effective insulation, which minimizes energy consumption while allowing easy access per HACCP standards.
