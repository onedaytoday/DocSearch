**Instruction A-10.2 Active**

When setting up a theater, ensure the following products: a primary device and/or VCR. The system should provide sophisticated sound that matches the action onscreen, allowing viewers to perceive sound moving from the right side towards them. This experience is enhanced by the amplifiers designed for in-home theater sound, creating an immersive environment. 

The placement of speakers is crucial, particularly distinguishing between surround and right surround systems, which deliver various sound levels like crashes and other effects. This setup has been effectively utilized for years, contributing to exciting performances. 

**Surround Setup Guidance**

To achieve optimal surround sound, it is recommended to invest in an active subwoofer, which enhances bass output. Connect the cables from the subwoofer to the sound source, ensuring they connect properly to the respective channels. Next, make sure the high-frequency sounds are routed correctly. The system will help manage bass levels, and it's important to note that phase adjustments can influence sound perception, particularly in reducing unwanted bass.

**Acoustic Considerations**

For improved acoustic performance, space the subwoofer adequatelyâ€”avoid corners to mitigate bass distortion. Internal amplifiers should be configured correctly for optimal output.

**User Warnings and Maintenance**

Warning! To prevent electrical shock or device malfunction, avoid covering ventilation openings. Refer to the user manual for important warnings about safe operation and service protocols.

For troubleshooting, if no sound is heard, ensure the device is turned on and properly connected to the input. Please consult the troubleshooting guide for additional assistance.
