**Additional Features:**  
The EWT series allows customization for each load, offering options to save water and energy while ensuring that clothes are thoroughly cleaned. Keep in mind that loading the washer beyond recommended capacity can impact performance.

Please refer to the color-coded settings for different fabrics, such as synthetic materials, cottons, and delicate items. Pre-treatment of heavily soiled clothes is advisable for optimal results.

When using bleach, ensure you follow the specific instructions for your chosen type—some models might restrict the use of certain bleach types to prevent damage.

**Operating Instructions:**  
To start the machine, press the power button, select your desired cycle, and adjust the settings as necessary. The display will indicate the selected options. It is essential to review the instructions thoroughly to understand how to efficiently use the machine and achieve the best results for your laundry needs.

**Operating Instructions Overview:**

You have several options to choose from based on fabric type: heavy garments, light clothing, and items needing freshening. To adjust settings, press the appropriate button to increase or decrease the wash temperature, which can be either standard or lightweight. 

When selecting an option, ensure the correct amount of water is chosen for the load. If the selected quantity appears too high or low, adjust accordingly. Once the machine starts, you’ll see a countdown indicating the time remaining. If it doesn’t start within a few seconds after selection, check if the door is properly closed and locked.

You can toggle through different modes by repeatedly pressing the highlighted button. Each selection provides relevant information about the washing cycle. Additionally, remember to ensure the washer is turned off after use and to monitor for any warning indicators about maintenance needs.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Regular upkeep is recommended to optimize performance. Inspect the washer, especially the detergent dispenser, for buildup, which can be removed easily with a toothbrush or similar tool. Use mild cleaners and avoid harsh chemicals that can damage components.

When washing, pay attention to fabric types. Separate lighter colors from dark ones to prevent color transfer. If you notice yellowing or buildup, consider re-washing with the appropriate cycle or adjustments. For stains, treat them promptly with suitable stain removers before washing.

**Stain Treatment Suggestions:**

- **For Grease and Oil:** Scrape the excess off, then use a stain remover.
- **Coffee or Tea:** Blot and treat with a cleaning solution designed for such stains.
- **Fruits and Foods:** Remove as much residue as possible and apply stain treatment before washing.

Adhere to recommended washing practices to avoid damages to fabrics and ensure the longevity of your clothing. If necessary, use hot or cold water settings based on fabric care labels for optimal results.

**Important Note:** Always follow safety recommendations when dealing with chemicals and cleaning agents to avoid damage to the fabrics and washing machine.
