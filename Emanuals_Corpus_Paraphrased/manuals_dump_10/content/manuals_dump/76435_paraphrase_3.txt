**Dryer Instructions Summary** 

After pressing the appropriate buttons, ensure the dryer is turned off. Use the drying cycle only for cotton or synthetic items. If drying synthetic items, select the corresponding setting. Always check that the filter and hose are clear and that the dryer is empty before starting a cycle. 

To avoid excessive creasing, redistribute items during the drying process if necessary. The dryer will automatically enter a cooling phase as part of the cycle. 

**Washing and Drying Programs** 
Use the non-stop washing and drying program for cotton and synthetics. For optimal performance, differentiate between fabric types (e.g., whites, coloreds, synthetics). Ensure loads are not too tightly packed to maintain efficiency.

**Sorting Laundry**
Sort laundry into whites, coloreds, and synthetics while adhering to the indicated temperature guidelines. Wash new colored items separately to prevent bleeding. 

**Stain Removal**
For stubborn stains, pre-treat affected areas, especially for grease and makeup, using appropriate stain removal techniques before washing.

**Detergents and Additives**
Choose detergents based on fabric types, with higher temperatures preferred for whites. Follow guidelines for water hardness when selecting detergents and additives.

**Drying Guidance**
Prepare for the drying cycle by ensuring vent hoses are correctly connected. Certain items, such as delicate fabrics or items with specific care labels, may not be suitable for drying.

**Maintenance**
Regularly clean the lint filter and drum to maintain dryer efficiency. Perform maintenance washes periodically and keep the washing drum and dispenser clean as detailed in the manual. Disconnect the power before attempting any cleaning or maintenance tasks.

Always refer to the dryer manual for specific guidelines related to programs, loading capacities, and care instructions.
