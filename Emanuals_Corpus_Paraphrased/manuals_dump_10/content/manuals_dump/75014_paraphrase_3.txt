The EI24MO45IB and EI30MO45TS models are part of the Cook-2-Perfection series, featuring built-in microwaves with side-opening doors and an IQ-Touch control panel that includes a LED display. These stainless steel appliances operate at 120V/60Hz and must maintain appropriate clearance during installation. It is important to comply with installation guidelines to ensure safe operation. The duct assembly must be positioned at the top right rear and should not interfere with other built-in appliances. Please note that the model numbers EI30MO45TS and EI27MO45TS are also relevant for this installation.
