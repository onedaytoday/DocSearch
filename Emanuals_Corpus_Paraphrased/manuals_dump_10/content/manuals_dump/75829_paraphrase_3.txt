Water circulates through the back panel of the chamber, where it continuously operates alongside systems for cooling and lighting. For optimal performance, products must be arranged properly and tightly, ensuring adequate airflow and preventing frost accumulation at the outlet. If products are too closely packed, it can impede airflow and lead to frost build-up. 

To maintain the equipment efficiently, the thermostat may need adjustment for higher or lower settings, alongside regular cleaning of the chamber back panel and outlet. Follow the instructions detailed in Chapter Four for proper service and troubleshooting.
