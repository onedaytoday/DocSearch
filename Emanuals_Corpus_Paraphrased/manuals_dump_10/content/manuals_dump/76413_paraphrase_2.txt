Based on the RABC framework, measures proposed by experts emphasize the importance of effectively managing laundry and cleaning processes to safeguard against healthcare-associated infections while ensuring the protection of clothing items. The threat posed by soiled items to health necessitates a structured approach to the workflow and processing, where items categorized as dirty demand careful handling to avoid additional contamination.

Trolleys utilized for transporting laundry must meet specific criteria to maintain infection control standards. For example, different colored trolleys are designated for various types of itemsâ€”such as one for towels, one for sheets, and others for gowns and catering linens. These must be clearly identified and utilized correctly, ensuring that they remain closed and securely managed to prevent exposure to contaminants.

The washing process must adhere to prescribed protocols, including meticulous drying and finishing techniques recommended by professionals. Items should be dealt with immediately post-washing, either by transporting them to a designated area or ironing them to ensure they meet hygiene standards. Care should be taken to avoid overloading machines, which can hinder effective cleaning and drying.

For protection, it is vital to maintain cleaned trolleys and ensure they're equipped with appropriate covers or are enclosed. This minimizes the risk of contamination from external sources and enables effective cleaning and disinfection of both the trolleys and their contents. Moving forward, integrated workflows for cleaning and disinfection should be strictly adhered to, ensuring all processes align with established infection control measures.
