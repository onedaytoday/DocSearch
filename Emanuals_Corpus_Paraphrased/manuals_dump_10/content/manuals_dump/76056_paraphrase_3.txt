### OWNER'S GUIDE

#### IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS
To minimize the risks of fire, electric shock, or personal injury, adhere to the following precautions: 

- Always turn off the appliance when it is not in use or during maintenance.
- Allow the unit to cool down before cleaning or servicing.
- Use only recommended attachments and do not allow the appliance to function as a toy.
- Avoid using the cord if it is frayed or damaged, and keep it clear of hot surfaces or sharp edges.
- Do not pull the cord around corners or use it in close proximity to heat sources.
- Ensure the cord is not taut or subjected to unnecessary stress.
- Maintain cleanliness by ensuring that the hose, filters, and any ventilation are free of debris to prevent overheating.

#### SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOUSEHOLD USE ONLY
To reduce the risk of electric shock, do not use the appliance in areas exposed to moisture or where it could fall into water. If the device shuts off automatically, ensure the on/off switch is in the “off” position before troubleshooting or service.

### READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USE
**WARNING!**

### UNPACKING AND CHECKING CONTENTS 
Carefully remove all components from the carton and ensure that nothing is missing. Check the included accessories such as hoses and upholstery tools.

#### OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
- Connect the hose to the canister, ensuring it clicks into place.
- Use the on/off switch to control power and adjust the suction level accordingly.
- For optimal performance on various surfaces, adjust the cleaning height using the control located at the rear of the nozzle.

#### MAINTENANCE 
- **Replacing the Dust Bag (S-BAG):** Replace when the indicator light shows red.
- **Replacing the Exhaust Filter:** Change the filter when prompted by the indicator. Follow the alignment instructions carefully.
- **Replacing the Motor Filter:** Change according to the guidelines provided in the manual.

#### CLEANING THE HOSE
Ensure the hose is clear of blockages and debris regularly; let it cool before maintenance. Note that damage during cleaning may void your warranty.

#### BELT REPLACEMENT
To replace the belt (model EL097), allow the unit to cool before disassembly. Remove the screws and access the interior as instructed.

### IMPORTANT: Always refer to the official instructions before using or servicing your vacuum cleaner.
