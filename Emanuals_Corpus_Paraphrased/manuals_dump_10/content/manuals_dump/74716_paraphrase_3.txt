### Important Safety Instructions

These guidelines are crucial for ensuring safe use and maintenance of the appliance. Heavy items should not be overloaded. Ensure that the appliance matches the power supply specifications. Avoid placing it near heat sources or leaving it in direct sunlight. Always adhere to the provided instructions regarding proper ventilation at the rear.

Before maintenance, switch off the device to allow it to settle. The interior should maintain a compatible temperature to maximize efficiency. Be cautious of ignition sources. It's vital to prevent children from playing with the appliance due to risks of suffocation or other hazards.

Only authorized technicians should handle the cooling system, which should never be accessed by untrained individuals. Avoid using the appliance around open flames or extreme heat. 

Important: Liquid items like carbonated beverages must not be frozen, as they can burst. Follow manufacturer guidelines for cleaning, service, and repairs—unqualified attempts can lead to serious issues.

### Description of the Appliance

- **Food Compartments**  
- **Operational Controls**: The yellow main-on light indicates power. The thermostat is located at the top and can be adjusted to regulate internal temperatures. 

### Operation Instructions

To operate, turn the thermostat to the desired setting. If the red warning light activates, it indicates that the internal temperature has reached a critical level. The optimal cooling process may take several hours, and food should be evenly distributed to promote effective freezing.

After the cooling period, switch off the power by turning off the thermostat. Consult the manual for the best practices concerning the food items and avoid overcrowding, as this may impede airflow and affect performance.
