### Revised Text:

The section regarding operation instructions emphasizes the need to maintain proper temperature and avoid unintentional closure of the appliance, which can impede air circulation and lead to mold growth. To regulate temperature, adjustments can be made using the warmer or colder settings. When the desired temperature is reached, the appliance will notify you via a visual display or audible alerts.

If the temperature exceeds safe limits, a door warning alert will sound after a few seconds. If this occurs, it’s advisable to rearrange or remove items to restore normal conditions. Acknowledging the warning is necessary, and it will deactivate automatically once optimal conditions are reestablished.

To manage the internal environment correctly, it is crucial to monitor the shelves and ensure proper height adjustment for optimal loading. It's recommended to check food temperatures with a thermometer regularly, particularly at the lowest shelf where meat and perishable items are stored. 

For defrosting, it’s essential to periodically clear ice buildup, typically once a year or when frost reaches a significant thickness. Always follow the provided operating instructions to avoid damage to the appliance or food products.

Cleaning procedures require disconnecting the appliance from power supply. Use appropriate cleaning methods and avoid harsh chemicals. Light fixtures can be replaced as needed, following safety precautions.

In case of operational issues, an alert, such as a warning tone or flashing light, indicates a malfunction. Users are encouraged to consult the support section for troubleshooting or contact service providers for assistance.

Lastly, compliance with relevant EU regulations is noted, ensuring consumer protection and adherence to safety standards for electrical appliances.
