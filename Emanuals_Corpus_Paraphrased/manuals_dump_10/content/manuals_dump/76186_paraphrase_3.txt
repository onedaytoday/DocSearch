**Read and Retain These Instructions**  
**For Domestic Cooking Applications Only**  
**Important Notes**: For duct-free installations, purchase the appropriate cover and follow the guidelines for ducted installations.

#### Safety Warnings:
To minimize the risks of fire, electric shock, or personal injury, adhere to the following instructions:

- If servicing or cleaning, switch off the power and disconnect the service securely.
- Follow all electrical safety measures, especially concerning fire-rated materials and combustion appliances.
- Consult the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) for additional standards and safety protocols.

**Grease Fire Safety**: 
- For grease fires, smother flames and turn off the heat. 
- Avoid burns; if the fire becomes uncontrollable, evacuate and call the fire department immediately. 
- Do not attempt to carry a flaming pan. Never use water or dishcloths; utilize a Class ABC extinguisher only. Ensure you are familiar with the source of the fire and that you can safely fight it.

#### Installation Preparations:
- Unpack the Range Hood and ensure you have the Damper/Duct Connector and the required screws for assembly.
- For ducted installations, mount the round duct plate and connect it securely.

**Planning Ductwork Installation**:  
- Ensure duct runs are as short as possible with minimal elbows for optimal performance.
- Avoid venting into an attic due to grease buildup hazards.
- Use only metal ductwork; secure all connections to contain any potential grease fires effectively. Tape all joints to ensure an airtight seal.

#### Range Hood Location:
- Install the hood so its bottom is above the cooking surface; the top front edge should align with the cabinet frame.
- If there’s a gap between the back of the hood and the wall, it’s normal for certain installations; adjust accordingly.

**Mounting the Range Hood**:  
- Ensure accurate measurements using the keyhole slots and install the screws as specified in the manual.
- Follow electrical connection guidelines and secure all wiring connections, matching the wire colors appropriately.

#### Operation and Maintenance:
- To operate, turn the switch clockwise to activate the blower and adjust the speed as necessary.
- Regularly clean the filters to maintain cooking efficiency; they are dishwasher safe for convenience.
- For light bulb replacement or fan assembly removal, refer to the specified connection diagrams.

#### Service Parts Reference:
Consult the service parts list for any necessary replacements or hardware; items can be purchased locally as specified.
