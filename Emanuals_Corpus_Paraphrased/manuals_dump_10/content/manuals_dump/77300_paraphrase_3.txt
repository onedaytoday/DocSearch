## BEFORE USE
- **Location Selection:** Choose a location free from direct sunlight and heat sources. Ensure adequate space (approximately 2 inches) around the unit.
- **Memory Function:** The unit has a memory function to retain settings. Disconnecting power may affect memory; consult instructions for preservation techniques.

## CONNECTION
- **FM Indoor Antenna:** Use a lead-type FM antenna (75 ohm) for optimal reception. 

### Speaker Connection (AC)
- Connect speaker wires securely to ensure proper function without short-circuiting risk. Red and black wires should be connected correctly to ensure clear audio output.

## SURROUND SOUND CONNECTION
- Position surround speakers correctly to enhance three-dimensional sound effects. Ensure speakers are at a height slightly above ear level for optimal acoustics.

### Connecting Devices: DVD Players, Televisions, and Other Equipment

To connect devices like DVD players, receivers, or set-top boxes, it's preferred to use S-VIDEO connections directly to achieve optimal clarity. Alternatively, RCA connections can also be employed, either directly or through an adapter. This setup allows both DVD and VCR output to be routed to the TV's input.

When connecting the DVD or VCR, select the appropriate TV input corresponding to the connected device. You can switch inputs on the TV to display content from the DVD or VCR. For devices with RCA outputs, connect them to the TV's RCA inputs, ensuring proper signal flow.

For enhanced audio, it's advisable to utilize DTS or surround sound processing. Various surround modes (e.g., MOVIE, MUSIC, THEATER, and HALL) are also available to optimize the listening experience, with COAXIAL IN and OPTICAL IN inputs located on the back of the device. If RCA connections are utilized, ensure that the white (L) and red (R) cables are correctly connected. These connections serve as a safeguard against signal loss.

### Connecting CD and Tape Jacks

For CD players or tape decks, use RCA cables to connect (white for L, red for R) to the respective digital in/out terminals. If using digital connections, connect CD or MD players via their designated DIGITAL IN/OUT ports.

### Remote Control Unit Functionality

The remote control operates the receiver from a distance, but its effectiveness may be impacted by nearby obstacles. To facilitate ease of use, a simple button layout is provided at the front of the device, including the POWER button. 

**Battery Installation:**
Ensure the cover is securely attached after inserting AAA batteries in the correct orientation.

- **TAPE DECK Connections:** Connect to external tape players/recorders.

### Basic Operation

1. **Power On/Off:** Use the POWER button to switch on or standby the unit.
2. **Select Input:** Turn the INPUT SELECTOR to choose the desired audio input (e.g., DVD, TUNER, AUX).
3. **Volume Control:** Adjust the MASTER VOLUME for desired sound levels.
4. **Surround Sound:** Utilize DTS/DOLBY DIGITAL for enhanced audio output or select appropriate surround modes.

This setup allows for versatile integration of audio and visual equipment to enhance the home entertainment experience.

### Basic Operation

To use the **PHONES** feature, connect headphones to the 1/4-inch jack; the output will automatically switch to **STEREO** mode. The **AV input** allows for connection with devices such as VCRs through **Right input** and **S-VIDEO**. You can adjust **BASS** and **TREBLE** to enhance low and high frequencies, respectively, using the **MASTER VOLUME** control.

**DTS-ES** allows for independent surround back sound channels, providing high-fidelity surround playback with enhanced audio quality.

### Radio Operations

To turn on the unit, press the **POWER** button, then switch from **STANDBY** to **ON**. Use the **INPUT SELECTOR** to choose **TUNER** and select either the **FM** or **AM** band. For station scanning, press **AUTO/MANUAL**. The **TUNING** button enables manual or automatic tuning for station selection. To save stations in memory, press **MEMORY** while tuning to a station.

### Radio Data System (RDS)

The **RDS** feature provides information broadcasted by FM stations. To use it, press **DISPLAY** to show details such as **PS, PTY, CT**, and **RT**. Depending on reception quality, these may indicate service types; if the information is not available, "NO PS," "NO PTY," etc., will appear.

The **PTY SEARCH** function allows users to find specific genres like **NEWS** or **SPORT** by tuning to the desired types. The **APS Search** function scans and stores well-received stations into memory.

### Video Operations

To switch to video input, choose either **DVD**, **VIDEO**, or **VIDEO 2** via the **INPUT SELECTOR**. For audio output from these sources to the TV, ensure the correct connections are made between the **AV amplifier** and the **TV**.

### Delay Time and Dynamic Range Control

**DELAY TIME** settings can be adjusted for surround sound using the **DELAY** buttons for **CENTER** and **REAR** channels. The **DYNAMIC RANGE CONTROL (DRC)** helps manage sound levels for a balanced listening experience.

### Test Tone and Channel Select

Activate the **TEST TONE** feature to calibrate the speakers. Make adjustments to the **MASTER VOLUME** during the test to ensure an optimal level of sound from all channels. The **LOW FREQUENCY EFFECT (LFE)** will be activated when using formats like AC3 or DTS.

### Troubleshooting

If you experience sound issues, check the connections and settings. Incorrect polarity or disconnected input cords may cause imbalances. Ensure the remote battery is functioning, and consider reducing the distance between the remote and the receiver for optimal performance.
