For optimal cleaning results, sort your laundry into whites, colors, and delicate fabrics, following the specific care instructions and recommendations provided in this guide.

**Laundry Guide for Whites and Colors**

When washing fabrics like towels, tablecloths, and sheets, it's essential to separate whites from colors. Wash whites first to maintain their brightness. For new colored items, follow the care labels, and consider pre-treating stains with recommended products. Avoid overloading the machine, especially with synthetic fabrics, as this can hinder cleaning effectiveness.

When dealing with stubborn stains like grease or lipstick, treat them immediately with bleach (only for whites) or appropriate stain removers. Make sure to wash items at the recommended temperatures, typically at or above 60°C for optimal cleaning.

**Machine Care**

To ensure proper functionality, regularly clean the washing machine. Disconnect from the power source before performing maintenance. Check and clear the washing chamber and any hoses of blockages.

**Emergency Emptying Procedure**

In case of a malfunction, follow the steps to empty the hose safely. Always make sure the appliance has cooled down prior to handling. If temperatures are low (below 0°C), ensure hoses are appropriately managed to prevent freezing.

**General Precautions**

Maintain safe practices by verifying that connections comply with local regulations. If replacing components, use certified parts only. For any service-related inquiries, consult the manufacturer’s guidelines available online or through customer support. 

**Recycling and Disposal**

When disposing of the appliance, adhere to local recycling protocols to minimize environmental impact. For further recycling information, refer to the product's instruction manual or the retailer where it was purchased.
