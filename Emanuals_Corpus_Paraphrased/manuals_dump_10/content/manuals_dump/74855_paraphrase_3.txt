### Overview of Fan Oven Usage

**Fan Oven Functionality**  
The fan oven circulates heated air from the rear, ensuring uniform cooking. 

**Preheating**  
Preheating is essential, typically reaching temperatures around 200-220°C. If not preheated, achieving the recommended cooking temperature may take longer, particularly for prepared meals or baked goods.

**Cooking Temperatures**  
For optimal results, adhere to the recommended temperatures, reducing them by 20-25°C when necessary.

**Batch Baking**  
When baking multiple items, ensure to position them correctly on the oven shelves to facilitate proper air circulation.

### Oven Shelf Adjustment

**Fitting Shelves**  
Shelves must be installed straight and aligned towards the back. Proper placement enhances cooking efficiency.

**Hints**  
- Use the central shelves for better heat distribution.
- Maintain adequate spacing between items for optimal cooking.

### Cooking and Roasting Charts

**Oven Cooking Chart**  
Follow specific temperature and time guidelines as outlined in the chart. For roasting, increase temperatures if specified, and monitor internal temperatures to ensure thorough cooking.

**Defrost Feature Usage**  
This setting is more advantageous for delicate items, such as frosted cakes and meat. Always defrost food completely before cooking and do not leave defrosted items out for extended periods to avoid bacterial growth.

### Care and Cleaning of the Oven

**General Precautions**  
Always disconnect the power before cleaning, and allow the oven to cool. Use suitable cleaning products to preserve surfaces and avoid bleach or abrasive materials.

**Cleaning Ceramic Hobs**  
Daily cleaning with appropriate products is key to preventing the buildup of burnt residues. If stubborn marks appear, specific non-stick cleaners can be used.

**Maintaining Stayclean Surfaces**  
Stayclean surfaces should be wiped regularly; allowing them to remain dirty can reduce their effectiveness. Clean with gentle methods, and avoid aggressive scrubbing.

**Cleaning Door Glass**  
For optimal visibility, regularly clean the inner and outer glass surfaces with appropriate cleaners. If any part becomes damaged, consult a professional for replacement.
