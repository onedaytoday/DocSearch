### Conclusion
This summary provides essential information on the Steam EWF 127570W's operation, maintenance, and safety. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure effective use and longevity of the appliance.

For optimal results, ensure the cloth is fresh and free from grease before washing, whether it has been left overnight or is cold. If using bleach, apply it cautiously to whites and colors only. For items like lipstick, treat stains with bleach as needed. 

When washing, it's advisable to prewash items if they require thorough cleaning, preferably at 60°C. Select the right type of cleaning additives based on the fabric. It's crucial to follow guidelines on detergent quantities and water classifications provided by your local authority for effective results.

Utilizing the steam function can significantly reduce creasing in garments. The program options, such as Spin Reduction and Extra Rinse, can be selected based on your laundry needs. If the 'Prewash' option is not in use, be mindful of the potential for less effective cleaning.

Regular cleaning of the machine components, including the filter and spray arms, is necessary for optimal performance. When performing maintenance, ensure the machine is unplugged, and always consult the user manual for specific instructions.

In case of an error or malfunction, identify the error code and act accordingly. If the machine doesn't drain properly, ensure that the hoses are clear and securely attached. If issues persist, consider redistributing contents to maintain balance during the wash cycle.

For assistance with any technical issues or to understand the operation better, refer to the EEC technical criteria or contact customer service as needed. Following the correct procedures will ensure the machine operates efficiently and extends its lifespan.

**Water Warning!** This device is connected to the water supply. Ensure the hose is properly threaded to connect with the supply line. If necessary, replace the existing hose with a suitable length to facilitate proper connection. The position of the hose should be adjusted to ensure it runs correctly, either upwards or to the right. 

If the hose is too short, consider purchasing a specific extension to accommodate the necessary length. Water should not be collected excessively. Use the hose with caution to prevent any blockage during operation. Ensure that the hose is securely fastened or connected to the designated branch, keeping it at least a certain height above the ground.

For proper maintenance, consult the service information provided on the rating plate. Make sure the device is grounded and comply with safety regulations. If any issues arise, contact household services or the point of purchase for guidance on recycling. For operational efficiency, it’s suggested to wash without prior rinsing, given that the model offers protection during use. Always adhere to the provided instructions for the best results.
