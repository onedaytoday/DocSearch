**SANTO TK Operating Instructions**  

To our customers, please refer to these operating instructions for essential information regarding the appliance. These instructions are designed for the owners and provide technical guidance relevant to its operation. Please pay careful attention to the warnings and notes included, particularly the information concerning the appliance’s functions and the cloverleaf symbol. For technical terminology, refer to the section titled "Technical Terminology." This guide includes troubleshooting tips for common malfunctions found in the "What to Do If" section. Should you require further assistance, we recommend contacting an authorized service center.  

**Appliance Overview**  

Please ensure the appliance is set up in accordance with the initial setup and switching guidelines for optimal food preparation and defrosting. The appliance will defrost automatically and needs regular cleaning. In case of malfunctions, consult the correction section. Be aware of the recommended conditions under which food should be stored to prevent spoilage or damage.  

If you notice any issues with cooling or food quality, refrain from using non-compatible products and seek help from an authorized service provider. Use caution with materials that may generate high heat or pose a risk of ignition. Keep the area around the appliance free from obstructions, ensuring ventilation and protection against heat and sunlight.

**Installation and Maintenance**  

The appliance must be installed in a well-ventilated area away from heat sources. Ensure there’s adequate clearance around the back and top for proper airflow. Installation instructions involve securing screws and ensuring all components are properly connected. Ensure the appliance is grounded as indicated in the electrical rating section.  

**Operating the Appliance**  

To switch on or adjust the appliance, rotate the thermostat clockwise. This controls temperature settings, ensuring food remains at suitable temperatures (between +5°C and -18°C). It is crucial to monitor the temperature to keep food fresh and safe. If frost builds up, follow the recommended defrosting procedures.  

For shelf organization, adjust the height to accommodate various food items, ensuring proper airflow. Keep food items covered using airtight wraps to prevent contamination and spoilage. Foods should be allowed to cool before being placed inside the appliance to minimize frost formation.

For proper defrosting, the appliance will automatically handle frost buildup when activated. Should you need to switch off the appliance, adjust the thermostat to the off position or disconnect it from the power supply as necessary.

### Defrosting Instructions

**Defrosting the Compartment**

Remove frost buildup from the compartment when it reaches a thickness of at least 5mm. This process should typically be performed at least once a year or when the frost interferes with food storage. Avoid using any heating tools or mechanical devices to expedite defrosting, as this can lead to health hazards or damage to components. 

**Warning**: When defrosting, ensure you switch off the appliance and disconnect it from the electrical supply. Use layers of newspaper to absorb water, and place a container beneath to catch excess moisture.

**Cleaning Process**

The interior should be cleaned regularly to maintain hygiene. **Warning**: Always switch off the appliance and disconnect it from the electrical supply before cleaning to avoid electric shock. Use a mild cleaner and a cloth. Avoid abrasive materials that could damage the surface.

Allow food to cool before cleaning, and ensure everything is switched off prior to maintenance to keep the appliance in good condition.
