### Conclusion
This manual provides critical information for the safe and efficient operation of the MT3600 and MT4000 models. Follow all instructions carefully to maximize safety and performance.

**WARNING**: The ANSI standards relate to safety features that aim to mitigate the effective risks associated with using the equipment. Users should be vigilant about the performance of their machines, especially if any warning indicators are triggered. Prompt attention is needed in such cases. It's crucial that the equipment is assembled correctly and securely, particularly when handling the throttle mechanism. Refer to the Carburetor Section for operational details. Note that any service should align strictly with provided instructions. Improper servicing may lead to catastrophic failures. 

**SAFETY PROTOCOLS**: Ensure the control system is disengaged when servicing or cleaning the unit. The equipment should not be elevated or operated without the necessary precautions. Users must wear protective gear to safeguard against burns and other injuries encountered during operation.

For assembly, adhere strictly to the guidelines. Make sure to use the specified tensioning screw and inspect clutch assembly components thoroughly for correct positioning. The clutch cover must be secured properly to prevent malfunctions. Note that if the clutch cover is loose, it must be reassembled to ensure functional integrity.

**OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES**: Proper chain tension must be maintained during operations to avoid overheating and ensure efficient cutting performance. New chains may require frequent adjustments as they tend to stretch. Regularly check chain tension and make necessary adjustments to maintain optimal functionality.

**FUEL SPECIFICATIONS**: Utilize only unleaded gasoline with the specified octane rating to ensure engine efficiency. Avoid using automotive or 2-cycle oils, as they lead to operational issues. 

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**: When starting the engine, follow the specified throttle and operational protocols to minimize risks. During operation, maintain a clear workspace and ensure proper personal protective equipment is worn. 

Warnings and operational procedures specified in the manual must be followed diligently to ensure safety and equipment longevity. 

**STARTING PROCEDURES**: When starting, ensure all areas around the unit are clear of personnel and obstructions. Pay attention to throttle positions and environmental conditions that may affect engine operation. If flooding occurs, follow the outlined troubleshooting steps to restore functionality without delay.

Remember, while performing any adjustments or repairs, the chain must never be in motion, especially during idle. Proper maintenance of the RPM settings is crucial for safe operation.

### OPERATION: Chain to Safety-Chain Section

The operation involves two key components, (A) and (B), as shown below. The procedure should be carried out as follows: 

1. Securely grip the throttle with your dominant hand and maintain a firm hold on the front handle while operating the device.
2. As the device rotates, ensure you are aware of your surroundings to safely operate and service it.
3. Be cautious while backing away from the device (right side and front) and ensure there are no obstructions in your vicinity.

**WARNING:** If you encounter immediate danger, cease operation and seek assistance. Take note of tree conditions such as high winds or heavy foliage, as these can affect safety. Avoid improper cutting, notching, or working with compromised trees. If a tree splits or is unstable, evacuate the area.

### OPERATION: Cutting Technique

When cutting, always leave the saw and prioritize your safety. Clear the area around the tree and assess the terrain to ensure stability. Be mindful of any hazards, like rotting wood, stones, or other obstructions, that may impact the felling direction.

Establish a notch on the tree, approximately one-quarter of the tree's diameter, which will direct its fall. The notch must be straight and well-defined, creating a pathway for the backcut. When making the backcut, ensure it is 2-4 inches above the bottom of the notch to prevent pinching.

**WARNING:** Always maintain a clear path and avoid working with unsupported trees. Never allow another person to operate or be near the device during this process. 

### MAINTENANCE: Chain Care

Chains must be sharpened properly to maintain optimal performance. Inspect for wear and ensure that clearance is adequate, adjusting as needed. Teeth should be free from debris, and the chain should move smoothly. The tension should be checked regularly in accordance with safety guidelines.

**WARNING:** Incorrect sharpening can lead to serious injuries. Ensure to wear protective gear during maintenance.

### MAINTENANCE: Proper Cleaning and Compliance

Follow the maintenance guidelines to prevent overheating or other safety issues. Ensure that the unit complies with CARB and EPA regulations. Inspect all components periodically, and follow specified procedures for adjusting RPM levels. Regular cleaning is crucial, particularly after extensive operation. 

**WARNING:** Failure to adhere to these maintenance guidelines could increase the risk of fire or malfunction. If any component becomes compromised, seek professional repair. 

### CMR6A MAINTENANCE: Cooling System

Ensure the cooling assembly is free from obstructions, as overheating can lead to serious malfunctions. Regular cleaning is essential—allow the unit to cool before performing maintenance and check for any debris blocking airflow.

**WARNING:** Follow safety regulations to prevent any accidents, fires, or equipment failure.

### Maintenance Instructions

**Shield and Cover Maintenance**  
Ensure the shield (C) cover (D) and screw (F) and (G) are properly maintained. Clean and inspect component (A) before reassembling, ensuring the screw is secured. 

**Warning:** Improper assembly of the shield or other components could increase the risk of fire and hearing damage. If the shield or assembly appears damaged or excessively worn, replace the entire unit with part number 50050204A (G). Properly mount the replacement to avoid safety hazards.

**Warning:** The clutch cover must be evaluated for wear. If the band (A) is found to be too thin, consult an authorized service provider for replacement options. Repairs should only be conducted by a certified technician utilizing parts provided at the point of purchase.

**Chain Maintenance**  
When servicing or cleaning, follow all manufacturer guidelines to maintain optimal performance.
