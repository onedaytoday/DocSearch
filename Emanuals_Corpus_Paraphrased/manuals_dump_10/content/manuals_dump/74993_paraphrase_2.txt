### Oven Usage Instructions

#### Preheating
For optimal cooking results, preheat the oven before placing food inside. Ensure that the heat is applied evenly to the food by positioning it centrally on the designated rack, which should be directly below the heating element.

### Using the Second Oven
The second oven is heated from the upper element and is ideal for baking cakes and other dishes. Set the temperature to a recommended 100°C. Make sure to utilize the specific model instructions (D2160-1G) when operating this oven.

#### General Tips
- Ensure the oven reaches the desired temperature before cooking begins.
- Keep the internal light on while cooking for visibility.
- Dishes should not touch the oven walls or interfere with ventilation to prevent overheating and ensure even cooking.

### Cooking in the Main Fan Oven
The fan oven promotes even cooking by circulating hot air. Always preheat the oven before starting, as it helps achieve recommended cooking temperatures more efficiently.

#### Using Shelves
Install the oven shelves so they are level and spaced appropriately, with wires aligned at the back for stability. Ensure dishes are positioned to allow for proper airflow.

#### Telescopic Runners (if applicable)
Ensure the runners are correctly positioned for smooth operation, enabling easy access to the food.

### Cooking Charts
Refer to the cooking chart for specific dishes and their appropriate temperatures and times. For accuracy, adjust the temperature by 20°C-25°C when necessary.

### Defrosting
Utilize the defrost function to thaw foods without using heat. This setting is beneficial for delicate items like cakes and cheesecakes. Follow the guidelines for safe defrosting to avoid bacterial growth.

### Meat Temperatures
Use a meat thermometer to ensure the meat reaches internal temperatures ranging from 60°C to 80°C, depending on the type.

### Food Preparation Tips
When purchasing food, choose the freshest items. Store perishable goods promptly and follow cooking instructions meticulously to ensure they are handled safely throughout the cooking and reheating process.

### Care and Cleaning
Always allow the cooling fan to run until the oven has cooled before disconnecting power. Use non-abrasive cleaners for both the interior and exterior surfaces of the oven to avoid damage.

#### Cleaning Glass Panels
Use appropriate cleaning materials designed for glass to maintain visibility. If the glass becomes chipped or scratched, consider consulting a professional for repair.
