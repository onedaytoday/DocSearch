### Assembly Instructions

1. **Positioning the Cooker**: Begin by measuring from the front of the cooker to the back and from the top to the intended installation location. Adjust the height of the cooker to align with the designated shelf.

2. **Adjusting the Height**: Use the controls at the front of the cooker to adjust the height by turning them either clockwise or counterclockwise. The wheels are attached to screws that are accessible from the front of the plinth. To lower the unit, turn the screws in a counterclockwise direction.

3. **Fitting the Plinth**: Ensure that the plinth fits snugly against the cooker, securing it with the provided screws.

### Electrical Connections

**Warning**: Ensure the cooker is properly earthed! Access the internal wiring by removing the designated screw.
