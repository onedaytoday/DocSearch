**Safety Precautions:**

1. **Grounding Requirements:** To prevent serious injury, fire, or electric shock, ensure the washer is properly grounded. Follow the grounding instructions in this manual.

2. **Chemical Use:** Do not mix bleach with other household cleaning products, as this can cause hazardous reactions that may lead to serious injury or death.

3. **Children's Safety:** Keep children away from the washer when unpacking. They should not play near or with the washer, as it can create an airtight chamber that poses suffocation risks.

3. **Using Detergents:** Use the recommended amounts of detergent and bleach. Overloading or reducing amounts can diminish cleaning effectiveness.

4. **Drawer Operation:**
   - **Opening and Closing:** Pull the dispenser drawer to the right to add laundry products. Ensure it closes fully after use.
   - **Bleach Application:** Add the correct amount of liquid bleach, and avoid pouring it directly onto clothes to prevent damage.

### Cleaning and Maintenance Instructions for the Washer

To maintain the washer, follow these cleaning guidelines: 

1. **Cleaning After Use**: Wipe the exterior with a cloth after every use and clean the inside once a month or as needed. If there is a build-up in the hoses, turn off the water supply.
2. **Stain Removal**: For any stains, use a solution of bleach mixed with water, ensuring the washer is empty before cleaning. Make sure to rinse thoroughly afterward.
3. **Cleaning Recesses**: To clean the recesses, apply bleach carefully and wipe away any residue.
4. **Check for Blockages**: Occasionally inspect hoses for clogs and clean them if necessary. 

### Troubleshooting Noises

If the washer produces unusual noises, diagnose the following potential issues:

- **Clicking or Clanking Sounds**: This may indicate a problem with the load distribution; stop the washer and redistribute the items evenly.
- **Overheating**: If the washer becomes overheated, it will shut off automatically to prevent damage.

### Water Supply Considerations

- Ensure that all water supply hoses are correctly connected and provide adequate pressure. Adjust the supply valves clockwise if necessary.
