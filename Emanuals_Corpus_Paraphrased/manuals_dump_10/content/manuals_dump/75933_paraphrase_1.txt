Here’s a paraphrase of the provided text in a more technical, yet natural manner:

To maintain optimal performance, use a suitable cleaner and ensure proper defrosting procedures to prevent electric shock hazards. Disconnect the unit from the power supply before cleaning any components, including the interior and exterior surfaces, using a cloth. It is essential to allow food items to cool adequately before placing them back, particularly after defrosting.

For troubleshooting, refer to the Service Force instructions if you notice malfunctions related to food preservation or temperature control. If the appliance’s indicator lights are malfunctioning, check the thermostat settings and adjust as necessary.

To switch off the light, disconnect the power supply and follow the instructions to remove the light cover using a screwdriver. Be cautious of potential risks due to frost build-up, and ensure that your device adheres to EU regulations for electrical safety.
