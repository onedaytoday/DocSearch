### Storage Water Heater Installation Guidelines

**Models**: R/RN, EWH-R/RN, EWH-SL/SLN, EWH-S/SN (US, MA)

#### Installation Overview
This heater comes with essential components for initial installation and operation. It is crucial to adhere to the manufacturer's guidelines and local regulations during setup.

#### Wall Mounting Procedure
Ensure proper mounting with screws supplied with the heater.

#### Location Recommendations
The heater can be installed either horizontally (EWH-SL/SLN and EWH-R/RN) or vertically in any area of the house that is free from frost. The installation location must allow for easy access to the outlet below for maintenance purposes. Mark the input and output connections clearly during installation.

#### Hydraulic Installation
Connect the heater to the water supply. Ensure the input and output connections are made correctly. The heater operates on the principle that water expands when heated, necessitating a return flow for cold water. The RN and SL models allow for this expansion to prevent issues with the cold-water feed.

**Operational Setup**: The outlet connector can be adjusted either clockwise or counterclockwise as needed. Check the flow to confirm it meets specifications. If a pressure-reducing valve is fitted, it should be set correctly to avoid supply issues.

#### Electrical Installation
Connect the heater to a power supply, ensuring it is earthed properly. Installation of the heater is straightforward but must comply with standard electrical practices, particularly in bathrooms where certain restrictions apply.

#### Prohibited Volume
Maintain a safe distance from bathtubs, showers, and any electrical switches. Avoid placing the heater in proximity to water sources to prevent electrical hazards.

#### Operational Notes
Monitor the heater's status; indicator lights will flash when the heating element activates. The thermostat controls the heating process efficiently, allowing for variable temperature settings.

#### Maintenance
Clean the heater with a cloth. After the warranty period, regular servicing may be required to ensure optimal performance. Components may wear over time, necessitating inspection.

#### Safety and Compliance
Ensure all components, such as switches and earthing mechanisms, comply with relevant standards. The heater features built-in safety systems to mitigate risks associated with overheating.

#### Manufacturer's Discretion
The manufacturer reserves the right to change product specifications without prior notice.
