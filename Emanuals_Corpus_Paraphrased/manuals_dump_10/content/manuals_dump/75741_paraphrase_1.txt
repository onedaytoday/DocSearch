### COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC Functions

The **COOLMATIC** function activates cooling for stored items and is engaged by pressing the COOLMATIC button. The corresponding yellow indicator light illuminates, showing that the desired cooling level has been selected. The **FROSTMATIC** function, on the other hand, helps quickly freeze fresh food products while safeguarding previously frozen items. This function can be manually turned on by pressing the FROSTMATIC button, which also activates its yellow light.

To switch off either function, press and hold the ON/OFF buttons for a few seconds. An automatic countdown initiates, and once it reaches zero, the appliance will turn off. Be cautious of accidentally closing doors, as this may lead to temperature changes and spoilage. It is essential to empty and clean the appliance regularly to avoid mold and maintain its efficiency.

### Adjustable Shelving and Food Storage

The shelves can be adjusted in height to accommodate various bottle sizes. To remove a bottle, pull it upward from the front. It is crucial to store food on the correct shelves: keep meat and other perishables on the lower shelves, ideally maintaining a temperature of below 0°C. Always cover food items to prevent contamination from other products.

### Warning Signals

The appliance features a warning system that alerts if temperatures are too high. If a warning tone sounds, adjust the position of the food or switch off the warning by pressing the WARNING OFF button. If temperatures exceed safe limits, the warning system will disengage automatically once conditions improve.

### Defrosting

Regular defrosting of the appliance is necessary to maintain optimal performance. It is recommended to defrost at least once a year or more frequently if ice buildup is significant. Ensure that the appliance is unplugged before beginning the defrosting process to avoid electrical hazards. 

### Maintenance and Cleaning

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the power supply. Use appropriate cleaning products and avoid those containing bleach or other harsh chemicals that can damage surfaces. The lighting within the appliance should also be maintained carefully; replace bulbs as needed, ensuring the power is off during the process.

### Correcting Malfunctions

In the event of a malfunction, refer to the troubleshooting section of the user manual for potential solutions. For complex issues, contact Service Force for professional assistance. Always prioritize safety, and do not attempt repairs beyond basic maintenance without the necessary expertise.
