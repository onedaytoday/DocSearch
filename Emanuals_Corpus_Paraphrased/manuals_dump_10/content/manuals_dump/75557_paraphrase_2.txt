### Instructions for Using the Cooking Oven

#### Shelf Setup and Safety
When cooking with multiple cake layers, ensure that shelves are positioned correctly to allow even heat circulation. For optimal results, use at least four layers, placing them directly on the shelves (A through F). It's crucial to engage the stop-locks on each shelf, ensuring they are secured in place. Be cautious not to burn yourself when setting up the shelves, particularly the lowest one (A), which should be at least a few inches from the bottom of the oven.

#### Preheating and Cooking
Preheating is essential for baking cakes, cookies, and breads. The oven will automatically display the preheating status. Once the desired temperature is reached, you can begin cooking by selecting the appropriate settings. For foods such as thick meats, consider using the LO or HI settings during the roasting process to ensure thorough cooking without over-browning. 

#### Timer and Clock Functions
To set the kitchen timer, touch the KITCHEN TIMER ON/OFF button. The timer will display the elapsed time. For clock adjustments, make sure it’s correctly set; you can turn it off or modify it by repeatedly touching the CLOCK button. If the timer or clock does not respond, ensure that the corresponding buttons are pressed correctly.

#### Self-Cleaning Feature
The oven includes a self-cleaning function, which must be utilized according to instructions to ensure proper operation. Ensure that the self-cleaning process is completed, and then touch CLEAR/OFF to reset for the next use. The light will indicate when the oven is in self-cleaning mode and will turn off once the process is complete.

#### Cooking Performance and Adjustments
If you notice irregular cooking results, it may indicate that the thermostat needs calibration. Use appropriate thermometers for accurate measurements. Be aware that higher-fat foods may affect cooking performance. If you require adjustments for low-fat or high-fat products, consult the user guide for the correct settings.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize your oven’s capabilities for a range of cooking tasks.

The self-cleaning feature on www.GEAppliances.com facilitates the cleaning of heavy cookware and shelves. Note that the shelves must be cleaned manually if not suitable for self-cleaning. Utilize mild detergents or cleansers as specified in the cleaning section. Ensure the latch is engaged and allow the oven to cool before activating the SELF CLEAN function. The self-cleaning cycle typically requires several hours, and you can start it by touching START/ON. A countdown timer will appear, ensuring the oven remains safe and intact. If any components are damaged or frayed, they should be replaced immediately.

For manual cleaning, the clock will indicate the time remaining. To initiate self-cleaning, press the SELF CLEAN button and set the desired time. If you need to stop the cleaning process, press CLEAR/OFF. Clean shelves with a damp cloth, avoiding abrasive materials that could harm the finish. Be cautious around hot surfaces and ensure items are cool before handling.

While self-cleaning, the unit will not cook. To maintain safety, the door will remain locked until the cycle completes and the unit cools down sufficiently. Always refer to the instructions for troubleshooting or cleaning tips on www.GEAppliances.com, and avoid using harsh chemicals that could damage surfaces.

For cleaning the light cover, allow it to cool, then unscrew and clean. Ensure the cover fits securely and the units are free of grease to prevent fire hazards. If any issues arise, consult the troubleshooting section related to the oven's thermostat and electrical connections to ensure proper function.

### Troubleshooting and Service Instructions

**Troubleshooting Guide for Consumers**

To initiate troubleshooting, press the CLEAR/OFF button. If the self-cleaning function is engaged, verify the latch is secured.
