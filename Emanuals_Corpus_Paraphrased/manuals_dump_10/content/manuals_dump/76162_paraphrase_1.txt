### INSTALLATION OF THE COOKER HOOD

**Positioning the Cooker Hood**  
When installing the cooker hood on the wall, ensure it is positioned at the appropriate height above the cooking surface, as specified in the supplied manual. Refer to the indicated dimensions (X height of the section provided) to maintain the correct distance from the back wall. 

**Splashback (Optional)**  
If using a splashback, it should be positioned at both the top and height specified in the installation instructions. Ensure that the mounting for the splashback aligns correctly with the base of the cooker hood. Using the supplied screws, secure the splashback to the wall. If the wall is hollow or unsuitable for direct mounting, use the appropriate screws for structural support.

**Cooker Hood Extraction (Ducted)**  
For optimal performance, the cooker hood should be installed in ducted mode, using ducting purchased or customized for your setup. Ensure compliance with British standards or DIN 4102-B1. The ducting should be connected to the top of the hood as demonstrated in the guidelines. Utilize the most direct path for ducting to enhance performance while minimizing bends, which could impair airflow. 

If connecting to heating appliances, ensure that the ducting is sealed properly to prevent any leaks. 

**Activated Charcoal Filter**  
For environments that require filtering, install the activated charcoal filter and connect it to the outlet as per the installation instructions. Make sure that the chimney sections fit together seamlessly and are properly secured using the provided screws.
