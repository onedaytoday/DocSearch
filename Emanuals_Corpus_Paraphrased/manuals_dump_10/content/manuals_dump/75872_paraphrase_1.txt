#### Troubleshooting

A troubleshooting chart is provided for diagnosing common issues. Specific attention should be paid to the thermistor readings and connections. If the system exhibits fault codes (e.g., "E" indicates a potential thermistor issue), immediate inspection and potential replacement of the affected components are advised.

#### Recovery and Recycling

Adhere to EPA guidelines for refrigerant recovery and recycling, both for in-warranty and out-of-warranty repairs. Testing, charging, and handling of sealed systems must be performed with care to prevent overheating and damage. Always utilize approved safety standards, including wearing safety glasses and having a fire extinguisher available.

#### Handling Procedures

When working with the refrigerant system, ensure cleanliness and avoid contamination. Use appropriate cleaning materials and handle the system with care to maintain integrity. Follow guidelines for proper charging and testing to avoid overcharging, which could result in system failure.

### Teardown Instructions

#### Teardown of the Cover Plate
1. **Remove the Cover Plate**: Locate the four screws at the back of the cover plate. While holding the cover securely, use one hand to reach for the screws. Use a screwdriver to unscrew the plate, allowing partial movement away from the back to free it from the housing.
2. **Disconnect the Cover**: Detach the cover by disconnecting the screws, ensuring it is entirely removed from the main assembly. 

#### Switch Removal
1. **Locate the Switch**: The switch is mounted on the cover. To remove it, gently pull the leads from the back of the switch, then press the switch through the cover.

#### Housing Disassembly
1. **Remove Housing**: The housing has four screws securing the cover. After disconnecting the leads, carefully release the four latches while pulling it from the front. This will free the housing from the cover.
2. **Remove Assembly**: Detach the screws from the mounting bracket, allowing removal of the bracket from the assembly.

#### Defrost Thermostat Procedure
1. **Thermostat Removal**: To detach the defrost thermostat, remove it from its housing and disconnect the leads from the harness.
  
#### Defrost Heater Procedure
1. **Heater Removal**: Detach the defrost heater by disconnecting its leads. Release the heater from its mounting area and remove any styrofoam insulation attached.

#### Cord and Grounding Procedure
1. **Cord Removal**: Unscrew the four screws holding the cord shield to its mounting. Check all ground wires and ensure proper disconnection. 

#### Recovery and Reassembly
- **Recovery Process**: Always use EPA recovery protocols when handling sealed components and ensure that no refrigerant is released into the atmosphere.
- **Reassembly Instructions**: Follow the provided assembly instructions diligently. Ensure that all wiring and components are securely reconnected and that the gadget is charged as per guidelines.

### Troubleshooting Section

1. **Temperature Issues**: If the storage temperature is warmer or colder than expected, check the amount and placement of food, ensure the door seals are functioning correctly, and the unit is not overloaded.

2. **Noise Concerns**: Listen for unusual sounds like cracking or popping when the unit operates. These could be indicative of interior frost build-up or other internal issues.

3. **Temperature Readings**: To troubleshoot temperature discrepancies, disconnect the thermostat and heater leads. Measure the readings and compare them to expected values to identify defective components.

4. **General Troubleshooting**: If the indicator light behaves unusually or the power supply is inconsistent, check the connections and consider possible defects in switches or the wiring harness.

### Notes
- **Refer to the Thermistor Chart** for specific temperature adjustments based on the model.
- Ensure that during the whole process, appropriate safety protocols are followed for both handling and disposal of refrigeration units.

### Important Safety Instructions

**Cautionary Measures**  
This section outlines critical safety guidelines related to the use of the appliance. **WARNING:** Non-compliance with the installation, maintenance, and safety instructions provided in this service manual can lead to property damage or personal injury, and Electrolux will not be held liable.

To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury while using your refrigerator/freezer, adhere to the following basic safety precautions:

1. **Read All Instructions:** Review all instructions thoroughly before operating the appliance.
2. **Disconnect Power:** Ensure that electric power to the refrigerator/freezer is disconnected prior to any service or installation.
3. **Avoid Flammable Materials:** Do not store or use combustible, flammable, or explosive liquids (e.g., gasoline) near this or any appliance to prevent possible fire or explosion.
4. **Use Proper Electrical Outlets:** The appliance comes with a three-prong grounding plug for electrical shock protection. Connect it solely to a dedicated, grounded outlet. If only a two-prong outlet is available, have it replaced with a properly grounded three-prong outlet.
5. **Do Not Alter the Plug:** Under no circumstances should you cut or remove the grounding prong from the power cord, nor should you use an adapter or extension cord. Avoid using any frayed or damaged power cords.
6. **GFI Not Recommended:** The use of Ground Fault Interrupters (GFIs) is discouraged. Do not install or operate a damaged appliance. If you receive a damaged unit, contact your dealer or builder immediately.
7. **Professional Installation Required:** The refrigerator/freezer must be installed by a qualified technician per these instructions. The installer should inform the customer of the power plug's location for easy access to disconnect power when required.
8. **Follow Manufacturer Guidelines:** Service and repairs should only be performed based on the literature provided with the appliance. All other services should be conducted by a qualified technician.

**Child Safety Measures**  
Immediately dispose of packaging materials like cartons and plastic bags once unpacked to prevent potential hazards for children. Items like covered cartons may become airtight and pose suffocation risks. Always remove, or at least secure, the door/lid of the refrigerator/freezer when not in use, regardless of your plans for disposing of it. Many communities mandate this safety procedure. 

**Old Appliance Disposal**  
If you are discarding an old refrigerator or freezer, follow these instructions to prevent accidents: 

- Remove the door/lid.
- Keep shelves in place to deter children from climbing inside.
- Have a qualified technician safely remove the refrigerant.

**Installation Guidelines**  
Ensure the appliance is installed in a location that meets grounding requirements and avoids exposure to extreme temperatures (below 10°F / -12°C). Clear any obstructions around the unit to allow for proper air circulation and heat dissipation. 

**Electrical Safety Precautions**  
Always connect the appliance to a properly grounded outlet. Avoid the use of extension cords or adapter plugs, as they may affect the appliance's performance and void the warranty. To unplug, grasp the plug firmly and pull straight out without tugging on the cord.

**Installation Procedure**  
Follow the installation instructions carefully. Disconnect the power supply and remove the back cover as needed for assembly. Use the appropriate tools to attach screws and mount necessary components securely.
