### MAN-DRBUIG DC 

The DC power supply meets technical specifications in accordance with EN60950 or corresponding directives. It is essential that the AC supply, if connected, is isolated properly before enabling any protective features. Furthermore, compliance with EN60742 is necessary. Ideally, the DC supply should be a single-phase rectified unit configured per the specifications mentioned. The unit should be installed in close proximity to the amplifier for optimal performance. Care should be taken regarding high-inertia loads; the supply must handle these effectively, particularly during amplifier operation.

### MAN-DRBUIG Thermal Management

Heat dissipation from the device must be managed to ensure that it does not exceed approximately the designated temperature limits of the assembly. Thermal resistance is specified as C/W, with time constants relating to thermal shutdown as illustrated in the accompanying graph. By monitoring temperature parameters, appropriate cooling strategies can be established, particularly when the component temperature rises and approaches critical thresholds.

### MAN-DRBUIG Input Command

The system’s operating input voltage is specified, and it is critical that input resistors conform to organizational standards to allow for correct operating voltages. The continuous input levels must be maintained within the specifications for the ECLC and ECLP parameters. Inputs exceeding the threshold values above 3.75V are restricted and must be managed accordingly to prevent damage.

### MAN-DRBUIG ECLC Configuration

The output parameters for the ECLC and ECLRET are defined, including restrictions on permissible voltage levels. The internal design must ensure that, at voltages exceeding 3.75V, the system operates within safe parameters.

### MAN-DRBUIG Operational Characteristics

Operational characteristics include thresholds for short circuit protection, details on amplifier signals, and indication systems. Functionality options for the device outline various operational statuses, such as “Amplifier OK” and short protection mechanisms.

### MAN-DRBUIG Specifications Overview

#### A.1 General Specifications
- Units: VDC specifications are outlined for supply efficiency and PCB mounting.

#### A.2 Environmental Specifications
- Operating temperature ranges are specified along with shock and humidity tolerances.

#### A.3 Quality and Compliance Standards
- Quality specifications adhere to ISO standards and military specifications (e.g., MIL-STD-704). EMC compatibility is ensured per EN55011 with additional guidelines provided for product integrity, including insulation and environmental compliance.

**Additional Notes:** Compliance with WEEE and RoHS directives is stipulated, necessitating proper disposal procedures for out-of-service units.
