Cakes typically bake at temperatures ranging from 175°C to 250°C. The dough should be fully cooked prior to garnishing to ensure the right consistency and prevent unnecessary cooking time. It’s important to manage the cooking methods depending on the type of cake. For instance, white meat is best cooked at lower temperatures, while red meat requires a higher heat to avoid overcooking.

During cooking, it is essential to pay attention to the positioning of the trays. Shelves should be placed appropriately, ensuring that meat does not drip onto other foods, which may alter their cooking process. Proper use of steam and heat should be monitored to promote even roasting without excessive moisture that could hinder the cooking process. 

Warning: Ensure that food items are covered appropriately during cooking and do not obstruct the heating elements, maintaining proper airflow in the cooking cavity. Before cleaning, always turn off the unit and allow it to cool down. Clean the surfaces with a suitable cloth or sponge, avoiding abrasive materials that could damage the heat-reflecting coatings.

To clean the internal components, take care to remove them correctly, ensuring that they are locked back into place once cleaned. Any signs of damage like scratches or cracks should be reported to authorized service personnel for repair. 

When replacing shelves or lighting components, adhere strictly to the specified voltage and wattage requirements. Always ensure the power supply is secured before commencing any cleaning or maintenance work. 

Refer to the technical specifications for cavity height and heating capabilities, along with guidance for installation conforming to local regulations. If encountered with any operational issues, follow the troubleshooting sections outlined in the manual, or contact technical support for assistance.
