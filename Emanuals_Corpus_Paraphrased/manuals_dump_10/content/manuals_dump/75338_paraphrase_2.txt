When preparing food, the thickness and type of ingredients should be considered for proper cooking. Thorough cooking minimizes splashing and ensures even heat distribution. For example, when toasting bread, preheat the appliance to a high temperature and arrange the bread centrally on the top shelf. The shelves are numbered from the top down. Ensure at least an inch of space around the food for optimal heat circulation, which also aids in cleaning.

Use enamelware or heavy dishes to promote browning, while polished surfaces may reduce cooking times. Refer to the cooking chart for precise instructions, especially for batch cooking with cakes and similar items, ensuring adequate spacing for even heat exposure. When defrosting, monitor the process closely as cooler items take longer; small or minced cuts should usually thaw in hours, while larger pieces may need more. Once defrosted, cook food immediately.

For service-related issues, common problems and solutions include: if the appliance isn’t functioning, allow it to cool for a few hours and ensure the timer is correctly set. Mechanical issues may require contacting customer support. Always check the electricity supply and switches.

To maintain even cooking, ensure that the appliance is functioning properly, and verify that all shelves are positioned correctly. If the indicator light is malfunctioning, consider replacing it. Follow cleaning guidelines carefully, avoiding harsh chemicals on painted or coated finishes.

To clean the outer surface, use mild detergents suitable for the specific finish. If deterioration occurs, consider professional service. To access internal areas for cleaning, follow the provided steps carefully, ensuring that all screws are properly secured afterward.

Safety instructions included adhere to directives such as Council Directive 73/23/EEC and EMC Directive 89/336/EEC. The appliance must be properly earthed to prevent electrical hazards. Basic wiring practices make it safe to operate, hence it’s crucial that connections are secure and comply with recommended standards.

Ensure the installation is performed according to the prescribed specifications, with appropriate grounding. The operating instructions must be followed to maintain safety and performance.

Connecting the appliance should involve careful insulation and connection of wires as detailed in the guidelines, reducing the risk of fouling. Regular checking of the electrical grounding ensures safe operation.
