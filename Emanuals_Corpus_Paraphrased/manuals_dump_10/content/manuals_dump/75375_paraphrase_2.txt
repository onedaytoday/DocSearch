### Main Oven Operations

**Main Fan Oven Preheating**  
To achieve optimal cooking temperatures, preheating the main oven is essential. Without preheating, reaching the recommended cooking temperatures may not be possible. Always preheat the oven before cooking.

**Cooking Temperatures**  
Adhere to the recommended temperature chart for cooking. If needed, reduce temperatures by 20°C to 25°C for batch baking. 

**Using the Main Oven**  
Switch on the oven; the light will illuminate when the oven is in operation. Monitor the cooling fan; it will cycle on and off during cooking.

**Adjusting Oven Shelves**  
Shelves can be positioned from the bottom upwards and should be aligned straight with the back of the oven. Proper placement ensures even cooking.

**Cooking Tips**  
- When using multiple shelves, space items correctly to allow heat circulation, enhancing cooking and browning.  
- Use enamelware or heavy-duty dishes for improved browning. Avoid placing food directly on the oven floor.  
- If browning is excessive, lower the temperature slightly as indicated in the cooking chart.

### Oven Cooking Chart  
Adjustments can be made for each type of food. Increase temperatures if necessary, typically by an additional 10°C.

**Food Temperature (°C) Location**  
- Bread: Follow specific instructions.  
- Custard: Place according to guidelines.  
- Eclairs/Profiteroles: Position correctly for optimal results.

### Roasting Chart  
Increase roasting temperatures as required, and monitor the internal temperatures of meat for optimal cooking.

**Internal Temperatures for Roasting Meat:**  
- 50-60°C  
- 60-70°C  
- 70-80°C  

### Defrost Feature  
This feature is ideal for defrosting foods, especially those with frostings or icings. Keep in mind that some foods require different periods to thaw.

**Defrosting Tips**  
Monitor the food during the defrosting process, as the duration may vary based on thickness. Cook meat immediately after thawing to prevent bacterial growth.

### Care and Cleaning  
Ensure the oven cools before cleaning it. Use non-corrosive cleaners to avoid damaging finishes, and adhere to the recommended cleaning materials.

**Cleaning Instructions**  
- Exterior cleaning should avoid abrasive pads and harsh chemicals.  
- Clean control knobs and handles carefully to maintain surface finishes.  
- For inside cleaning, follow specific guidelines to protect coatings.

**Stayclean Surfaces**  
These surfaces can be manually cleaned; avoid products that may damage the Stayclean layer.

**Removing Wirework Runners**  
Detach wire runners from the cavity for easier cleaning.

### Between the Glass Panels
