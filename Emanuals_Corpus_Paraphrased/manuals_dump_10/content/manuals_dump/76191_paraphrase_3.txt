**Overview of Appliance Use**
This appliance is designed for extraction and cleaning, specifically for grease removal. It includes a mounted light and a charcoal filter. Users should be aware that the device may overheat if the grease filter is dirty, increasing the risk of self-ignition and fire hazards. To prevent these issues, it is recommended to ensure the grease filters are clean and to turn off the appliance when not in use. Special care should be taken around children or vulnerable individuals, as they should be warned against operating the appliance improperly.

**Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)**
This appliance must be disposed of and recycled in accordance with WEEE regulations. Please consult local household services regarding recycling details.

**Installation Guidelines**
If there are any existing ducts or connections through walls, ensure they are appropriately reduced for efficient operation. The appliance must connect to a compatible gas outlet and comply with local building regulations.

**Assembly Instructions**
Use only the provided materials and follow the instructions carefully to ensure optimal performance. Connect hoses directly to the designated outlets, minimizing bends to prevent efficiency loss.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**
Regular cleaning of the grease filter and housing is essential. Use cloths and non-abrasive cleaning products, avoiding bleach. If the filters are dishwasher safe, set the dishwasher to a high-temperature cycle (minimum 65Â°C) for effective grease removal.
