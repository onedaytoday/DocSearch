The Bridge, located at the front, is designed for use with cookware. When cooking, ensure the cookware is positioned correctly on each section of the Bridge. Operate the Bridge by adjusting the heat settings; both inner and outer sections generate heat simultaneously. You can switch between these settings as needed. Adjust the cookware by turning it clockwise or counterclockwise to set appropriate temperatures. The controls, labeled HI, MED, and LO, will indicate the selected heat. After cooking, switch off the heat and allow the cookware to cool down. It’s crucial that they cool sufficiently to prevent burns.

The Warming function is intended for keeping cooked foods like stews and breads at optimal temperatures. It's advisable to cover foods for even heating and ease of cleaning. When using the Warming function, ensure the cookware is appropriate for this setting. The Warming light will turn on during operation and will indicate when the food is sufficiently heated.

Different types of cookware affect cooking performance, so follow provided instructions for best results. Aluminum heats quickly but can scratch easily; copper is efficient, while stainless steel is durable and heats well. Cast iron reaches high temperatures steadily, but porcelain-enamel cookware should be used cautiously to avoid scratching.

The Warming feature allows for versatility in food heating. It’s recommended to use a cover for foods being warmed for effective heating and cleanliness. The settings (HI, MED, LO) facilitate preheating times and indicate when the food is ready. 

Before using the oven, read the instructions thoroughly to ensure proper operation, including functions like SPEED CLEAN and BAKE. Each function has specific controls for adjusting time and temperature. To set the clock, follow the guidelines clearly provided.

The TIMER ON/OFF and CLEAN features can operate continuously or for a fixed hour as needed. To activate, simply press the appropriate buttons, and the display will guide you through settings.

If you experience any operational malfunctions, the display will show error codes like "PF". To clear and reset, follow the instructions for clock adjustments or sound operations as detailed.

When utilizing the BAKE function, temperatures can be adjusted between 170°F and 550°F, ensuring precise cooking for a variety of food items.

The BAKE and BAKE TIME functions control the cooking duration. To initiate cooking and automatically power off afterward, set the temperature to 350°F and place the food in the appropriate rack(s). Press "BAKE" to begin; "BAKE" will flash followed by pressing "TIMED" to set the desired cooking hours, after which both "TIMED" and "BAKE" will display. Once cooking has started, a sound will signal when it is finished. To turn off, press the relevant button for a few seconds.

Note: For clock settings exceeding one hour, follow specific instructions for setting cooking times.

Always ensure proper heat coverage when cooking, especially when using temperatures up to 550°F. Maintain the oven door closed during preheating. In cases of fire, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; use a fire extinguisher instead. Avoid covering any heating elements or grease while cooking.

For Convection Cooking: Use the "CONV BAKE" function to utilize circulating heat effectively. Set to 350°F and press the "CONV BAKE" button. This function optimizes cooking time while ensuring even heat distribution.

For Convection Roasting: Activate by pressing "CONV" to ensure proper cooking of meats and poultry. Make sure to avoid contact between food and any grease catchers during the process to enhance browning.

The "CONV CONVERT" feature allows for adjustment in cooking time when switching to Convection settings.

To save your preferred cooking settings, use the FAVORITE SETTING function. Press "BAKE," and the setting will be recorded. To recall it, press "BAKE" again within a few seconds, and the preset heating will be activated.

During the Sabbath, the BAKE TIME and START TIME functions can be adjusted to ensure compliance. The settings will remain active for the designated duration and automatically shut off at the end of cooking.

Important notes: Avoid disruptions to operations, and ensure all settings are correctly inputted. The warming function must not be utilized during self-cleaning cycles.

For maintenance, ensure the warming shield is securely attached. Use the hex-head screw and ratchet for installation, and be cautious to avoid injury during the cleaning process.

This revised version maintains the original information but presents it in a clearer and more structured manner.

The Self-Cleaning feature should not be interfered with while in operation. Avoid cleaning the walls, racks, or any other parts of the oven during this process. High temperatures are used to burn off food residues, reducing them to ash, which can be easily wiped away. Do not use any cleaner or protective coating inside the Self-Cleaning chamber, and avoid forcing the door open while it is locked. The chamber will reach very high temperatures, so exercise caution.

To initiate the Self-Cleaning cycle, ensure that the oven door is closed and the clock is set correctly. You can choose a cleaning duration of 2, 3, or 4 hours depending on the level of buildup. Follow the prompts, and once the cleaning is complete, the door will remain locked until the oven has cooled down. 

When the process is finished, if you need to clean the oven again, wait until it cools. If you encounter any issues, press the necessary buttons as described in the instructions to reset the cycle.

To avoid damaging various parts of the appliance, use only recommended cleaning products that are safe for ovens, and do not scrub surfaces that could be scratched. For stubborn grime, you can use a cloth or non-scratch scouring pads, taking care not to use highly abrasive cleaners or surfaces.

Periodically check the oven's internal electrical systems via the ESEC display. In case of an error, follow the indicated troubleshooting steps to reset the system. Always adhere to safety measures while handling the oven, especially when engaged in cleaning processes.

**POTENTIAL CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS FOR OCCURRENCE OF EXCESSIVE LIGHT:**

If the control panel displays excessive light, the following factors may be responsible: self-cleaning issues, inadequate cleaning, or scratches on the surface. Ensure that you properly follow the instructions provided for the specific control settings. 

For optimal results, it’s essential to preheat the appliance and position the meat correctly to prevent curling. Grease buildup and the frequent use of dirty cookware can contribute to these issues. Make sure that the cooking environment is suitable and that the appliance has sufficiently preheated; otherwise, you may experience improper functioning of the controls.

When utilizing the self-cleaning feature, interruptions or excessive grease can hinder its effectiveness. Adhere closely to the cleaning instructions, especially when dealing with stubborn or baked-on residues. Using the recommended cleaning methods and materials is crucial to achieving satisfactory results. Avoid using rough cookware, as this can lead to scratches or damage.
