**Cooking Hints and Tips**  
When cooking, it's important to maintain a ‘high’ temperature around the food. For items like meats, ensure they are placed appropriately on the designated shelves and that cooking times are adjusted based on thickness. Utilize a thermal grilling chart for specific cooking times and temperatures. For example, items such as rashers, chops, and whole fish should be cooked at temperatures between 140°C to 220°C, ensuring they are evenly cooked throughout.

**Defrost Feature**  
The defrost function is designed to safely thaw food, particularly those with icings or frostings. To use it, adjust the Function Selector accordingly. It's crucial to monitor defrosting times, especially for meats, and to ensure that they are fully thawed before cooking. Always cook food immediately after defrosting to prevent bacterial growth.

**Care and Cleaning**  
Before beginning any cleaning, let the cooling fan operate to cool down the appliance. Avoid using bleach or abrasive materials that may damage the surface finishes. For the exterior, use a soft cloth and appropriate cleaners. Do not remove control knobs as this could lead to damage or safety issues.

For cleaning the oven and grill, reference the Stayclean features. These surfaces may need manual cleaning if heavily soiled. When handling wire racks or shelves, use care to avoid damage.

For cleaning the door, use gentle cleaners, and if addressing the space between the inner and outer glass, consult the cleaning instructions carefully to avoid disassembly problems.

When replacing the oven light bulb, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply and follow safety protocols during the replacement process.

**Troubleshooting**  
If problems occur, refer to the checklist to identify potential issues, including verifying connections and power status. Be aware of possible overheating and follow proper operation guidelines.
