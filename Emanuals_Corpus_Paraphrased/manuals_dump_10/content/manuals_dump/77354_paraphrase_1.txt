### Unshared Direct and Shared-or-Clustered Direct Configuration

For unshared systems, indicate the SP FC-AL IDs for SP A and SP B, along with their respective memory in megabytes. Specify the cache size in megabytes and kilobytes, as well as the RAID ID and its associated LUN IDs and RAID type. Additionally, complete the LUN Worksheet, documenting each LUN ID and corresponding information.

### Caching Considerations

When completing the LUN Worksheet, ensure the headers are filled out accurately, including RAID type and memory considerations. It is advisable to optimize SP memory allocation for read and write operations, including batch caching allowances. Aim to allocate about one-third of the total cache memory to write caching to balance performance effectively.

### RAID Group and LUN Assignments

Each LUN ID corresponds to a specific LUN within its assigned RAID Group. The RAID ID for the group should be noted, particularly the first assigned RAID Group ID. Indicate the total capacity in gigabytes, ensuring that the LUN does not exceed the RAID Group limits.

### User Considerations

If sharing resources across various applications, note the recommended RAID configurations for optimal performance. Clarify which SP (A or B) will manage each LUN, and ensure that the specified RAID type aligns with prior configurations.

### Next Steps

This chapter has provided guidelines on configuring LUNs and RAID settings. Once the worksheets are filled, proceed to the next chapter, which covers the mounting process for directories. For installations involving shared resources, ensure that secondary paths are correctly assigned.

### Summary of Configuration Steps

In summary, the RAID and LUN setup must address all parameters carefully, including memory assignments, cache configurations, and the specifics of the RAID group. Complete the worksheets for both unshared and shared environments, documenting all necessary IDs and types.

Here's a technical paraphrase of the provided text:

This document outlines the configuration of storage systems involving unshared and shared resources. It details the necessary information for each Storage Processor (SP), including specific identifiers such as SP A and SP B, memory allocations in megabytes, caching specifications, RAID IDs, and LUN (Logical Unit Number) details. Each LUN ID must be recorded accordingly.

You are required to specify whether the system uses Unshared Direct or Shared/Clustered Direct configurations. The respective SP FC-AL IDs need to be identified for each SP, which interconnects through dedicated switches. It is essential to note the overall memory capacity available for each SP, including any RAID-related memory allocations, ensuring effective memory distribution to enhance read/write operations.

The document guides users on how to complete the EMC LUN Worksheet, emphasizing the significance of properly annotating LUN IDs and RAID configurations. It specifies the hierarchy of LUN IDs within RAID Groups, and highlights the IDs necessary for operational connectivity through host bus adapters. 

The document also categorizes RAID types, such as RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-3, and RAID-5, explaining their capacity limits and performance characteristics. Performance trade-offs between shared and unshared configurations are discussed, notably the impact on I/O operations and cache integrity. 

For effective system performance, it is suggested to allocate memory appropriately and understand the implications of using different RAID strategies. Finally, it notates the need for reliable power supply setups, emphasizing the high availability of infrastructure components like the DPE and associated cabling considerations.

EMC's Navisphere software and associated caches facilitate communication between storage processors (SPs) and include a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring performance. The application integrates with HP CA Unicenter software, enabling high-availability implementations through its Application-Transparent (ATF) optional software. This allows for seamless connectivity to Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) via host-bus switches or directly to SPs.

Additionally, CDE software, which comes included with each host-bus connection, allows users to execute commands directly through the CLI (Command Line Interface) or the GUI. The Navisphere software supports TCP/IP and provides features for both unshared and shared configurations across various operating systems, including NT and UNIX.

The software enables users to manage shared or clustered environments effectively. Users will need to fill out worksheets detailing shared hostnames and operating software to document setups for different hosts, including their respective Navisphere configurations.

Ultimately, the documentation should capture whether each Navisphere installation is unshared or shared/clusterized, along with the specific type of software in use for accurate record-keeping and system management.
