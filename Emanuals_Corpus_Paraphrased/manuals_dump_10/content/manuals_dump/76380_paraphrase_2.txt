Sure! Here’s a paraphrased version:

There are several operational issues with the E40 model, indicated by a flashing light. Common problems include insufficient water supply, improper distribution, overheating, or unbalanced loads, which could trigger the security system. The E20, E10, and EF0 models also show a red flashing light when inactive, often due to an obstructed hose or improper closure. Users are advised to check the hoses and perform the necessary maintenance. 

Regarding technical specifications, the appliance adheres to CEE standards for interference and complies with the 2006/95/CE safety regulations to prevent malfunctions during transport. 

For drainage, ensure hoses are correctly attached and not overly stretched. The unit operates on a single-phase voltage system and should be properly earthed. Positioning is critical; respect the guidelines for optimal placement.

When recycling, appliances should be treated as household waste. Consult local recycling services to ensure proper disposal. 

Warranty coverage lasts for two years from the date of purchase and requires proof for any service. This warranty covers operational defects, excluding damages caused by misuse or third-party intervention.
