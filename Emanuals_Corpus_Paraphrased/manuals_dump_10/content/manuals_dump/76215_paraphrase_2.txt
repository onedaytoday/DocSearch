# Instruction Manual for Electrolux Premier Cooker Hood (EPHOOD UK)

Thank you for choosing this product. Please refer to this manual for effective use and guidance. For further assistance or information about Electrolux products, please contact customer service.

### Important Information
To ensure proper use, please read the safety instructions carefully. Adhere to local building regulations such as BS.6172, BS.5440, BS.6891, and BS.5482. The cooker hood must be installed at the recommended height to avoid overheating. If it overheats, turn it off and let it cool significantly.

### Safety Precautions
- **Child Safety**: Ensure that children do not operate the cooker hood without supervision.
- **Fire Risk**: Never leave the cooker hood unattended while in use or during cleaning, as it may overheat or catch fire.

### Operating Instructions
For optimal performance, ensure that the charcoal filter is fitted. The cooker hood extracts grease and smoke from cooking, dispersing it into the atmosphere. 

### Maintenance and Cleaning
- **Charcoal Filter**: Replace the charcoal filter every three months or when it no longer effectively absorbs odors. 
- **Synthetic Grease Filter**: Clean or replace the synthetic grease filter when it changes color or becomes saturated.
  
To remove/replacement, hold the charcoal filter securely while unscrewing. Use protective gear during cleaning; avoid using scouring pads or harsh cleaners.

### Troubleshooting
If the cooker hood is not functioning:
- Ensure it is properly connected to the power supply.
- Check the light bulb (220-240V, 40W, E14) if itâ€™s not working. Replacement bulbs are available from Service Force.
- For further assistance, contact Service Force directly.
