**Troubleshooting: Problem Diagnosis and Solutions**

When the switch is correctly turned on, the internal components may have blown, necessitating replacement by a service technician. If the DAB-50 does not find any DAB stations, ensure it is properly connected to the amplifier and that the amplifier is working correctly. If it is only finding DAB/FM stations, verify that the correct information is selected in the tuning section; this may require adjusting the CONTROL/TUNING setting. Ensure you are tuned to the desired station, as high sound levels may produce whistling or other unintended noises, indicating that adjustments are necessary.

For further assistance, refer to the technical specifications of the RF section, including standards such as DAB (III) and FM, as well as details regarding the LED backlight and SPDIF (IEC 60958) configurations.
