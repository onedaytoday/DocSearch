**Closing the Options at the End of the Program**

At the conclusion of the program, the three indicator lights will turn off automatically. An acoustic signal may sound depending on the settings used. To proceed, follow the instructions outlined below after completing the program. 

For optimal drying, only use cotton and synthetic materials. **Warning:** Items made from cotton may be dried, while adjustments should be made accordingly to ensure the drying process is effective. Select the relevant drying option based on the fabric type, and remember to empty the container as necessary. Choose between the cotton, synthetic, or wool drying settings based on your load. As products cool down during the process, maintain an even distribution of items to prevent creasing.

If on the drying sector, the three lights may flash, indicating various phases. Depending on the phase selected, you may need to switch the device off.

**Non-Stop Washing and Auto-Drying Program**

This program can handle both washing and drying for cotton and synthetic items. Adjust your selections as needed; overpacking the drum can hinder performance. Each fabric type should be sorted into categories such as towels, shirts, or rolling items for optimal processing.

During the cooling phase, the algorithm will ensure the fabric is treated gently. If using the non-stop function, follow the instructions to prevent blockage.

**Drying Recommendations**

Keep in mind that not all items are suitable for drying. For example, delicate fabrics and certain synthetics may be adversely affected. Ensure the hose is correctly attached and functioning. If the program cannot be completed due to power issues, consult the relevant authority for assistance. 

**Helpful Sorting Tips**

Organize your laundry into categories: whites, colors, and synthetics. Thoroughly check labels before washing, ensuring proper temperature and care. Items such as pillowcases may require special treatment, so follow specific instructions for each fabric type to prevent unwanted discoloration.

**Removing Stains**

For stubborn stains, treat fabrics accordingly before washing. Utilize recommended detergents and adhere to guidelines for pre-treatment, particularly where bleach may be involved, ensuring compatibility with colors.

**Washing and Drying Performance**

Detergents and additives must be selected based on the load: high-performance options for heavily soiled items and standard for lighter loads. Avoid overloading to maintain efficiency during the drying cycle.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

Regular cleaning of the machine components, including the dispenser drawer, is crucial. Follow guidelines to avoid buildup and ensure optimal performance. Additionally, always disconnect from power before performing maintenance or descaling to prevent hazards.
