The Over-the-Range Microwaves models EI30BM55H S, EI30BM55H W, EI30BM55H B, and EI30BM55H IQ-Touch feature intuitive IQ-Touch cooking options. These presets guide users in preparing commonly cooked dishes, minimizing guesswork for optimal results. 

Key features include a spacious cooking cavity, a turntable, LED cavity lighting, a clock, touch controls for defrosting and meal reheating, as well as customizable sound alerts. There are also soft-arc edges and options for charcoal or ducted installation. The models come with several specifications that may vary, including dimensions and electrical requirements.

When installing, the microwave must be mounted to both the upper cabinet and the wall, and it requires a grounded 120V outlet for safe operation. It is important to follow installation instructions for clearances and ducting, regardless of whether the microwave is a ducted or ductless model. Various installation kits are compatible with these microwaves (PN# MWFILKTSS, PN# MWFILKTWH, PN# MWFILKTBLK). 

Note that specifications may change, so it's essential to refer to the latest product documentation for accurate information.
