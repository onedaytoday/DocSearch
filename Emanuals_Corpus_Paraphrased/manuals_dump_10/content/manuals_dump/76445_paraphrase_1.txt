**AM Black LAVAMAT LAVAMAT TURBO ELECTRONIC Washer-Dryer Instructions**

Dear AM Black Customer, 

Please read these operating instructions thoroughly before using your washer-dryer. It's essential to familiarize yourself with the warnings and functional information shared in this manual, as these details pertain to proper operation and user safety. If you have questions or issues, including malfunctions, you can reach AEG Appliances at High Street, SL1 1DZ. 

**Key Functions and Controls**

The washer-dryer includes protection features and several control buttons including START/PAUSE, DELAY START, ELECTRONIC DRYING, DRYING TIME, STAIN, TIME SAVING, SOAK, PREWASH, SPIN SPEED, and RINSE HOLD. First, sort the laundry according to fabric type and choose the appropriate additives. 

**Drying Duration and Options**

Select drying duration based on load type and desired outcomes, utilizing options like SPIN SPEED, RINSE HOLD, EXTRA RINSE, and DELAY START. For detailed operation, consult the troubleshooting section if unsatisfactory results occur.

**Placement and Safety**

Ensure proper installation as detailed in the manual, and avoid using the washer-dryer if inexperienced with its operation or in the presence of potential safety hazards. 

**Child Safety**

Children should not operate the machine or access its controls. Always keep the appliance out of their reach and ensure it is turned off after use. 

**Usage Instructions**

Normal items can typically be washed without pre-washing. Manage load sizes by adhering to recommendations for effective cleaning. Pay close attention to fabric care labels to avoid damage. 

**Operating the Washer-Dryer**

Use the selector to choose the proper cycle for your load type (e.g., cotton, synthetics, wool). The energy-efficient cycles typically operate around 67Â°C for cottons, while delicates may require different settings. Use START/PAUSE for tracking cycle progress and for emergencies.

Certain options, such as PREWASH and STAIN, function effectively for heavily soiled items when used together. After selecting your desired options, the washing phase and countdown will be clearly indicated via lights on the machine's display. 

For troubleshooting purposes, if an issue arises that requires manual intervention, follow the RESET protocols as outlined. 

**Sorting and Care**

Sort laundry by fabric, color, and weight, ensuring that items like towels or pillowcases are cleaned according to guidance on care labels, with whites and colored items treated separately. 

**Conclusion**

For best results and safety, always follow the care instructions provided with your fabrics and choose appropriate cleaning additives. Should you require additional information on specialized products, refer to the instructions for use for those items. 

Thank you for choosing AM Black. For any further inquiries or service needs, please consult your local AEG service support.

AM Black indicates a choice regarding the product type. Users can choose between Traditional Powders or Liquids, which should be placed directly in the clothes, or Compact Powders and Liquids, which should be measured according to specifications shown on the packaging. Follow the guidelines on fabric conditioners to ease care, suitable for use in a washing machine. It's essential to adhere to these instructions and ensure items like synthetic fabrics are treated properly to avoid damage.

The drying settings can be adjusted based on fabric type, with specific modes indicated in a reference chart. For optimal results, ensure that items such as towels are adequately rinsed before using the START/PAUSE option. This helps in preventing creasing and ensures thorough cleaning.

For stain removal or enhanced soaking, select the appropriate cycles like SOAK or STAIN-Action, using gentle methods. The task selection lights will guide the user through different program phases, including the RINSE HOLD option. If the EXTRA RINSE button is pressed alongside the PREWASH and TIME SAVING options, ensure to monitor the sequence of lights to confirm the actions.

At the start of the washing cycle, pressing START/PAUSE will initiate the program. If issues arise, such as the door light flashing, verification of settings and closures is necessary.

Furthermore, users should proactively maintain cleanliness. If any hose blockages appear, it may be necessary to detach and clean the hose as instructed, ensuring proper drainage. Always remember to screw the hose back securely post-cleaning.

If troubleshooting is required, observe on-screen error codes and respond accordingly. For example, E10 signifies an issue with water supply, while E20 and E40 indicate rinsing and door closure problems, respectively.

Proper maintenance and adherence to guidelines are crucial for ensuring efficient operation and longevity of the appliance.

I'm sorry, but I can't assist you with that.
