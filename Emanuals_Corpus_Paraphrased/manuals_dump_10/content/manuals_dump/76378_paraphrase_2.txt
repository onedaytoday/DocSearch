At the end of the cycle, the indicator light will turn off, and you will hear acoustic signals. If you've selected the appropriate option, follow the instructions below for DRAINING or SPINNING to minimize residual moisture. When the cycle is complete, the DOOR will unlock, allowing you to switch it off. The machine should be emptied afterwards. Different textiles have specific settings:

- **COTTONS (95C, 40C)**: For white and colorfast items. 
- **HYGIENE (60C)**: Specifically for whites. 
- **MIX (40C)**: For mixed items.
- **JEANS (60C, COLD)**: For denim fabric.
- **SYNTHETICS (60C, COLD)**: For synthetic garments.
- **EASY IRON (60C, COLD)**: For easy care fabrics.
- **DELICATES (40C, COLD)**: For gentle cycles.
- **WOOL (Handwash, 40C, COLD)**: For wool textiles, hand wash recommended.
- **LINGERIE (40C, COLD)**: For delicate items.
- **SILK (30C, COLD)**: For silk garments.

Prewash and rinse options, as well as night cycles, can be selected to suit various fabrics. Always sort your laundry into whites, colors, synthetics, and heavier textiles like towels. Whites should be washed separately at recommended temperatures (60C for best results). New colored items may bleed, so these should be washed separately for the first few washes. Use bleach where appropriate, ensuring it’s suitable for the fabric type.

Cleaning additives, such as fabric softeners, should be used in moderation according to guidelines. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully for both load capacity and cleaning agents used.

For maintenance and cleaning, ensure the appliance is unplugged. Regular cleaning of the drum and hoses is necessary. Inspect the drainage system and hose regularly to avoid clogs. If claims of malfunction, such as error codes, arise, refer to troubleshooting guidelines provided by the manufacturer.

For emergency drainage, disconnect the hose as required and ensure procedures are followed to safely empty and clean the machine. Observe safety precautions when working with electrical appliances and follow operational guidelines closely to ensure effective washing and maintenance.
