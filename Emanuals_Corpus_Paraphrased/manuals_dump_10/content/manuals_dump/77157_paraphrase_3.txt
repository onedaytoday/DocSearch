For connectivity, connect the VGA and Ethernet ports as needed, using RJ-45 for Ethernet and USB ports for other connections, including AC/DC power adapters for charging the station. Use mounting screws to secure the station to a countertop or other surfaces (optional). Optional accessories include a battery (E840851), strap (E697779), cover (E108413), and VESA mount (E624438), which can be purchased separately.

The VESA installation requires four M4 threaded screws to fasten the mount to the station. The station includes a processor (N2600 Core) with optional RAM (2GB DDR3) and SSD storage. The screen is a 10-inch active aspect ratio LCD with typical brightness levels, enabling touchscreen functionality via projected capacitive (PCAP) technology.

Connectivity features include USB ports, LAN RJ45, and VGA DB15 connectors. The station possesses integrated magnetic stripe reader (MSR) capabilities, Bluetooth, and wireless features. Language options available include English, French, Spanish, Simplified and Traditional Chinese.

Operating Conditions:
- Battery: 36Wh, AC input of 120/220V, current rating of 3.0A
- Operating temperature: 0°C to 40°C (32°F to 104°F), storage temperature: -20°C to 60°C (4°F to 140°F).

Unpack the station and associated items including the AC/DC charger for specific regions, ensuring to protect them adequately. Charge the battery for at least a few hours before initial use.

To install the AC/DC power, follow the outlined steps to securely fasten it to the station. Charging options involve connecting the DC adapter to the power source and ensuring a proper connection.

To use the hand strap, it can be attached via the top right screw. Adjust as necessary for comfort and accessibility.
