**Chiller Systems Overview**

Chillers are designed to cool cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, effectively reducing bacterial growth. This process allows food to be safely stored at +3°C. Chillers can be operated with or without added features, providing versatile performance. 

**Operating Modes**

The chiller has different cooling modes: Soft Chilling (2°C) and Chilling (12°C). The Arte system maintains a constant cooling rate upon food insertion. It includes features like built-in UV lights (or as optional accessories) and defrosting capabilities. The chiller's display shows a countdown timer and essential service information (P1, P2) during operation, maintaining HACCP compliance even if the cooling process is interrupted.

**Performance**

The chilling efficiency is influenced by both the type of food and other relevant factors.

**Construction and Finishing**

The chiller is constructed with AISI-grade stainless steel and features a back panel with high-density polyurethane insulation, ensuring HCFC-free compliance. It meets ISO standards and has rounded corners with an IP20 protection rating.
