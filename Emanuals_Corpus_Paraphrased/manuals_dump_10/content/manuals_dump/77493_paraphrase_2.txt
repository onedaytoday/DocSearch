- **Indicators:** Displays for battery status, alarm settings, and clock synchronization.

**Atomic Clock Functionality:**
This atomic clock receives signals from the WWVB transmitter in Colorado, allowing it to maintain accurate time throughout the U.S. Reception varies by location, especially in areas with high interference or surrounding obstructions. 

**Placement Tips:**
For optimal reception, position the clock away from interference sources and ensure the WWVB antenna has a clear line of sight to the signal. Adjust placement as necessary for reliable time function.

If you have difficulty receiving the WWVB signal, consult the manual for troubleshooting steps. Following these instructions will help ensure your clock operates accurately and efficiently.

### WWVB Signal Synchronization and Time Settings

When the WWVB signal is activated, the clock receives data that includes the seconds and month. If the clock is set to Eastern Time, it does not interact with U.S. time zones. Ensure the correct time zone is selected, as follows: Central Time Zone, Mountain Time Zone, or Pacific Time Zone. The clock automatically adjusts to the selected time zone after power restoration. For accurate operation, the internal WWVB feature must remain active to synchronize time consistently, including switching between AM and PM formats.

To synchronize the clock manually, press the DATE/MONTH and TIME buttons simultaneously. Adjust the month and date accordingly using the DATE/MONTH button, followed by the TIME/SECONDS button to set the time. If the AM/PM setting is incorrect, adjust as needed.

### Synchronization and Reception

The WWVB signal activates every hour to reduce interference, thereby improving reception quality. The clock will display the seconds when using the TIME/SECONDS setting. 

### Alarm Settings

The alarm feature allows you to select from various wake-up modes: wake to buzzer, radio, or both. Use the ALM or ALM buttons to adjust settings and ensure the correct time is set for activation. 

### Listening to the Radio

To use the radio, turn it on with the RADIO ON/OFF button. Adjust tuning and volume as necessary, then turn off using the same button.

### Alarm Operation

You can set alarms for either ALM1 or ALM2 by switching from OFF to BUZZER or RADIO. Set the alarm time using the hour and minute settings, and you can activate the snooze feature for a brief pause before the alarm sounds again.

### Sleep Timer for Music

The sleep timer can automatically turn off the radio after a set duration. Adjust the sleep time using the SLEEP button, selecting your desired duration.

### Display Dimmer Control

The brightness of the display can be adjusted using the DIMMER switch.

### Care and Maintenance

Keep the device clean by wiping it with a soft cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners.
