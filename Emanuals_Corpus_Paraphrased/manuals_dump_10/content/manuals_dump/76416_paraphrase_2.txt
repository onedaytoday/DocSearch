**PM Black Drying Warning!** 

For the loads, including synthetics, ensure the hose is correctly connected. To operate, turn the ON/OFF switch to activate the desired mode. A light indicator will appear to denote DRYING TIME. Press the START/PAUSE button, and at the end of the cycle, reset and switch OFF. 

**Important Notice on Non-Stop Drying:** Select your options for synthetics or other fabric types. If additional drying is needed beyond the standard cycle, make appropriate adjustments to reduce drying time. The lowest settings should suffice for synthetics, while heavier items may require extended drying cycles.

**Sorting Guidelines:** Prior to washing, sort items such as tablecloths and towels based on their type and condition. Wash worn or torn items separately to avoid fabric damage, and wash colored items together. Generally, white items should only be washed with whites. Ensure any items with ribbons or bleach-sensitive materials are treated accordingly.

**Machine Settings:** Use the following temperature guidelines for various fabrics: 
- Synthetics: 30°C
- Colored items: 60°C
- Prewash options vary from 30°C to 95°C depending on fabric type.

**Dry Cleaning and Other Options:** Follow specific washing symbols for different cleaning actions. Use appropriate bleach and fabric conditioners as detailed in the instructions. 

**Routine Maintenance:** Disconnect the machine from the electrical supply during cleaning. Regularly clean lint and filter components to maintain machine efficiency. For any clogs or issues with the hose, unscrew and clean as needed.

**Troubleshooting Indicators:** If error codes appear (e.g., E10, E20, E40), refer to the manual for steps to resolve these issues. If problems persist, contact Service Force for professional assistance.
