### Installation Guidelines for Appliance and Cabinet

**General Notes**: 

To ensure the safety of children, it is advisable to install the appliance with an earthing connection. Ensure that the installation aligns with the specified sections regarding electrical supply and assembly. Utilize the appropriate screws for fastening, which should be inserted from the back of the unit.

**Electrical Connection**: 

The appliance must be connected to a 220V-240V supply. If the installation differs, appropriate adjustments need to be made per the relevant electrical codes, including the use of a suitable terminal block for connections. Avoid using plastic or ceramic connection terminal blocks or insulation tape for extending the cable. When connecting the wires, follow these color codes: 

- Brown (Live) to 'L' terminal
- Blue (Neutral) to 'N' terminal
- Green and Yellow (Earth) to 'E' terminal 

Install an appropriate rated fuse in the plug holder.

**Pressure Testing**: 

Access the pressure test point located on the right side of the appliance. Turn the gas supply on, adjust the thermostat accordingly, and check for gas flow and ignition. After testing, ensure all connections are secure and confirm proper operation.

**Appliance Reassembly**: 

To remove the fascia panel, unscrew the securing screws and detach gently. To reinstall, follow the reverse procedure. 

**Checking Grill and Oven**: 

Upon reassembly, verify that the grill ignites correctly and that the switches turn off the supply when closed. Set the time of day on the clock by rotating the dial clockwise.

**Operational Testing**: 

Turn on the oven thermostat and confirm that it lights up properly. Monitor the function of the flame safety device (F.S.D.) to ensure proper gas flow and activation.

**Warranty Information**: 

The warranty covers workmanship-related issues for a specified duration following purchase. To maintain warranty validity, ensure that the appliance is serviced by authorized personnel and adheres to the specified electrical ratings.
