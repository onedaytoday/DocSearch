### Cooking Guidelines

Key considerations when cooking include using appropriate cookware that is thick and rough to prevent scratching. Ensure you are cautious with high heat to avoid damaging the cooking surface.

Be attentive to temperature settings when cooking various food types, as different foods require specific heat levels. For example, utilize the frying function for items like meat or goulash, and switch functions as necessary to optimize cooking.

### Cleaning Instructions

For maintenance, avoid abrasive cleaners that might scratch the cooking surface. Use a soft cloth for cleaning. In cases of stubborn residues, utilize recommended cleaning products specifically designed for that purpose. 

Immediate attention is necessary for burnt-on food to prevent permanent damage; clean with appropriate cloths and cleaning agents.
