### EOG Introduction

This document is aligned with Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It serves as the initial written guideline detailing the proper usage and maintenance of cooking appliances. Users are advised to adhere closely to the provided instructions, especially regarding the preparation of food and the operation of various features.

If the initial instructions have been adhered to, additional details may expand on safety, operational standards, and acceptable practices. This includes information about recommended ratings and operational guidelines relative to different cooking scenarios.

### Technical Details

The lighting and cooling mechanisms must be serviced as specified in the current edition. Care should be taken regarding the cooking height and heat distribution to ensure optimal performance. Users should familiarize themselves with the appliance's operational limits to avoid prolonged exposure to high heat, which can affect mechanical efficiency.

For accurate operation, follow these detailed guidelines conscientiously. Factors such as the housing material and potential fire hazards should be considered, especially concerning items that may ignite or affect the integrity of the appliance.

### Electrical and Safety Considerations

When connecting to an electricity supply, ensure the appliance is properly earthed and fitted with appropriate safeguards. Avoid using appliances with unsafe modifications or those not conforming to ASTA or BS standards. If malfunctions occur, inspect all connections, and ensure the appliance is not overloaded or incorrectly configured.

### Cooking Instructions

For optimal cooking results, adjust the settings as follows: turn the dial from ‘OFF’ to ‘HIGH’ for robust heating, then to ‘LOW’ for gentler cooking tasks. Routinely check the food to ensure even cooking and adjust settings as needed.

Preheating may be necessary for certain dishes, aiding in even heat distribution. Recommended shelf adjustments should be adhered to, particularly for roasting or cooking thicker items. Consider covering food to avoid moisture loss and promote even cooking.

### Food Preparation Guidelines

Thaw foods completely before cooking, referring to the cooking chart for recommended times and temperatures. Ensure even cooking by following the prescribed guidelines for different food types.

Reheating should be conducted carefully, ensuring food is adequately heated throughout without compromising safety. Monitor cooking times closely to prevent undesirable outcomes.

### Clock and Timer Functions

When using the appliance’s clock, refer to the provided manual for guidance on setting timers and managing cooking operations. Upon switching on, the clock may flash until configured, after which it can be utilized for timing various cooking tasks effectively.

For further assistance regarding the appliance's operation, consult the service manual or service force as necessary.

**Overview of Appliance Operation and Maintenance**

To operate the appliance effectively, begin by setting the timer correctly. The display will indicate cooking times, which depend on the type of food being prepared. Make sure the power supply is connected, and once the cooking is done, the timer will signal completion by flashing. To turn off the appliance, simply switch off the power.

When using the cooking pot, ensure it is covered and filled with fresh ingredients, ideally sourced directly from the butcher or market. Be mindful of food safety: follow guidelines regarding the freshness of meat and ensure dishes are properly cooked. Refer to the cooking chart for specific cooking times tailored to different food types.

In terms of cleaning, always allow the appliance to cool completely before engaging in any maintenance. Use a soft cloth to clean all surfaces, avoiding abrasive cleaners that could damage the finish. Pay special attention to the shelves, as food splatters can occur during cooking. Regular cleaning will maintain the appliance’s appearance and functionality.

For safety purposes, ensure that the appliance is installed properly, adhering to all local regulations and safety standards (BS.6172, BS.5440, and BS.6891). The appliance should not be placed in areas like bathrooms or anywhere with inadequate ventilation. 

Installation should be carried out using the correct type of hoses and fittings to meet safety codes. Ensure that hoses are securely connected and fuel supplies are correctly isolated before usage. 

If you require servicing or repairs, contact the service provider with details about your appliance and any issues encountered. Follow the instructions provided for any necessary repairs to maintain safety and efficiency.
