#### HINTS AND TIPS
When using the oven, it's recommended to count shelves from the top down. For best cooking results, place food centrally on the shelves to facilitate even heat distribution. This is particularly important for dishes like cakes and pastries, which should be spaced at appropriate intervals to ensure proper cooking.

### MAIN OVEN CONVENTIONAL COOKING

Conventional cooking allows for various cooking techniques without relying on fan assistance. Ideal for dishes such as gratins and casseroles, the oven can easily be set to the desired function by pressing the cavity and function buttons. Set the temperature to 200°C. To turn off the function, simply press it once.

### THINGS TO NOTE
The oven light indicates when the heat is reached, followed by a sound alert. If cooking is shorter than expected, consult the Heat Function section for assistance. The internal cooling fan will operate, notifying you throughout the cooking process.

#### HINTS AND TIPS
When cooking, ensure that food is centered and not overcrowded on the shelf to facilitate better browning and cooking. This is especially crucial for items like Yorkshire pudding and cakes. Use enamelware or heavy pans to enhance the baking process.

### MAIN OVEN COOKING CHART
