### Cooking Instructions:
Preheat your oven for cooking cookies, bread, cakes, or roasting meat. Be sure to allow for adequate preheating, as improper temperatures can lead to uneven cooking or warping. Ensure that the oven is not overcrowded for optimal heat distribution, and maintain the recommended cooking temperature—typically 25°F (12°C) higher or lower than indicated can negatively impact results. Follow provided guidelines for food clearance to prevent warping or damage.

### Cleaning Instructions:
Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and cooled down. Promptly address spills and heavy soiling to minimize the need for extensive cleaning later. Regular maintenance will help reduce the frequency of major clean-ups. Utilize a soft cloth for painted and decorative elements; avoid abrasive materials or harsh chemicals that might harm the finish. For tough, baked-on stains, use suitable cleaning agents while following care instructions. 

Do not immerse surface elements in water, and exercise caution with the use of cleansers. Adhere to recommended products like CERAMA BRYTE for specific cleaning needs and ensure to cool down surfaces before handling. 

### Additional Cleaning Information:
For self-cleaning functions, allow the appliance to cool before starting. Remove all racks and heavily soiled items before cleaning. Wear protective gear during manual cleaning to avoid health risks. Avoid using cleaners that might damage protective coatings or the self-cleaning function. 

When operating, the oven may emit higher temperatures than normal during self-cleaning. Address any necessary cleaning from both the interior and exterior surfaces, using cloths for wipe-down. 

### Cautionary Measures:
Ensure to follow all safety precautions while handling the appliance. Missteps can lead to injuries or equipment malfunction. The appliance’s warranty covers service for workmanship but may not cover issues arising from misuse or improper installation. 

**Common Issues**: If experiencing malfunction, check for proper installation and ensure clearance. Be mindful of cookware weight and suitability; heavy cookware can cause uneven cooking. Use appropriately matched cookware to prevent damage and ensure efficient heating.

**Occurrence and Potential Causes/Solutions**

This guide covers possible causes and solutions related to cooking operations or the self-cleaning function of your appliance. Issues may arise when transporting cookware in and out, which can lead to scratches on cooktops or cookware. Ensure that the appliance is clean and properly maintained, particularly the bottoms of cookware, to prevent food residue.

For optimal cooking, allow the appliance to preheat as recommended, as insufficient preheating may cause uneven cooking. If self-cleaning is interrupted frequently, grease buildup can occur due to improper cleaning. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the self-cleaning function to avoid overheating, and ensure that meat is positioned correctly to allow for proper clearance.
