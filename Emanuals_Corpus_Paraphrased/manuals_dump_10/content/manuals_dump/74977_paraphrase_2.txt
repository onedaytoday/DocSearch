The microwave oven can automatically handle defrosting and cooking of selected foods. The system determines which food types can be defrosted and prepared, allowing for streamlined cooking processes. Ensure you unpack food items properly, particularly those at the top, to facilitate effective defrosting.

To begin cooking, select the appropriate options (C1, C2, C3) for heat-resistant food. Follow guidelines for fresh produce quantities based on categories (I+II), such as sprouts and celery.

To defrost, press the PROGRAMME button until the desired setting appears, then use the Rotary dial to select options. Activate the START/QUICK button to initiate the process. If needed, you can stop the program by pressing the CLEAR button.
