## Main Fan Oven Functions

### Usage of the Fan Oven
The primary fan oven circulates heated air from the back, ensuring even cooking. 

### Preheating
Preheating the oven is essential, typically to around the recommended cooking temperature. Cooking without preheating may not achieve the desired quality, particularly for frozen or prepared meals.

### Cooking Temperatures
It is advisable to follow the temperature chart, reducing the recommended temperature by 20°C to 25°C for batch baking.

### Batch Baking
When using the oven for batch baking, ensure proper shelf placement toward the back to allow for optimal heat circulation. Position the shelves correctly to avoid impacting cooking results. It’s recommended to space the shelves appropriately for even cooking, particularly for cakes and similar foods.

### Oven Cooking Chart
For various dishes, follow the cooking temperature and time guidelines specified in the chart. Adjustments can be made within a range of ±10°C as necessary.

### Roasting Chart
Refer to the roasting chart for specific meat types and required internal temperatures. Adjust based on size and cooking method.

### Defrost Feature
The defrost function is efficient for thawing frozen items, including cakes with frostings. It is essential to thaw all types of meat completely before cooking and to cook immediately after thawing.

### Care and Cleaning

#### General Care
Always switch off the electrical supply and allow the appliance to cool before cleaning. Use recommended cleaning agents and avoid bleach-based products.

#### Cleaning the Ceramic Hob
For daily cleaning, use a specialized cleaner like Brite, applying it directly to the affected areas. For stubborn marks, a non-abrasive cleaner may be necessary. Avoid using Brillo pads or harsh chemicals as they can damage the finish.

#### Cleaning Inside the Grill/Oven Compartment
The Stayclean coating aids in self-cleaning but requires attention to ensure optimal performance.

#### Cleaning Door Glass
Use non-abrasive cleaners on the door glass, and for the space between the outer and inner glass, follow specific instructions to avoid damage.

### Troubleshooting
If issues arise, check the power supply and ensure the oven is functioning within the recommended settings. For any persistent problems, consult the Service Force for assistance.
