Use enamelware, heavy, or non-stick cookware to enhance browning. 

**Main Oven Cooking**

**Batch Baking:** Adjust temperatures down by 20-25C when baking multiple items simultaneously.

**Notes on Operation:** Ensure the oven light is functioning properly. Familiarize yourself with the layout and accessibility of the shelves; they should be straight with adequate clearance in the cavity for airflow.
