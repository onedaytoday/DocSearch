### I. GENERAL INFORMATION
#### Safety and Usage Guidelines for Installation and Initial Operation
It is essential to install the appliance in accordance with authorized guidelines and ensure proper electricity supply. Following the operating instructions is crucial for safe operation. The owner is responsible for ensuring that the equipment is examined by a qualified technician at least once a year, as per applicable regulations.

#### Usage Guidelines
- Avoid using closed containers that can burst when heated.
- Take precautions to prevent high-pressure scenarios or accidents during operation.
- Ensure that food items in the heating trough are adequately monitored to prevent fire hazards and overflow.
- Food should not be physically obstructed when in the frying process.

### II. INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Installation Guidelines**: Ensure the appliance is installed with adequate space for ventilation and complies with FDA standards.
2. **Distance from Heat Sources**: Maintain the appropriate distance from heat-insulating surfaces.
3. **Height Adjustment**: Adjust the foot or plinth of the appliance as necessary, ensuring stability and the recommended clearance.

### III. OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Initial Setup**: Ensure that the trough is Thermostatically controlled. Activate the main switch and set the desired temperature (212°F to 356°F; 100°C to 180°C). The operating light indicates when the desired temperature is reached.
  
2. **Deep Frying Procedure**: Maintain an appropriate amount of food in the trough and monitor closely for optimal frying conditions.

### IV. ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS
**Connecting Appliances**: Use mounting screws to securely attach each unit. Verify the assembly aligns with NSF/ANSI standards to ensure safety and efficacy during operation.

### V. ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS
- Ensure all electrical connections comply with local specifications, including grounding requirements.
- For plinth installations, make sure connections are properly centered and insulated to prevent electric shock hazards.

### VI. MAINTENANCE
Regular maintenance and cleaning should be performed when the unit is off and cooled. It is recommended that cleaning occurs at least annually.

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
- Technical specifications can be referenced for specific models. Tested and certified appliances possess a specification plate with essential manufacturing details. 

In conclusion, adherence to these guidelines ensures not only safe operation but also compliance with industry standards for the Therma S90 Electric Deep Fryer.

### Oil Care Instructions

To begin, switch the device to the "cool" position. Open the drainage valve and collect the oil. Rotate the valve counterclockwise to unlock it, allowing the oil to flow into the collection container. Clean the trough and the surrounding area thoroughly and replace the cover.

### Changing the Frying Oil

As the oil ages, it will require replacement. Here is the process:

1. Turn the switch to the "cool" setting and let the oil cool in the trough.
2. Open the drainage valve to allow the oil to exit into the collection container.
3. Dispose of the used oil responsibly.

### Cleaning Instructions

Before cleaning, ensure the trough has cooled. Turn off the valve and allow the oil to drain completely. Clean the trough, the cover, and any collection equipment with a cloth. Use a suitable cleaner, ensuring no residue remains. For thorough cleaning, high-pressure cleaning equipment may be used, although normal cleaning methods can suffice to prevent buildup.

### Operating Instructions

Follow these steps to shut down properly:

1. Ensure the temperatures are below 32°F (0°C).
2. Use a cloth to apply a thin protective coating on the trough regularly.

### Malfunctions

If malfunctions occur, check the following:

- If the STB (safety thermal breaker) has tripped due to overheating.
- Inspect the heating element for defects.
- Ensure the thermostat is functioning correctly; it should operate at around 230°C.

In case of issues, contact service personnel for assistance.

### General Installation and Operation Instructions

Ensure compliance with all safety guidelines in the installed environment. Follow user obligations and utilize the equipment correctly to maintain a safe working atmosphere.
