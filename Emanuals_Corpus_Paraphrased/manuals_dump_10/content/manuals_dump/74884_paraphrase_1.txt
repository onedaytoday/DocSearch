### Initial Startup
Once the unit is ready for operation, ensure that the switch is set to the ON position. The unit should be connected to a properly grounded 115V power supply. Initially, the unit will take a few seconds to start the ice-making process. It’s crucial to monitor this during the first few hours of operation.

### Cycle Selector Switch
#### Normal Operation
The unit continuously circulates water to the trough, where it freezes in layers. When the ice reaches a certain thickness, the system turns off, allowing the ice to accumulate. This cycle is repeated, with the system ensuring optimal cleanliness. You may hear sounds relating to ice thickness adjustments; different variations in ice thickness can occur due to batch differences.

### Ice Dispenser Operation Care
The factory settings define the ice cube thickness, which can be adjusted by turning the dial either clockwise or counterclockwise. Allow the system some time to create a new batch after making adjustments.

### Special Considerations
For optimal performance, avoid exposing the machine to extreme temperatures. If the ambient temperature is expected to fall below 45°F (7°C), the unit must be covered to maintain warranty coverage. Conversely, if temperatures exceed 110°F (43°C), proper function may be compromised.

### Maintenance and Cleaning
To maintain the efficiency and longevity of your icemaker, regular cleaning is essential. Use appropriate cleaners and avoid abrasive materials that can damage stainless steel surfaces. High-quality all-in-one cleaners and polishes can be used monthly. Avoid steel wool and harsh chemicals, as they can harm the finish.

### Cleaning Schedule
Routine cleaning should be performed every three months to ensure performance. Ensure all screws are properly secured during maintenance to prevent sharp edges.

### Troubleshooting
Before seeking service, perform basic troubleshooting. Check power connections and ensure the unit is appropriately switched on. If issues persist, contact the retailer for further assistance, providing them with unit details.

Always adhere to safety precautions and manufacturer recommendations when performing maintenance or troubleshooting to minimize risks associated with electric shock or equipment failure.
