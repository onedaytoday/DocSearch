- **Text1**, **Text2**, and **Text3**: These modes emphasize text clarity, with B&W characters appearing sharp.
- **Graphics Mode**: This setting ensures that images and photographs are displayed with high clarity.

Edge enhancement features (White Edge Effect) can also be adjusted, allowing for sharper transitions in graphics. The intensity can be set manually or automatically via the One-Push function. 

**Input Selection**
For input connections, options include USB (for PC applications) and SD card. The system can switch to display modes accordingly and recognizes whether connected devices should be displayed.

**Wireless Remote Functions**
Using the wireless remote, you can manage preset states and memory functions. The functionality allows toggling between color and black-and-white displays and various brightness levels.

**Operation Procedures**
Setting up involves connecting SD or USB devices to the system. Ensure proper electrical supply connections to prevent issues. Functions such as focus adjustment (AF), zoom, and light operations can be accessed via the front interface or the remote. 

For optimal operation, it is advised to use recommended SD cards with capacities appropriate for the display setup. The system allows switching between various display modes and formats as necessary.

**Cautions and Notes**
Avoid forced manipulation, as this might damage the mechanical components. Always verify battery orientation and condition for the wireless remote.

Overall, careful management of input settings and OSD functionalities will enhance usability and performance in various operating environments.

To operate the device, either use the front panel or the wireless remote to navigate to the SD card or display options on the screen. Press the [MENU] button on the wireless remote to access the OSD options. To confirm a selection, press [ENTER] on the remote. For switching output to the SD card, access the OSD, select [START SLIDE SHOW], and then use the [ENTER] and [Effect] buttons on the remote. The SD card can be formatted by selecting the corresponding option in the OSD via the front panel or remote, and you'll need to format the SD card if necessary.

For software application using a USB-connected PC, utilize the software from the CD-ROM to allow operations like transferring images from the PC to the device. The PC must be running a compatible Microsoft OS, such as Win 2000 (SP4) or XP (SP2 or later). Ensure the USB connection adheres to USB 2.0 standards.

In shooting mode, the head can be rotated for optimal framing, maintaining smooth operation whether it is in TELE or WIDE mode. Regarding task operations, ensure RGB input options are properly configured for devices connected to [RGB IN], while output settings reflect changes made in the OSD.

The autofocus feature can be triggered using the [AF] button, which locks focus after a one-time activation. Adjustments can be made for proximity focusing with the [FOCUS NEAR] or [FOCUS FAR] buttons. The device can also manage brightness settings through the OSD, with options to recall or save presets.

RS-232C communication allows for remote control functions via a PC connection. Commands are formatted for one-command/one-packet communication, ensuring accurate data exchanges. Parity settings and command functions can be specified for operating various features, such as lighting and slide-shows, which can also be controlled via the RS-232C interface.
