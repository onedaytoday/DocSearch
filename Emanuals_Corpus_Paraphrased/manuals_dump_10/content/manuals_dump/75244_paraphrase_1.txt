For poultry, the cooking begins once the timer is activated, and auditory signals will prompt you to turn the meat over during the cooking process. The ovenâ€™s functions accommodate multiple meat types, ensuring optimal cooking results. If you need to change the meat selection, turn the appliance off and then back on.
