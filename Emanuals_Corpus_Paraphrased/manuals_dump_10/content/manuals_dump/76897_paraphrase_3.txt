To ensure a smooth and accurate installation, please read these straightforward instructions before beginning. Verify that your installation complies with all relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes. Grounding electrical equipment such as telephones and computers to water lines is standard practice, whether within or outside the building. This grounding may induce electrical feedback into the fountain, resulting in electrolytic reactions that impart a metallic taste or increase metal concentration in the water. This issue can be mitigated by utilizing the appropriate materials as specified. Any drain fittings supplied by the installer should be made of plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the building's plumbing system. 

When supplying water, ensure the outer diameter (O.D.) is unplated iron pipe size (IPS) and thoroughly flush the lines before connecting to the fountain. The fountain should connect to the water supply using shut-off valves and unplated materials, while removing any burrs from the tubes. Do not solder on tubes that are inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. Be aware that any issues caused may exceed the warranty if the supply is inadequate or above acceptable levels. 

IMPORTANT: All service must be conducted by an authorized technician. For installation guidance, reference part number 4595_FTN. 

The fountain should be mounted on a smooth, finished surface, and the mounting should include a rough-in for the shut-off supply. Use screws or fasteners that are provided for this purpose. 

CAUTION: Ensure the water supply pressure does not exceed the fountain's rated PSI, and adjust it as necessary to comply with the specifications outlined in the instructions. 

For stream height adjustments, set the factory PSI; adjust clockwise or counter-clockwise as needed to achieve the desired flow. 

For parts, contact your local distributor or call the manufacturer. A detailed parts list is printed in the U.S.A. For troubleshooting and maintenance, follow the specified flow direction carefully, and maintain cleanliness when adjusting the stream height. 

Connect the cold water supply to the building's water inlet using unplated copper tubing (not furnished).
