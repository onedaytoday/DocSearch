**Application Notes for Water Heater Installation**

The water heater can accommodate a cold water input with an optional combination for heating and flow control through a designated flow switch, which is recommended for managing GPM (gallons per minute) through various head pressures. A relay rated above 85W should be utilized. If this relay is in operation, the heater's functioning temperature must be maintained at 10°F (5°C) below the set point as specified by the installation guidelines. Key features include integrated shut-off and service options for easier management of any GPM flow through the heater. 

Caution is advised when using higher temperature settings to prevent the risk of scalding. Backflow prevention is also critical as the heater is primarily designed for heating only. 

**Remote Operation Instructions**

When connecting the remote cord to the unit, ensure it is securely attached. The process involves aligning both black and white wires to their corresponding connectors. Review the connection points carefully prior to operation to avoid potential malfunctions or safety hazards. 

**Installation Specifications**

1. Create a 4-0.5" oblong hole as specified.
2. Maintain the height of each fitting from the bottom of the casing for proper drainage and alignment.
3. Ensure to properly connect both gas and cold water inlets and outlets, as well as condensate drains and air inlets.

**Additional Notes:**

When securing the installation with wall anchors, avoid direct sunlight exposure to the components. Make sure to check all wiring thoroughly to ensure functionality and compliance with safety standards during and after installation.
