### Operating and Installation Instructions for the Freezer (EU)

#### Important Safety Information
Please retain this instruction manual for future reference. If the appliance is sold or transferred to another owner, ensure that this manual accompanies it, as it contains essential information regarding its operation and safety. Always adhere to the guidelines specified for the optimal functioning of the appliance. 

**Warning:**
The freezer is heavy; use proper techniques when moving it. In case of power supply issues, consult Service Force for assistance. Avoid allowing children to play with or near the appliance, as it can pose risks. Only store food intended for freezing inside the freezer. Improper handling can lead to freezer burn or spoilage. 

**Instructions for Defrosting and Cleaning:**
When defrosting, allow the freezer to thaw naturally; do not use sharp tools to remove ice. If frost accumulation becomes excessive, it should be manually defrosted to maintain efficiency.

#### Appliance Description
This section includes details about recommended food storage, operation, and error indications.

#### Operation
- **Thermostat Settings:** 
  The thermostat is controlled using dial A. Turning it to the "O" position will power off the freezer. Adjust settings based on the desired food temperature.
- **Fast Freeze Function:** 
  Activate the fast freeze switch (B) for optimal storage of fresh food by freezing it quickly, indicated by light C. This setting should be used when introducing substantial amounts of fresh food.

**Warning:** 
If food begins to thaw, it should not be refrozen unless fully cooked. Ice-creams and certain other items also have specific requirements for storage.

#### Hints and Tips
Normal operational sounds might include whirring or coolant flowing, which is standard. Ensure food is tightly packaged to preserve quality and prevent odor absorption. Avoid placing hot food directly into the freezer; allow it to cool to room temperature first.

#### Defrosting
Frost buildup exceeding a quarter-inch should be defrosted. To facilitate this, empty the freezer, using newspaper and towels for protection and collecting defrosted water. 

#### Maintenance and Cleaning
Before cleaning, disconnect the freezer from the electrical supply. Use mild soap and water for cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. 

#### Troubleshooting
If issues arise such as excessive frost or temperature problems, please reference the symptom guide provided. If self-diagnosis fails, contact Service Force for professional assistance.
