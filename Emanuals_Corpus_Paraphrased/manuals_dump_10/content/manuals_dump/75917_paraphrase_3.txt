### Operating Instructions: Controls
The refrigerator may operate on either AC (V) or LP gas. The operating controls include a main power switch (A), a thermostat (C), and additional control switches (B, D, E). Ensure that the thermostat is set according to the selected power supply.

### Starting the Refrigerator
To initiate operation, ensure that the gas bottle is full and the valve is open. Activate the main power supply (D) and set the thermostat (E) to the highest setting. The indicator light should flash, signaling that the unit is beginning to operate.

### Winter Operation
For optimal performance during winter, utilize the winter cover when temperatures fall below 0°C. This assists in maintaining effective cooling.

### Regulating Temperature
Allow the refrigerator several hours to reach its optimal cooling temperature. Adjust the thermostat as necessary based on the type of power supply in use.

### Travel Catch
Ensure the travel catch is engaged for secure transportation. The catch should be properly positioned to prevent the door from opening during transit.

### Food Storage
Store food items properly to maintain freshness and avoid spoilage. Follow guidelines to prevent items from freezing and ensure containers are suitable.

### Ice Making and Defrosting
Defrost the unit periodically to enhance performance. Excessive frost buildup can negatively impact efficiency and should be managed accordingly.

### Cleaning the Refrigerator
Regularly clean the interior with a soft cloth and mild cleaning solution to maintain hygiene. Avoid using harsh scrubbing materials that could damage the surface.

### Turning Off the Refrigerator
To turn off the unit, switch off the main power (D) and disconnect any gas supply for safety. Ensure the refrigerator is defrosted and properly stored if not in use.

### Troubleshooting 
If the refrigerator fails to operate, check the following: Ensure the connections are secure, the gas bottle isn’t empty, and that all settings are correct.

### Maintenance
Authorized technicians should oversee installations and maintenance according to industry regulations. It is crucial for safety and efficiency.

### Useful Tips
Keep the refrigerator door closed as much as possible to maintain cooling efficiency. Regularly check and manage frost buildup.

### INSTALLATION GUIDELINES

**Heat Management**  
The orientation of the cooker must be considered to minimize radiated heat from below, which can adversely affect performance. Ideally, the vehicle should be oriented toward the south to maximize heat management and vent combustion gases. Proper coverage of the vehicle is crucial to maintaining cooling efficiency and preventing performance decline.

**Technical Specifications**  
Refer to the provided technical data. Make sure components fit securely within the designated recess, allowing sufficient space for airflow and the necessary access to screws that secure the components against vehicle forces. If required, additional insulation may be installed to improve performance.

**Ventilation**  
Ensure adequate ventilation, especially during high operational conditions. Fresh air should circulate through designated openings, ideally maintaining temperatures as specified (e.g., at least X°C). The design allows for easy inspection and repairs without excessive disassembly. Protect external air intake areas from debris and ensure they are sealed appropriately, especially during winter.

**LP Gas Connection**  
Connect the LP gas system as specified. Verify that the gas supplied to the refrigerator maintains the correct pressure by checking the reducing valve. Use authorized connections and ensure continuous flow via threaded fittings. Avoid using push-on connections. The gas supply should connect securely to the designated threaded coupling.

**Electrical Connection**  
All electrical installations must comply with current I.E.E. regulations, incorporating the correct outlet and coupling standards. Ensure that the mains voltage wiring is properly earthed. Use the following color codes for connections:  
- Green-and-yellow for Earth  
- Blue for Neutral  
- Brown for Live  

**Warning**: This appliance must be earthed. The installation must take into account local regulations and ratings as noted on the appliance's data plate. Ensure all wiring is routed correctly to maintain operational safety.

**Final Assembly**  
Refer to specified diagrams for the installation of components (designated as A, B, C, etc.). Ensure secure connections and verify that the appliance is connected directly to a suitable battery charger. If necessary, review insulation and heating arrangements for optimal performance.
