It's important to ensure that the screw on the right side of the front panel is correctly fastened. The device must be properly grounded and tested for safety. It operates on a three-phase electrical system with appropriate wiring and is equipped with a Residual Current Device (RCD) for shock protection. This system safeguards against electrical hazards, particularly heat-related risks, as specified in the technical specifications.

When setting up the device, it’s essential to connect each phase correctly; incorrect connections can lead to reversed rotation, which will impact functionality. Make sure the assembly aligns and operates correctly, and remember to turn off the power before making any adjustments.

In terms of maintenance, perform regular cleanings and ensure any tools used are suitable for the task. When operating, users should wear hearing protection, especially in environments with high noise levels, to prevent hearing damage. Additionally, adhere to provided operating instructions to maintain safety.

This device is designed to accept several types of blades and tools, though caution should be taken to prevent overheating or any build-up of debris that could impair its performance. Always turn off the machine when undergoing maintenance or when changing components to avoid accidents. Finally, keep the instruction manual on hand as it contains vital information for safe operation and troubleshooting.
