**Cooking Shelf Guidelines**

When using the cooking shelf, ensure to adhere to the provided instructions which specify cooking times and temperatures based on the type and height of the item being prepared. For optimal results, preheat the oven before cooking. Be mindful that cooking durations may need adjustment based on the specific item, especially for cakes and breads. If the dish appears undercooked, consider extending the time or adjusting the temperature higher, ensuring to monitor the cooking process.

**Baking Instructions**

For items such as wholemeal and white bread, adjust the shelf selection based on the recipe requirements, ensuring they are positioned correctly within the oven for even cooking. Preheating is essential for proper baking.

When roasting, utilize heat-resistant dishes. Ensure that meats are placed properly on the roasting tray to prevent mess and promote even cooking. Use the rotitherm function for consistent results with meats and poultry, and refer to the specific instructions for various types of meat preparation.

For defrosting, utilize the designated function, setting the temperature to 30Â°C. Cover the food appropriately to enhance the defrosting process. Keep in mind to follow the chart for accurate timing for different food items.
