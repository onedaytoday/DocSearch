### Installation and Uninstallation Instructions

To manage the user account, follow the given process. For uninstallation, navigate to Settings, select Programs and Features, choose Touch, and proceed with the uninstallation command. If single-touch operation is desired, follow these steps:

1. Access the Common directory and locate the `EloOptions.ini` file. 
2. Set the `EnableOneTouch` parameter as needed.

For those preferring multi-touch:

- Navigate to the Touch directory to access advanced properties and calibration options for each connected touchscreen. 

**Advanced Features:**

2. **Calibration and Preferences:**  
   - The calibration function should be performed for each touchscreen. This guarantees that touch interactions are recognized correctly based on user settings. 

3. **Sound Notifications:**  
   - Users can enable sound feedback for touches, which can either play through the internal motherboard or external speakers based on settings in `EloOptions.ini`.

4. **Input Control Options:**  
   - Users can specify the behavior of touch interactions, such as whether clicks are registered upon touch release. The options are customizable based on preferences.

5. **Custom Touch Areas:**  
   - Configure active touch zones or restrict touch inputs, with options to define the duration for those inputs.

### Commands and Configuration

Firmware commands can be specified within the `EloOptions.ini` file for device configuration through USB or RS-232 interfaces. The commands can be in decimal, hexadecimal, or character format, allowing flexible integration depending on user needs.
