**Tiller Handle Breakage and Start-Up Procedures**  
Ensure the coil starter handle on your tiller is intact and properly grounded for effective operation. Follow the necessary steps for tine operation checks as outlined in the service manual. **Caution:** Familiarize yourself with throttle settings (Fast and Idle) prior to use. Adjust the handle height appropriately, ensuring clearances between the tines and the ground. When tilling, pay attention to the soil condition and manage operational speed to avoid issues like soil balling or wrapping of materials around the tines.

**Maintenance Schedule**  
Document the dates of completed maintenance tasks. Regularly inspect, clean, and service components based on usage conditions, particularly if operating under heavy loads. Adhere strictly to the service guidelines and conduct inspections at least once per season. Follow recommended lubrication practices before each use and at specified hour intervals, ensuring to use the correct oil type (SAE 10W-30 or equivalent).

Consult the maintenance section for detailed oil change procedures and inspection protocols. Use the lubrication chart for comprehensive maintenance tasks.

**Air Filter Maintenance**  
Inspect and maintain the air cleaner and its components to ensure optimal operation. Avoid exposure to harsh elements that could damage the system.
