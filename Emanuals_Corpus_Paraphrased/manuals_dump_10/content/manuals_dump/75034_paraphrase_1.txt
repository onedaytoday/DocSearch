Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided instructions:

During the cooking process, the appliance operates automatically. Cooking begins when the door is closed and the START/+30 button is pressed. To adjust the power level, access the power options. You can increase or decrease the cooking time using the TIMER/WEIGHT control, turning it clockwise or counter-clockwise. To pause or stop cooking, press the STOP button.

The START/+30 function allows you to add 30 seconds of high microwave cooking directly. If you wish to utilize the AUTO COOK or AUTO DEFROST features, simply press the corresponding buttons, which will display the cooking time and settings. The Plus and Minus options enable you to adjust the cooking time as necessary.

For grill functions, use the TIMER/WEIGHT control to select the desired settings. The appliance operates on various modes, including MICROWAVE, GRILL, or DUAL GRILL, allowing you to determine the cooking duration in seconds. 

You can choose from multiple AUTO COOK and AUTO DEFROST options, such as for defrosting meat or poultry. When using these preset functions, ensure that sound prompts signal the cooking and defrosting stages.

Ensure proper food arrangement for even cooking as outlined in the accompanying charts, which provide guidelines for different food types and cooking methods. 

If culinary adjustments are required, consider reducing the cooking time by one-third to one-half, especially for items like meat and poultry, to prevent overcooking. 

When preparing various dishes, using grease or appropriate coverings is recommended to ensure even heat distribution and prevent sticking. Always refer to the supplied cooking charts for quantities and additional preparation tips for specific recipes.

Finally, pay attention to the suggested cooking techniques for different ingredients, ensuring proper seasoning and presentation for optimal results. Adjustments in cooking times and methods may be necessary based on the specific characteristics of the foods being prepared.

To prepare a gratin dish, first sauté chopped onions and minced garlic until fragrant. Next, combine these ingredients with finely chopped thyme and grated pears in a suitable pan. Season, cover, and cook until softened, ensuring the flavors meld. Spread this mixture in a baking dish, layering it with seasoned minced meat. Add a layer of the prepared pear mixture on top, then cover and cook until heated through.

**Cleaning Guidance for Your Microwave:**
Avoid using commercial oven cleaners, steam cleaners, abrasive materials, or any cleansers containing sodium hydroxide. Clean your microwave regularly, promptly removing any food residues. Use a soft cloth or towel; only mild cleaners are recommended. Ensure the interior components, such as the turntable, are cleaned appropriately—these can typically be washed in the dishwasher. If food splatters occur, wipe them up immediately to maintain hygiene.

**Operating Your Microwave:**
Ensure the microwave is properly closed and the turntable is correctly positioned. The START/+30 button must be engaged. If food isn’t cooking evenly, check that there’s nothing obstructing the microwave's operation underneath. In case of issues, consult the authorized ELECTROLUX service.
