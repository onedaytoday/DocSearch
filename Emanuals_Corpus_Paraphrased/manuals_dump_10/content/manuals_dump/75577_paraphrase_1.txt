The system comprises coolers designed for maintaining temperatures between -10°C and -21°C, featuring built-in or external components. These units include three types, designed for efficient assembly and installation, and are pre-charged for optimal cooling performance. They utilize new injection technology to ensure high-quality operation, with pre-painted insulation that is free from CFCs and HCFCs.

The design incorporates rounded internal corners and a fast-fit assembly that allows for easy mounting of high-density PVC for enhanced airtightness. These coolers are suitable for temperatures up to +43°C and operate with refrigerants like R404A, accommodating both high and low pressure. Performance features include a heated defrost system to reduce defrost cycle times, internal lighting (IP54 rated), and controls including an ON/OFF switch, lighting control, and a thermostat. The right-hinged door is designed for smooth operation and high insulation, helping to minimize energy loss and ensure compliance with HACCP standards.
