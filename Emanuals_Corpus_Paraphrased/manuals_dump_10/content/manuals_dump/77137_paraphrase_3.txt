### Chapter: Troubleshooting the Touch Monitor

If users experience issues with the NEC touch monitor, please ensure the device is securely connected. Check the connection and power status of the monitor, making sure it is powered on and that the correct input source is selected. If troubleshooting is necessary, consult the device documentation available at www.elotouch.com. 

To enhance performance, verify that the monitor is fully seated and that all cables, including the BNC/D-SUB connections and power cords, are properly connected. If the monitor displays "ghosting," it may require resettingâ€”turn it off, disconnect from the AC outlet, and utilize the RESET button.

**Note:** NEC advises users to properly configure the OSM (On-Screen Menu) settings for optimal performance, including increasing brightness and refresh rates if necessary. Ensure the monitor is compatible with the selected graphics output to avoid display issues.

### Cleaning the Touch Monitor

Before cleaning the LCD touch monitor, ensure that both the monitor and computer are turned off and unplugged from the AC power source. Use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently clean the screen, avoiding abrasive materials or strong cleaning agents. Ammonia-based cleaners should be avoided. If a service technician is required for cleaning or repairs, ensure compliance with safe practices.

To minimize electrical shock, always use a three-pronged power cord. This helps maintain a safe connection to the power outlet.

### Native LCD Specifications

The native resolution of the LCD touch monitor must match the input settings of the display. Standard resolutions include SVGA and XGA. Ensuring compatibility is crucial to prevent visual artifacts, like inconsistencies in displayed text.
