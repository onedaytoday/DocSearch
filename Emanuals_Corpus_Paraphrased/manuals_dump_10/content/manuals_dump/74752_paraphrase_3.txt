### Normal Operating Sounds
It is common to hear whirring or humming sounds from the cooling unit or during defrost cycles. Ensure food is stored properly to minimize disruption to airflow.

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply. Use a soft cloth without detergents or abrasive materials to avoid damaging surfaces. Never clean the inside of the appliance with harsh chemicals.
