**Warning!** Use the function for food thawing appropriately: Begin with food products left in the freezer for at least several hours. If food has been affected by frost, it should ideally be introduced to fresh, cold food (about 0°C) to slow spoilage or breakdown. 

**Hints:** Use polythene covers for non-cooked food and ensure that all dishes are clean. Food should be stored in airtight containers or wrapped securely. Bottles should be packed correctly. To maintain freshness, promptly remove frost and avoid freezer burn by correctly using polythene wrappers. To maximize food performance, minimize the time food remains outside the recommended conditions.

**Maintenance:** Only authorized technicians should perform maintenance and repairs. Ensure that the cooling unit remains clean and operates effectively. Regularly clean the surfaces and the back of the unit, adhering to the required cleanliness standards to maintain optimal performance. Be attentive to the cleaning process, especially around the cooling mechanisms.

**Defrosting:** Use the designated defrosting trough method, ensuring that frost buildup does not exceed a specified thickness. If the frost becomes too thick, power off the unit and manage the defrosting process as described without unnecessary delay.
