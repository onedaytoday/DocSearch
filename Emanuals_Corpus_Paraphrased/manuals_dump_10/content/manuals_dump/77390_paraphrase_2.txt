### Installation Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: When installing the Optical Slide Motor, first loosen the locking collar before sliding it down the shaft. Avoid using a screwdriver to force the locking collar into place.

**Overview**: The VDC is located in the housing, and the calibration is crucial for ensuring proper functionality. This documentation instructs users on the operational parameters.

**Note**: The actuator motor control module requires calibration, including the selection of the desired operating mode. If the device is completely powered off, ensure it is correctly mounted before proceeding with any adjustments. 

The wiring diagram shows the AC and DC connections, with external tie-wraps securing the setup. Inspect to ensure that connections from DC to AC are managed correctly, as improper connections can affect performance.

When adjusting the system, follow the calibration steps to accurately gauge and set output voltage levels. The LED will indicate operational states, lighting up to display 0V or 5V as appropriate during the calibration process.

**Calibration Process**: 
1. Disconnect the cover gently, ensuring you do not damage connected wires.
2. Access the LED indicator and monitor conditions.
3. Use the INC and DEC buttons to adjust the angular rotation of the actuator and observe real-time feedback.
4. Confirm successful calibration as indicated by the LED.

**Troubleshooting**: 
- If issues arise, verify connections at the optocouplers and other electrical components.
- Clean optocouplers and circuit boards to prevent electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- Ensure the thermal switch functions correctly and is not tripped from overheating.

Certain ambient conditions, like strong light, may impact operation, particularly if the cover is removed. Always consult with authorized personnel regarding thermal switch behavior. Any discrepancies must be rectified as this may void the warranty and affect performance.

**Important Reminder**: Modifications made without adherence to the specified guidelines may impact equipment efficacy and warranty coverage. Always prioritize proper calibration and installation practices to maintain optimal functioning.

### OIL SYSTEM

**A. Charging Procedure**
Charge the system as outlined in Section [X]. Ensure the receiver is charged adequately to maintain optimal heater operation. Monitor the sight glass closely; if the level drops below the lowest indicator, the suction operation could be compromised. Watch for the indicator to rise above the highest level during operation, as this could signal an issue.

**B. Maintenance Schedule**
For the first few hours of operation, perform checks as noted in the hour documentation. Subsequently, conduct maintenance every few months or when the system reaches specific thresholds, whichever comes first. To service the housing, ensure the VSG Units 1833C are isolated properly. Follow the necessary safety protocols during housing service. Open the cover by unscrewing it fully, and upon reassembly, ensure all components are tightly secured to maintain operational integrity.

**C. Coolant System Overview**
The system utilizes either water-cooled or air-cooled heat exchangers. The cooler is mounted locally and allows for bypassing as needed. Figure [X] presents a typical water-cooled oil cooler diagram. Ensure proper flow direction to avoid operational issues. The system should initially be installed with the flow direction correctly oriented to maintain efficiency.

**D. Electrical System**
The control panel operates on a feedback loop to monitor closed and open flow conditions, utilizing either 120V or 24V supplies. Ensure that during operation, the system permits efficient feedback to maintain conditions as required; this includes monitoring the injection cooling processes adequately.

**E. Restarting Protocol**
When restarting the system, ensure that all suction valves are correctly set before activating the On-Off switch. Maintain a close watch on system ratios and address any conditions that fall below the desired operating levels. Following the prescribed instructions for both manual and automatic operations is crucial.

Before commencing operations, verify all components are ready for service. Make sure that all items are checked off and documented in accordance with warranty service protocols. Trained Technicians should conduct these checks to ensure compliance with operational standards and ensure a smooth commissioning process.

### NOTE:
If a service has been acquired, the following items should be completed before the technician's arrival. Ensure financial matters are settled. All mounting and suction connections must be secure and adequately supported. The Stop/Check valve should be shipped and positioned appropriately according to guidelines to regulate downstream flow. Installation should comply with ASHRAE/ANSI standards related to Cooling Injection in dedicated systems. All high connections must lead to the Thermostatic V-PLUS to maintain functionality and suction stability. For thermosyphon coolers, connect to the front head; for water-cooled systems, use the same point. Ensure proper sight glass alignment for charging and that couplings are installed for field use, allowing sufficient clearance for technician access.

### FIELD WIRING REQUIREMENTS FOR UNITS WITH FACTORY-WIRED VISION MICROPROCESSORS:
If service is requested, the following tasks should be completed upon the technician's arrival. The units are factory pre-wired. The input voltage should be 208/230 VAC, 60 Hz, connected to the I/O board where L1 connects to the designated terminals. Ensure L1A connects to the N terminals and that the heaters are wired correctly to L2 and L3. With V-PLUS cooling, L1 and L1A must connect to their respective terminals. Isolate K-1 relay inputs accordingly to the top safety circuitry. Ensure proper wiring layout for relays and functionality checks are conducted, ensuring leads pass through the designated hubs clearly.

### PRE-STARTUP CHECKLIST FOR VRS/VSS/VSM SINGLE SCREW COMPRESSORS:
Confirm flow direction aligns with valve arrows and adjust settings as per the provided chart. Ensure that manual controls are positioned as required, allowing for appropriate suction flow.
