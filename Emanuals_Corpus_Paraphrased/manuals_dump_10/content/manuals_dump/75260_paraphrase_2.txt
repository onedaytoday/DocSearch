### Cooking Guidelines and Recommendations

**Recommended Cookware:**  
Utilize pans that match the cooking zones for efficiency. Traditional round-bottom cookware works best. Occasionally, temperatures may cause the appliance to cycle on and off to prevent overheating.

**Using the Second Oven and Grill:**  
Exercise caution when using the grill, particularly around children. The grill should be preheated for optimal performance. 

**Grilling Instructions:**  
For best results, position food centrally on the grill. Different food items may require varied cooking times and thicknesses, so consult the grilling chart for guidance.

### Baking and Cooking in the Second Oven

**Conventional Cooking:**  
The second oven operates by heating from the top and bottom. Pre-set the oven function and temperature as necessary. Monitor cooking times closely.

**Hot Air Cooking:**  
This mode allows cooking multiple dishes at once, promoting even heating. Preheat the oven as required for best results.

**Batch Baking:**  
The hot air function is effective for batch baking, allowing multiple trays of food to cook evenly.

### Maintenance and Tips

**Shelf Positioning:**  
Ensure that shelves are correctly placed to allow heat circulation for even cooking. For optimal results, follow the cooking chart and make adjustments based on personal experience. 

By adhering to these instructions and maintaining the appliance properly, cooking will be safer and more efficient.

### Adjusting Main Oven Shelves 

To position the oven shelves correctly, ensure they are straight and aligned toward the back of the oven. Each shelf should be easily accessible from the front to maintain a clear space. It's important to ensure that each shelf is supported by its designated wires. 

#### Tips and Guidelines 
When switching the oven on, count the shelves from the bottom upwards. For optimal cooking, position food on the central shelves to facilitate even heat distribution, especially for baked items like cakes. It's advisable to space the shelves appropriately depending on the type of food being cooked to enhance cooking efficiency.

### Conventional Oven Cooking 

This method allows for cooking without the fan mechanism and is ideal for dishes requiring top browning, such as gratins. 

To utilize conventional cooking, select the cooking function or press the cavity button, then confirm your choice after a few seconds. Set the temperature to 200°C. If the desired temperature is reached, the oven will indicate this, and you can switch off the function after one use. 

### Additional Information 
The interior light will indicate when the oven is heating, accompanied by a sound. If you need to reach a specific temperature more rapidly, consider using the Heat Function. 

#### Cooking Tips 
For better heat distribution, increase shelf spacing as needed. Positioning food centrally permits adequate airflow, reducing the need for extensive cleaning afterwards. Utilize heavy enamelware or polished cookware to enhance browning.

### Main Oven Cooking Chart 
Follow specific guidelines for food types, adjusting temperature as needed, such as an increase of 10°C for baking.

### Roasting Chart
Refer to the provided roasting chart for recommended times and internal temperatures for various meats at 160-180°C.

### Pizza Cooking 

For specialized cooking of pizzas, ensure the setup allows for optimal heat exposure. 

To initiate the pizza function, follow the same steps as conventional cooking, setting the temperature to 190°C, with sound indicators to confirm temperature. 

### Low-Temperature Cooking 

This setting gradually cooks meat, enhancing tenderness. Start by searing the meat at high heat, then switch to the low-temperature function, typically set between 120°C and 150°C.

### Fan Roasting 

This technique allows for consistent cooking of various dishes with the oven door closed, ensuring even baking and browning.

To use fan roasting, select the function and confirm your temperature setting. The interior-light will indicate progress.

### Grilling in the Main Oven 

When using the grill, ensure that food thickness is appropriate to achieve optimal results.

To activate grilling, set the function to 250°C, monitoring closely to avoid overcooking.

### Bottom Heat and Top Heat Browning 

Select these functions to control heat from either the bottom or top, as needed for specific dishes.

### Keep Warm Function 

This setting maintains serving temperatures for food, set at 80°C, ensuring dishes are warm until ready to serve.

All these functionalities ensure a varied cooking experience, promoting culinary creativity while maintaining optimal cooking conditions.

### DEFROST

This function allows foods to thaw without being exposed to heat, making it suitable for items that are covered in icing or frosting, such as cheesecakes. 

**USING DEFROST**  
Activate the Defrost function by pressing the corresponding button in the cavity. The selected option will be confirmed after a few seconds, and the temperature will be set to 30°C. To deactivate the function, press the button again. 

**NOTE**  
Be aware of the cooling and interior lighting during the defrosting process, as these can influence the effectiveness of thawing. Foods that are thicker or denser may take longer to defrost, while thinner items, such as minced meat or thin chops, usually require a few hours. Once thawed, cook the food thoroughly right away to avoid bacterial growth.

### FAST HEAT

This function allows for rapid preheating. 

**USING FAST HEAT**  
After selecting a cooking function, the cavity will begin heating up until the selected temperature is achieved. A flashing indicator and sound will confirm when the desired heat level is reached.

**NOTE**  
The Fast Heat function must be used in conjunction with a selected cooking function. 

### CARE AND CLEANING

Allow the appliance to cool before disconnecting it from the power supply. 

**CLEANING MATERIALS**  
Use appropriate cleaning agents that are recommended, avoiding any that contain bleach, as these may harm the finishes. Harsh materials should not be used on the appliance's exterior or surrounding areas.

**CLEANING THE EXTERIOR**  
Use a suitable cleaner, such as Brite or Brillo, on painted or surface-finished areas and clean with a soft cloth. Wipe off any residues immediately. 

**CLEANING HANDLES**  
Only use recommended cleaners, as other materials may dull the surface finish.

**REMOVING AND REPLACING WIREWORK RUNNERS**  
To remove shelves, unhook them from the top and take them out of the cavity. To reinstall, place them back securely in the cavity.

**CLEANING THE CERAMIC HOB**  
Wait until the hob is cool before cleaning. If something burns on, use Brite as needed to remove it. Daily cleaning with a suitable product is recommended.

**FOR STUBBORN MARKS**  
For tougher stains, use a non-stick scraper or similar tool, consulting specific cleaning instructions.

### HINTS AND TIPS TO REDUCE HOB SOILING  
To minimize burns, make sure to use proper cookware and avoid leaving the stove unattended. 

**CLEANING THE GRILL AND OVEN COMPARTMENTS**  
These areas may feature a Stayclean coating but still require manual cleaning. Use appropriate cleaners and follow the manufacturer's instructions.
