**English Translation**

Thank you for selecting our rechargeable cleaner for household use. This cleaner is designed for dry performance.

**Safety and Features**
The cleaner features an on/off switch and a charging indicator light. It’s crucial to ensure that children or individuals with reduced capabilities are monitored during usage. Only use the supplied charger that matches the specified rating on the unit’s housing. Avoid exposing the cleaner to excessive heat, strong sunlight, or contact with combustible materials like cigarettes or ashes. Repairs should only be conducted by authorized service centers, as any unauthorized work may void the warranty.

**Charging Station**
The cleaner comes with a charging station. It is essential to switch off the unit when it's placed in the station. The initial charging period should be around several hours to achieve full capacity. The cleaner is designed to be stored upright on the charging station.

**Operation Instructions**
Before using, ensure the charging station and its components are intact. The cleaner is equipped with suction capabilities, and the operation can be started and stopped with a button. 

**Emptying and Cleaning**
Once the suction indicator shows that the waste container is full, it needs to be emptied. To do this, gently release the container and dispose of the contents properly. Regular cleaning of the filter is advised, ideally after every third use. The components should be washed and reassembled carefully; some parts may be dishwasher safe.
