**E30DD75ESS E36DD75ESS E46DD75ESS E48DD75ESS Blower Assembly Dishwasher Instructions**

**IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**  
These instructions contain crucial safety guidelines. Failure to adhere to these could result in severe injury or death.

**SAFETY PRECAUTIONS**  
To minimize the risk of fire or electric shock, observe the following precautions: Ensure compliance with fire safety standards, including those set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). When servicing or cleaning, ensure that the power is switched off and the service is securely locked to prevent accidental activation. Ensure that the blower is thermally insulated to a minimum of R40. The ductwork should be solely for blower use to enhance fire safety.

To prevent grease fires, especially when cooking with high heat, maintain cleanliness by frequently cleaning cooking surfaces. If flames occur, extinguish by smothering with a lid and turn off the heat source. Avoid burning yourself, and if necessary, evacuate the premises and call emergency services. Do not attempt to extinguish flames with water, cloths, or inappropriate extinguishers. Always use a Class ABC fire extinguisher, and aim at the base of the fire.

**INSTALLATION PRECAUTIONS**  
The blower assembly is designed exclusively for E30DD75ESS, E36DD75ESS, E46DD75ESS, and E48DD75ESS models. Ensure that ducting is properly installed to maintain efficient airflow and performance. Ducts should be as straight as possible; use smooth turns where necessary and secure joints with screws. The installation must comply with relevant codes and standards, including ANSI/NFPA regulations.

**SPECIFICATION AND DIMENSION DETAILS**  
Refer to the provided specifications for blower dimensions and clearance requirements to ensure optimal operation.

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTION**  
Prior to installation, verify that the electrical supply matches specifications. Ensure grounding is properly established with the house supply wire. All electrical connections must comply with safety standards and local regulations.

**BLOWER INSTALLATION**  
Mount the blower using the recommended screws, and secure it through the housing. Follow the detailed instructions for operation after installation.

In case of installation issues, refer to the troubleshooting section applicable to models E30DD75ESS, E36DD75ESS, E46DD75ESS, and E48DD75ESS for guidance.
