### SANTO KA Upright Instructions

**User Instructions**  
Dear Customer, please review these operating instructions carefully. They provide essential information regarding the use and maintenance of your appliance. For detailed information, refer to the sections concerning operation, safety warnings, and functionality. Technical terms are explained in the "Technical Terminology" section. Additionally, users experiencing malfunctions should consult the “Something isn’t working” section. If issues persist, please contact AEG Service Force for assistance.

**Appliance Overview**  
The appliance's location is critical for optimal performance. It should be positioned away from direct sunlight and any heat sources. Ensure that there are no obstructions around the unit to allow proper airflow. The appliance should be installed in environments that maintain appropriate temperature ratings, as indicated on the product label (e.g., SN, N, ST, T).

**Electrical Safety**  
WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED. Ensure that your electrical supply corresponds with the appliance's specifications. The appliance comes with color-coded wiring: brown (live), blue (neutral), and green/yellow (earth). Proper connections must be made to avoid electrical hazards.

**Initial Setup**  
After installation, allow the appliance to remain powered on for several hours before initial use. Adjust the temperature settings using the ON/OFF switch and allow the unit to reach its optimal operating temperature.

**Temperature Control**  
To set the temperature, turn the dial with a coin to your desired level. The light will illuminate, indicating the appliance is functioning. High temperatures are recommended for efficient cooling.

**Defrosting Procedures**  
Frost build-up can occur, particularly at the rear of the appliance. Regular defrosting is necessary. When the frost is excessive, switch off the appliance, allowing the frost to thaw, which will be collected in the base and eventually evaporate.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Prior to cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the electrical supply. Use suitable cleaning products and ensure all surfaces are free from contaminants. Avoid abrasives that could damage the unit. Clean the interior and exterior surfaces thoroughly while ensuring that the cooling vents remain unobstructed.

**Operational Noises**  
Normal operational sounds include whirring and clicking. If unusual or loud noises occur, they may indicate a malfunction.

Please refer to this manual for any further assistance or contact AEG Service Force directly.

When issues arise with service, it often leads to excessively high temperatures. Frost may continuously form, affecting household appliances. If the lights in your home are not functioning properly, check to see if the food inside is obstructed or improperly stored. The light switch should be correctly positioned to allow airflow and heat. 

If your heater is malfunctioning, promptly contact the AEG Service Force. Customers should be aware of potential charges related to mechanical issues or breakdowns. This information pertains to purchase service symptoms, particularly regarding cooling functionalities and food preservation. 

Typically, heat is dissipated from the appliance to the external environment. The components are designed to be installed correctly, typically at the rear of the unit. Compliance with various regulations, including the GSG and VDE directives as well as EU legislation (73/23/EEC and 89/336/EEC), is mandatory.

AEG offers warranty coverage to the first purchaser for a specified period, covering defects in workmanship but excluding damage due to unauthorized repairs or misuse. Should repairs be necessary, it’s important for the purchaser to inform the designated service office. The responsibility for serviced parts will remain with AEG.

If relocating to another country within the EU, ensure that product details are in line with local regulations. For service inquiries, customers may contact AEG Service Force by phone or in writing. Please have your product identification number (PNC) readily available, which can usually be found on the appliance's rating plate.
