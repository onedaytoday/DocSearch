**Operational Guidelines:**

Avoid using unopened food items that may burst during heating. For models with electric ignition, ensure the unit is turned off when not in use. Use caution when handling pots and pans to prevent burns or fire hazards from grease buildup. 

Regularly clean the appliance to prevent grease accumulation. For self-cleaning ovens, ensure that no foreign objects are present, and protect the oven's coating.

By carefully adhering to these instructions, you can ensure safe and efficient operation of your appliance.

Here’s a technical paraphrase of the provided text while maintaining the original meaning:

To set the clock for the first time or after an interruption, press the button within seconds, and the self-cleaning or cooking function will appear. To adjust the cooking time, press the button repeatedly to increase the duration, which can be set from hours down to seconds. When the timer is activated, it will count down the seconds. The system can be reset to seconds if needed. If any other function is being utilized, it will be displayed accordingly.

To set the oven temperature, you can select a range from 170°F to 550°F (65°C to 287°C). Press the button to set the desired temperature, which defaults to "350°F (177°C)." Holding the button allows for adjustments in 5°F (1°C) increments. For continuous operations, an automatic shut-off function can be set for longer cooking periods. Once activated, a tone will indicate the completion of the cycle. 

The unit should not be operated while the indicator light is flashing and needs to cool down for about 30 seconds before locking. Once locked, the display will show the time remaining.

Cooking recommendations based on food types include reductions for meats, poultry, breads, and pizzas. Note that foods requiring temperatures below 250°F should be cooked at higher temperatures; this ensures rapid cooking by circulating heated air around the food. Preheating is crucial for specific items like cookies and cakes to achieve optimal results.

For manual cooking, ensure that food items are left uncovered; this facilitates evaporation of grease and moisture. In case of a fire, do not attempt to extinguish it with water; instead, use a fire extinguisher. 

The self-cleaning feature should be approached with caution; keep children away and monitor health and safety throughout the process. Follow guidelines for cleaning racks and avoid forcing any components. The self-cleaning function operates at high temperatures to thoroughly clean the interior, reducing residue to ash. 

Only use recommended cleaning products to maintain the appliance, as using abrasive materials can damage surfaces. Painted and decorative parts should be regularly cleaned with a soft cloth. The cooktop is not removable, and proper cleaning techniques should be followed to preserve its functionality.

Ensure that no substances enter the gas orifice holder, and always shut off the gas supply when servicing. Follow manufacturer instructions for maintenance, particularly regarding the cleaning of recessed areas and burner heads. Clean all parts carefully to prevent buildup and maintain safety during operation.

### Cleaning and Maintenance Instructions

This section outlines the proper procedures for cleaning and maintaining the factory appearance. When utilizing the self-cleaning feature, ensure that the oven temperature is set to 550°F (287°C). If the oven seems excessively hot or cool, adjust as needed. Monitor the temperature closely; adjustments of 35°F (17°C) may be necessary to retain appropriate functionality. The cleaning light will activate when the cleaning mode is turned on; this light is located behind a protective shield at the rear of the unit.

To maintain the shield, switch off the appliance and press to release it. Ensure proper protective gear is worn during service. 

### Troubleshooting Guide

If the cleaning light appears or there are issues with overheating or error codes (F1, F3, or F9), there may be several causes: ensure the appliance is well-ventilated and there are no obstructions. Any buildup of grease or food residue may require additional cleaning. Follow the cleaning instructions meticulously to prevent any issues with operation.
