### Important Safety Instructions:
**READ CAREFULLY AND RETAIN FOR FUTURE REFERENCE**  
To avoid fire hazards, do not operate the microwave at excessively high power settings or overheat food. Ensure that the outlet is easily accessible. If food catches fire while heating, do not open the door; instead, turn off the microwave and wait.

Use only microwave-safe materials. Clean the interior, turntable, and other components regularly to prevent grease buildup, which could ignite.

**Warning for Users with Pacemakers:**  
Consult your physician regarding the safe use of this microwave. 

If any malfunctions occur, disconnect the power supply immediately and seek assistance from authorized service personnel. Attempting repairs yourself can result in further issues or safety hazards.

### Operating Guidelines:
Use caution when microwaving sealed food items to prevent steam buildup. Follow cooking instructions closely to avoid scalding or burning food. During reheating, monitor items to avoid overheating and potential burns, especially when cooking eggs or shells. 

### Child Safety:
Prevent children from operating the microwave without supervision. Educate them about safe use to prevent injuries.

### Microwave Operation:
Microwaves work by generating waves that agitate food molecules, producing heat for cooking. As a result, food cooks faster than traditional methods. Avoid using materials that can cause arcing or uneven cooking results.

To ensure optimal performance, do not exceed the recommended cooking times, and always cover food to prevent splatters.

### Accessories and Initial Setup:
Included are accessories such as the turntable and necessary screws for assembly. Ensure the components are properly installed for safe operation.

### User Interface and Settings:
Follow the instructions to set the timer and cooking modes. In case of an interruption, settings may reset. If you need to stop the microwave, use the stop button to pause operations.

### Understanding Microwaves:
Microwaves create a specific electromagnetic frequency that heats food by agitating particles. This process allows for efficient cooking, defrosting, and reheating. It's crucial to understand how different materials interact with microwaves to avoid accidents.

### Conclusion:
For safe and efficient operation, adhere to the guidelines provided in this manual. Regular maintenance and attention to safety instructions ensure long-lasting performance of your microwave.

**AG-72D-UK ENGLISH User Instructions**

**Microwave Operation**: For efficient use, prepare food by microwaving it according to guidelines for defrosting, reheating, and cooking. It's essential to follow the recommended cooking times to avoid undercooking or overcooking.

**Defrosting and Reheating**: Begin with defrosting, using settings that typically involve lower temperatures (around 0°C). Adhere strictly to microwave instructions to prevent food from splattering or shells from bursting. 

**Cooking Methods**: Use a food thermometer to ensure that internal temperatures reach appropriate levels for safe consumption. For meat and fish, ensure that they become tender and easily separable from bones when cooked correctly. Foods should be covered to prevent splatters and ensure even heating.

**Cooking Techniques**: Adjust cooking times based on the quantity of food: for instance, double the amount of food often requires nearly double the cooking time. Use shallow containers to aid with even cooking, as round shapes generally heat more uniformly than square ones.

**Heat Distribution**: When microwaving, cover food to help retain moisture and allow microwaves to penetrate more effectively, avoiding overcooked edges and undercooked centers. Turn or rearrange food midway through cooking to ensure uniform heating.

**Defrosting Recommendations**: If foods are defrosted too quickly, adjust settings accordingly. Thicker items may need more time, and it’s crucial to avoid excessive temperatures that might lead to uneven cooking.

**Freshness and Flavoring**: Season foods as you normally would before cooking. When cooking high-temperature items, ensure they are cooked thoroughly for safe consumption.

**Microwave Functions**: 
1. **Grilling**: For grilling/browning, use the grill cooking option. Be cautious of high temperatures to prevent burning.
2. **Dual Grill**: Use this feature for simultaneous multiple cooking stages, adjusting settings as needed for each step.

For best results, follow these outlined procedures and adjust settings based on the nature and characteristics of the food.
