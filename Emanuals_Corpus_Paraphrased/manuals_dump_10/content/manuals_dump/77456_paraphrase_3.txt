This will automatically scan for the next available station. For FM stations, if the reception is good, the "STEREO" indicator will light up. If the FM signal is weak, switch to "MONO" mode. Adjust the volume to your preferred level. To stop listening, simply press the "STOP" button. Use headphones for better FM reception, ensuring they are properly connected.

Once tuned in, press the "MEMORY" button to save the station. While the station is displayed, press the "PRESET" button to choose a memory slot. Repeat the process to save additional stations. 

### To Recall Preset Stations

To recall your preset stations, turn the device on by pressing the "RADIO" button. Then, press the "PRESET" button to cycle through the saved stations and select the one you wish to listen to.

### Care and Maintenance

To clean the cabinet, use a soft cloth. If it's particularly dirty, slightly dampen the cloth and wipe it down. For cleaning the lens, if sound quality is affected, remove the CD cover and clean the lens as follows: use a brush or blower to remove dust, then gently wipe it with a soft cloth. For fingerprints, lightly clean the surface without applying excessive pressure. 

If the disc itself gets dirty, use a cleaning cloth to restore its condition. Avoid using harsh cleaners such as thinners or solvents.
