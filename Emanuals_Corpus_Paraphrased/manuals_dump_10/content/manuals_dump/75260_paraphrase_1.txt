For detailed timings and temperatures, refer to the specific cooking charts related to each food type to achieve optimal results.

### Fitting the Main Oven Shelves
To properly install the main oven shelves, position them straight and ensure they lean towards the back. Confirm that each shelf reaches fully into the oven and remains clear at the front for easy access. It is recommended to switch the oven on before adjusting the shelf heights. Count the shelves from the bottom upwards to allow for optimal heat circulation when cooking different types of food, such as cakes. It is advisable to maintain adequate space between racks for even cooking and better heat distribution.

### Conventional Main Oven Cooking
This cooking method utilizes conventional heating, ideal for dishes like gratins that require browning on top. To activate this function, press the appropriate button on the control panel for a few seconds until your selection is confirmed. Adjust the temperature to 200°C. Once the desired temperature is reached, deactivate the function as needed. 

#### Important Notes:
The interior light will activate indicating that the oven is heating up. If an audible sound occurs, it signifies that the set temperature has been achieved. If the heat needs to be reached more quickly, use the Heat Function mentioned previously. 

### Cooking Tips
When cooking, ensure the food is placed centrally on the shelf for even heat distribution. Employ higher shelf positions for dishes like Yorkshire pudding that require more heat from above. Avoid cramming too much food onto the shelves to facilitate easy cleaning and even cooking. 

### Main Oven Cooking Chart & Roasting Guide
Refer to the cooking chart for specific temperature settings and placement recommendations for various food items, including pastry and roast dishes. For optimal results, follow the guidelines provided.

### Pizza Cooking

Low-temperature cooking is ideal for tenderizing meat and retaining moisture. Sear meat initially at high heat if needed, then use the low-temperature option, setting it between 120°C and 150°C. 

#### Important Notes
Keep an eye on the indicator light and sounds to confirm when the selected temperature is reached. 

### Fan Roasting
This method circulates air around food, cooking it more evenly at closed temperatures. Adjust settings for specific dishes such as shepherd’s pie, ensuring to follow appropriate cooking times as indicated.

### Main Oven Grill
To utilize the grill, activate the function and set to 250°C. Pay close attention to the instructions regarding the positioning of food to achieve optimal browning.

### Keeping Warm
This setting maintains a consistent temperature, around 80°C, ideal for warming plates or food without further cooking. 

In all cases, monitor the interior light and sounds to ensure proper operation.

### DEFROST FUNCTION

The Defrost function uses ambient temperature to thaw food without applying heat. It is designed for items covered in frost, such as assorted cheesecakes. **How to Use Defrost**: Activate the Defrost function by selecting it from your cooking options. Adjust the cavity temperature to 30°C. To turn off the function, simply press the button once. Monitor the interior lighting throughout the defrosting process, as cooling can affect the efficiency of thawing. Defrosting time may vary based on the food's state; thinner items will thaw faster, while larger cuts may take several hours. Once defrosted, ensure to cook food thoroughly or refrigerate if not immediately cooked to prevent bacterial growth.
