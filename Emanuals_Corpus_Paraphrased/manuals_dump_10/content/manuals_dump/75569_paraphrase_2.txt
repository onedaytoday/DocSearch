### Important Instructions for Use and Care

**Congratulations on Your Purchase**  
Thank you for choosing our product. Please read and retain these instructions, which provide important information about features, cleaning, and warranty coverage.

**Safety Precautions**  
1. **Installation and Servicing**: Ensure installation is performed by a qualified technician according to local codes (ANSI/NFPA and CSA C22.1 Part 1). Only authorized service personnel should conduct repairs and servicing to minimize hazards.
   
2. **Child Safety**: Keep children away from the appliance during operation and prohibit them from reaching items on or near the cooktop to prevent burns or accidents.

3. **Avoid Touching Heating Elements**: Surfaces, including heating elements and oven interiors, can become extremely hot. Use care when handling such parts, as they may cause burns.

4. **Fire Safety**: In case of a fire involving grease, smother flames with a lid or use a foam-type extinguisher. Do not use water, as it can worsen grease fires.

**Operating Guidelines**  
- **Cooktop Use**: Always ensure that cookware covers burners adequately. Adjust the heat settings based on the cooking requirements. Use protective gear to prevent burns or shocks.
  
- **Oven and Warmer Use**: Ensure that airflow ducts are unobstructed when using the oven or warmer to avoid overheating. Be cautious of heat-sensitive items nearby.

**Cleaning Instructions**  
1. **Regular Cleaning**: Keep surfaces free from grease buildup to prevent fire hazards. Follow manufacturer-recommended cleaning procedures and use appropriate cleaning agents.

2. **Self-Cleaning Ovens**: Refer to your owner's manual for specific cleaning guidelines. Ensure racks and protective coatings are maintained during the self-cleaning process.

3. **Cooktop Specifics**: Clean glass cooktops carefully with non-abrasive cleaners to avoid scratches.

**Bridge Functionality**

The Bridge is located at the front and is essential when cooking with specific cookware. Both the Bridge and the cookware interact for efficient operation. Heat is generated only by the correct use of the Bridge, which requires certain adjustments. To cook properly, cookware must be turned counterclockwise or clockwise based on its type. 

Once cooking is finished, turn the cookware off, and the indicator light will signify when it's cool. The light remains on until the cookware cools down completely. Recommended practices include avoiding contact with hot surfaces and waiting until the Bridge is off before touching any components.

When selecting cookware, ensure compatibility with the heating mechanism. Materials such as aluminum transfer heat well but may scratch easily. Copper heats quickly, while stainless steel is durable and easy to clean. Cast iron retains heat but requires careful management. Porcelain enamel and glass are generally not advised for this type of cooking due to their scratching potential.

**Oven Operation and Safety**

Always position oven racks while the oven is cool before operation. Be cautious of the oven vent, ensuring nothing obstructs the airflow as heat rises from the front. Recommended oven rack positions vary based on the type of cooking, such as broiling, baking, or roasting.

**Food Warmer Usage**

The food warmer can be adjusted to accommodate dishes, allowing food items to rest both on top and within the warmer. It is advisable to cover food for optimal heating. Always use potholders to prevent burns when handling hot cookware.

For optimal performance, utilize the Warmer settings: HI, MED, and LO, with quick access via touch controls. The warmer light indicates the heating status and should be monitored to avoid overheating.

**Cooking Guidelines**

Observe ideal cooking parameters to prevent uneven heating. Preheat as necessary and maintain recommended temperatures to ensure optimal food preparation. Avoid overcrowding to facilitate even heat distribution.

When cooking meat or fatty foods, do not leave grease exposed, as it can pose a fire hazard. Fire safety measures include keeping a fire extinguisher close and knowing how to deal with kitchen fires.

**Cleaning Instructions**

Routine cleaning is essential to minimize buildup and ease future maintenance. Attend to spills promptly, and use soft cloths to avoid scratching surfaces. Adhere strictly to manufacturer's cleaning guidelines and avoid using abrasive materials or harsh chemicals on the cooking surface. Be aware of materials that can scratch or damage the appliance during cleaning.

For deeper cleaning, use appropriate cleaners like CERAMA BRYTE for surfaces that may require more attention. Follow safety instructions during the self-cleaning process, ensuring the appliance is cool before starting.

This summary provides guidelines to maintain, operate, and clean your cooking appliances effectively while ensuring safety and efficiency.

**Self-Cleaning Oven Instructions**

The self-cleaning feature uses high temperatures to effectively eliminate food residues, simplifying the cleaning process. After the cycle, allow the oven to cool down before starting manual cleaning. Always wear protective gear during manual cleaning, and avoid forcing components that are designed to lock during the self-cleaning process.

Avoid placing materials that are not heat-resistant inside the oven during the self-cleaning cycle, as they may get damaged. Always ensure the oven is cool before handling any parts, and refer to the self-cleaning section for specific cleaning instructions.

**Light and Glass Shield Precautions**

Ensure the glass shield is in place whenever the oven is in operation, and take caution only to work on a cool oven. If servicing the internal light, cover it with a cloth to avoid scratches. Follow the recommended procedures to remove the glass shield safely.

**Warmer Usage Guidelines**

When operating the warmer, turn it off and ensure both the latch and the surface are clear. If cleaning is necessary, use non-abrasive materials. Avoid using harsh cleaners as they may damage the warmer’s surface.

**Service and Warranty Information**
