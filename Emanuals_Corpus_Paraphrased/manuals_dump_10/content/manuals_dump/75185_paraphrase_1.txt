### Important Safety Instructions
To minimize risks of fire and electric shock, adhere to the following guidelines:
1. Ensure proper installation in compliance with national codes, such as ANSI/NFPA or CSA standards.
2. Before connecting the appliance to power, allow it to stabilize at 0°C/32°F for at least one hour.
3. Only qualified technicians should perform servicing. Avoid removing appliance covers to prevent serious risks.
4. Keep flammable materials (e.g., cloth, cookbooks, plastics) away from the appliance.
5. Keep children away from the appliance when in use. Do not allow them to operate or tamper with it.

Avoid touching the interior oven elements or surfaces until they have cooled, as they may cause burns. Use caution in case of grease or water fires; smother flames with a suitable extinguisher and never attempt to extinguish them with water.

Make sure vents and ducts remain unobstructed during operation to prevent burns. Do not operate the oven when heat-sensitive items are near.

### Cleaning Instructions
Regular cleaning is essential to avoid grease build-up that could ignite. For self-cleaning models, follow the manufacturer's guidelines.

### Getting Started
Ensure oven racks are arranged appropriately before turning on when the appliance is cool. Follow self-cleaning procedures as indicated. 

### Control Pad Functions
Understanding the control panel functions:
- **Convection & Bake Settings**: Used for roasting and preheating.
- **Cleaning Controls**: Activate the self-cleaning function.
- **Light Control**: Turns the oven light on/off.

### Setting the Clock
To set the clock after a power interruption or upon first use, press the designated buttons until the desired time is displayed. The clock can be set to either a 12-hour or 24-hour format.

### Kitchen Timer & Lockout Feature
To set the timer, use the indicated controls. To activate the lockout feature for safety, follow the specific button sequence to ensure the oven is secure when not in use.

### Adjusting Temperature Display
To toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius, use the appropriate buttons as per the guide. Factory settings can be changed to suit individual preferences.

### Silent Control Operation
To enable silent operation, adjust the settings accordingly. 

### Temperature Adjustment
If you find the oven temperature is inaccurate, you can fine-tune it using the control panel, increasing or decreasing as needed.

### Preheating Instructions
To preheat the oven to 350°F, follow the indicated steps for optimal results. 

For detailed usage and maintenance instructions, refer to the complete manual.

### Cooking Instructions Overview

For optimal results when baking breads, cakes, or during roasting, preheat your oven to the required temperature as indicated in the cooking chart. Ensure that the oven is not overcrowded, as this can cause uneven cooking or warped food. Allow the oven to preheat fully before placing food inside. When adjusting the temperature, avoid exceeding a difference of 25°F (12°C) above the recommended setting.

### Convection Baking

Convection baking circulates heated air around the food for even cooking. This method is effective for both cooking and roasting. Adjust cooking times and temperatures based on the food type and quantity. Preheat as necessary to achieve optimal results, and utilize the recommended reduction for cooking times when using convection.

#### Instructions for Convection Baking
1. Set the oven to 350°F.
2. Press the "PRE" button to begin preheating.
3. Wait for the internal temperature to reach the desired setting; a sound will indicate it's ready.

### Timed Bake and Timed Convection Bake

To set a timed bake, input the desired cooking time and temperature, and the oven will automatically turn off once completed. Select the appropriate racks for your food. 

#### Instructions for Timed Bake
1. Set the oven to 350°F.
2. Input the desired cooking time.
3. Start the process, and the oven will notify you when it's done.

### Delayed Timed Bake and Delayed Timed Convection Bake

If you wish to delay the start of cooking, set the timer accordingly. Ensure that the total cooking time does not exceed the available hours.

#### Instructions for Delayed Bake
1. Set the desired temperature and cooking time.
2. Ensure the oven is prepped and racks are adjusted.
3. Confirm the settings before initiating the cycle.

### Broiling

For broiling meat, preheat the oven to achieve a red-hot heating element, typically around 550°F. Follow specific guidelines for timing and flipping to ensure thorough cooking, taking care not to cover food to prevent grease fires.

#### Broiling Instructions
- Preheat the oven.
- Place food directly on the broiling rack.
- Monitor closely to avoid flare-ups, and do not leave the oven unattended.

### Cleaning with Self-Clean Feature

Utilize the self-clean feature periodically to maintain oven health. Avoid using harsh cleaners or protective coatings during this process. The self-cleaning function uses extreme heat to eliminate food residue.

#### Instructions for Self-Cleaning
1. Ensure the oven is empty and cool before initiating.
2. Choose the light or heavy cleaning cycle based on the level of soiling.
3. Wait for the cleaning light to indicate completion.
4. Once cooled, remove any remnants left in the oven.

### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle

To activate the self-clean feature, ensure the oven is shut and any additional settings are confirmed. 

#### Self-Clean Cycle Instructions
1. Press the appropriate settings for light or heavy cleaning.
2. Monitor the "DOOR LOCKED" indicator for safety.
3. Wait until the cycle completes and the oven cools before accessing.

### Delayed Self-Clean Cycle

For delayed cleaning, set the timer as needed before starting the self-clean cycle, ensuring to adjust for the level of soiling and cleaning intensity. 

### Final Precautions

Always allow the oven to cool and ensure safety measures are in place during self-cleaning. Keep children away from the appliance during the operation. Follow all cleaning instructions as outlined and never attempt to bypass safety features.

### General Cleaning

Ensure appliances are turned OFF and COOL before cleaning. Promptly address spills and heavy soiling. Consistent cleaning minimizes the need for intensive cleanings later on. For painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces, use a soft cloth. Avoid abrasive cleaners that may scratch these surfaces. Apply a gentle cleaner, and wipe lightly with a cloth or towel. Avoid scouring pads; they can permanently damage finishes. If stubborn residues persist, cover them with a recommended cleaner and let it sit before wiping with a cloth.

For the oven light shield, follow specific steps for cleaning and maintenance. 

### Important Notes

If the oven control beeps and displays error codes such as F1 to F10, use the CANCEL button to clear the message or consult an authorized service technician. If F8 appears, address any issues with the self-cleaning process as indicated. 

If the oven becomes non-operational, check the power supply and ensure the cord is properly connected. Address anything related to house wiring, such as blown fuses or tripped breakers, especially after installation.
