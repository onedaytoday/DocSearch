To turn off the thermostat, switch off the unit or disconnect it from the power supply. Thoroughly defrost and clean the appliance, ensuring to remove ice buildup. Store fresh food appropriately by maintaining a temperature of -18°C or colder. It's essential to adhere to the specified capacity ratings and timelines for food freshness. Allow cooked food to cool before placing it inside. Be aware that expanding liquids in bottles can cause them to burst, so ensure proper packaging. 

When handling food, be careful of overcrowding and ensure that it does not obstruct the airflow within the appliance. Items should be organized according to type, and excess frost should be defrosted to maintain optimal performance.
