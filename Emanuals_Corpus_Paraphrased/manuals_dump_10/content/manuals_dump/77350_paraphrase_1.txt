Ensuring the correct attachment of LUNs and that BIOS settings are accurately configured is essential for successful operation across different EMC systems, including Symmetrix and VNX architectures.

The BIOS setup involves a Storage Area Network (SAN) connected with an IDE CD-ROM and integrated SCSI functionalities. The SCSI BIOS can operate from the CD-ROM, while the boot process can be executed from various sources, including the SAN. Configuration is done via the BIOS, where devices are prioritized based on their PCI slot numbering. Typically, the BIOS displays options where the lowest-numbered PCI device is given precedence.

When the system boots, it may show connected devices and their corresponding BIOS revisions. If only one device appears, it should be noted, as it indicates success in recognizing that hardware. EMC devices connected to specific PCI slots will be detected first, particularly the EMC Fibre Channel (FC) devices. 

Further configuration is performed using the Unisphere/Navisphere interface or through Command Line Interface (CLI) to allocate Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs) effectively. The EMC recommends ensuring that the host's HBA (Host Bus Adapter) is correctly configured with the appropriate WWPN (World Wide Port Name) and that the LUN is easily accessible through the storage group.

For systems running RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) or SLES (SuSE Linux Enterprise Server), the OS installation can utilize specific disks or images as sources. Instructions typically include selecting options from the boot menu, confirming selections, and proceeding with installation prompts.

Networking components and configurations should be calibrated through the BIOS and integrated with the SAN, where adapting components may require rebooting to reflect changes. Lastly, maintaining consistency in configurations across SPs (Storage Processors) is a practice recommended by EMC for optimal performance and reliability.

The BIOS for SAN SCSI enables communication with SCSI devices connected to the operating system, including SCSI CD-ROMs. The BIOS supports both integrated SCSI and IDE CD-ROM drives. Additionally, it allows booting from various Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) and EMC storage arrays, facilitating both internal and SAN-based boot options.

If assistance is needed in configuring the SAN BIOS, the Flas!UTIL utility can be utilized. To access the BIOS, reboot the system and press CTRL-Q when prompted. The BIOS interface will show the HBAs currently connected, including specific versions for EMC devices.

Upon loading the BIOS, navigate through the provided options by pressing ENTER. If there are multiple HBAs, the one with the lowest PCI number will typically be selected first. From this interface, users can modify settings, choose the appropriate LUN, and interact with Unisphere/Navisphere software to manage host connectivity.

When dealing with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), it is crucial to ensure that the LUNs are adequately allocated and that the operating system is fully operational. To create a boot disk for RHEL, specific instructions must be followed, including matching kernel versions and correctly configuring drivers.

For systems using Intel-based or AMD Opteron architectures, proper LUN allocation is recommended to facilitate seamless OS installation. The IQN of the HBA can be found in the BIOS and is vital for establishing correct connections. The setup process relies heavily on adhering to guidelines regarding the installation and integration of the EMC storage with the operating host.

### EMC VNX Connectivity with FC, HBAs, and CNAs

This section discusses EMC VNX systems, focusing on Intel-based and AMD Opteron-based configurations. It is recommended to access the VNX LUN through Unisphere/Navisphere or CLI. Ensure that the LUN is bound to the SP connected to the HBA for straightforward installation and association with the host's group. When creating LUNs, use Unisphere/Navisphere to specify the LUN type and maintain storage processor (SP) consistency.

Always utilize the lowest-numbered PCI slot for the HBA and reboot the system accordingly to establish correct configurations. Ensure that the BIOS is set to recognize the SAN and SCSI settings, disconnect any installations before booting from the SAN, and include CD-ROM drives properly in the BIOS settings.

If multiple HBAs are present, the system will recognize the lowest-numbered PCI HBA first. Follow prompts to configure and manage the attached LUNs, ensuring the host is appropriately linked to the EMC VNX or its equivalent. Manual configuration of the host's HBA may be necessary, and using Unisphere/Navisphere for such tasks is advised.

### Additional Notes on Ethernet and FC Connectivity
