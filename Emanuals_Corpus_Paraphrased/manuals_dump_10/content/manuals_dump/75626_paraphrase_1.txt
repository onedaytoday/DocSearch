**Wave-Touch™ System Overview:** 

The Wave-Touch™ system interfaces with community practices, including religious observances. Please note that while the Wave-Touch™ feature allows for ON and OFF controls by pressing and holding both buttons for several seconds, it maintains health functionalities by showing indicators when in High mode. In High mode, a sound is emitted, and the unit will revert to normal operation once closed, independent of Sabbath or holiday restrictions. For further assistance, refer to the manual. 

It’s essential to deactivate the lights when not needed to conserve energy and avoid potential recovery issues. The Custom™ feature must be switched OFF before any modifications to prevent malfunction. Ensure regular cleaning and maintenance of components such as the ice water supply to enhance performance.

**Ice Water Supply Precautions:**

To avoid malfunctions, the ice water supply must remain operational; it’s advisable to hold the On/Off button for three seconds to turn it off correctly. After filling with water, allow it to cool for a minimum of three hours to achieve optimal performance. Ensure the unit remains factory settings compliant, as improper handling can cause system chattering.

**Water Supply Management:**

When the water supply is inactive, it can be reactivated by pressing the On/Off button for three seconds. Notification sounds may occur during the water filling or closing phases. For optimal functionality, avoid using chemical cleaners and ensure manual flushing if necessary.

**Shelf Organization:**

The Custom™ shelves are designed for easy adjustment and can accommodate a variety of food items securely. Regularly check and clean these shelves to ensure they function correctly, preventing overcrowding which can hinder cooling efficiency.

**Temperature Control:**

The Custom™ feature allows flexibility for meat and various food items. Settings can be adjusted between 28°F and 42°F to suit specific needs. The control buttons facilitate easy modification of temperatures.

**Cleaning Instructions:**

Do not use abrasive cleaners on the Custom™ cover; instead, a soft cloth is recommended. Keep the unit off during cleaning for safety. Regular maintenance will improve freshness and functionality.

**Sound Indicators:**

Normal operational sounds include hissing from the defrost heater and other high-efficiency sounds, indicating proper function. If unusual sounds persist, check for any blockages or malfunctions.

**Water Filtration and Maintenance:**

The PureAdvantage™ water filter is certified for health standards by NSF International. Regularly replacing the filter will maintain water quality. Follow guidelines for activating the system to ensure appropriate water release and performance.

For further questions, please consult the user manual for comprehensive guidance.

The Water and TM cartridge should produce audible clicks when functioning properly. To activate, turn on the device, press the designated button on the housing for three seconds, ensuring the water supply is connected as previously instructed. For maintenance, assist the Water TM cartridge located on the front and ensure replacement every few months, as indicated by the status light.

When unpacking, remove any accumulated dust or food particles to maintain the unit’s performance and aesthetics. Avoid using harsh cleaning agents such as scouring cleansers, bleach, or abrasive tools which could damage the appliance.

To deactivate the cooling system or lighting, simply turn off the related switches and allow the system to rest. Note that scratching surfaces could void warranties, so be careful during cleaning. For any necessary service or operational issues, be sure to consult the product manual.

Regular cleaning with appropriate cloths is recommended to minimize buildup. During vacations lasting longer than a month, ensure to power down the cooling compartment and remove perishable items.

For LED lights, make sure they are correctly installed and facing toward the fresh food section. If not illuminating, check the connections and cleanliness of the housing components. Always wear protective gloves when handling electrical parts.

If there are issues with the water supply, ensure it is properly connected, and perform routine checks to prevent clogs or malfunctions. Additionally, verify that food items are not overloaded, as this can affect cooling efficiency.

In case of temperature-related issues, such as food freezing or insufficient cooling, adjustments may be necessary. Remove any ice buildup and consider the ambient conditions affecting appliance performance.

Finally, for any concerns regarding frost or moisture accumulation, check that the water supply is not obstructed and that the unit is correctly connected. Regular checks and cleaning will help maintain optimal function and prevent water damage.
