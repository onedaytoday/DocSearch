**Chillers GN Overview**

Electrolux chillers efficiently lower the temperature of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, thereby inhibiting bacterial growth. These units not only chill food to +3°C but also maintain it at that temperature without compromising food safety.

**Operating Modes**

The chillers offer several operational settings, including Soft Chilling (down to 2°C) and standard Chilling (down to 20°C). The ARTE mode continuously monitors and controls the cooling process, with options for defrosting and built-in UV sanitization (available as an accessory). The user interface displays countdown timers and service information, and maintains records related to HACCP compliance, especially in cases of abnormal terminations.

**Performance**

The chillers are designed to chill food from +90°C to +3°C and can vary in performance based on food density and type.

**Construction**

The chillers feature a robust AISI finish with high-density polyurethane insulation, which is HCFC-free. They comply with ISO standards and are designed with rounded corners for easy cleaning. The construction includes IP20 protection against dust.
