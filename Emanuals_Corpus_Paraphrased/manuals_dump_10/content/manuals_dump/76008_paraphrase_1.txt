When operating equipment, it is vital to adhere to safety guidelines. This includes using protective gear such as helmets and hearing protection as outlined in the operating instructions. Users must be adequately trained and should follow directions carefully to minimize risks. 

Inspect equipment regularly to ensure proper assembly and identify any potential malfunctions. If any components—like screws or heads—appear worn or damaged, they should be replaced immediately. Do not operate the brush cutter without ensuring that the safety guard for the cutting device is securely in place. 

Avoid using the device if you feel unwell or fatigued, as this increases the risk of accidents. Proper clothing and footwear are essential, and users should avoid loose-fitting garments that could get caught in moving parts. 

While operating, keep a safe distance from others and ensure that the work area is free of any hazards. Pay attention to the position of the cutting head and maintain the correct posture. 

To prevent fires, switch off the equipment when not in use. Additionally, ensure the machine is cool before refueling or performing maintenance. Regular maintenance and appropriate usage will enhance safety and operational efficiency. 

Follow all assembly and disassembly instructions carefully. Secure connections firmly and ensure all components are positioned correctly to avoid mechanical issues. When using attachments, always refer to the specifications provided for compatibility and safety.

Take special care to align parts correctly during assembly and to keep the workspace clean and organized to reduce the risk of fire and injury. If necessary, consult professional service for any repairs or maintenance tasks that might be beyond your expertise.

**Washer Locking Screw Assembly:** The assembly of the washer locking screw involves integrating the sawtooth with its head. To secure or release the assembly, rotate the screw clockwise; this will cause a consistent motion. Conversely, rotating the screw counterclockwise will initiate the release mechanism. 

**Operational Guidelines:** Ensure the stop switch (F1) is set to 'I' (START) before engaging the process. The flow should be managed evenly without obstruction. It’s essential to have this assembly serviced exclusively by authorized personnel to maintain optimal performance levels. 

**Assembly Procedure:** As indicated, fasten the screw clockwise until it rotates smoothly. If the assembly needs to be engaged, ensure the throttle is released (refer to F4, F3) before switching to 'O' (STOP). 

**Routine Maintenance:** Perform cleaning regularly to prevent overheating and maintain performance. In cases of excessive grease buildup, thorough cleaning is recommended every few hours of use. Pay special attention to the areas around the cover to ensure they remain clear of debris. 

**Safety Precautions:** Always wear a backpack correctly, distributing weight appropriately between the hips and shoulders. Follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding any adjustments to avoid compromising safety or performance. 

**Cutting Operations:** During operation, ensure the cutting head does not excessively contact the ground, as this can lead to wear and decreased performance. Adjust the throttle release to maintain optimal cutting height. 

**Troubleshooting & Repairs:** If the assembly becomes worn, it may require complete replacement. For any ID-related doubts or issues, consult the manual. KICKBACK safety is crucial; do not allow the sawtooth to touch the ground, as this can lead to accidents or further damage.

**Conformity Declaration:** The products BC011 and BC012 from E.O.P., Italy, comply with directives 98/37/EEC, 93/68/EEC, and 89/336/EEC, relating to product safety and environmental considerations. Please adhere to the recommended operational guidelines for safe usage.
