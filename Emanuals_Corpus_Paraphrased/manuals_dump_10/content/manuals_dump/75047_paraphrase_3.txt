### Cooking and Preheating Instructions

**Chart Overview:**
The chart includes recommendations for preheating various types of dishes such as cakes (e.g., apple cake, Christmas cake, meringues), pastries (e.g., choux pastry), bread, pizza, and meat dishes (e.g., shoulder of lamb, whole pheasant). Specific fish options include trout and salmon. 

Preheating is essential for optimal cooking results. If a dish requires a longer cooking time than specified on the chart, adjust the cooking duration accordingly. Ensure that the thermostat is set as per the guidelines. The chart provides specific cook times based on the food's thickness and type.

**Thermal Cooking:**
The thermal cooking function utilizes the principle of circulating heat around the food, which may decrease cooking time. When using this function, set the thermostat to 200°C and follow the preheating instructions provided in the chart.

**Defrosting:**
The defrosting function operates without heat, which accelerates thawing. It is suitable for foods like ice cakes and yeast products. Always cover the food while defrosting and remember to cook it thoroughly after thawing.

Please follow the provided instructions carefully. Ensure that the cavity dimensions comply with the specified height and width, and that the oven is properly connected to a grounded electrical supply. It is essential that this oven is earthed. Use outlets that meet the following specifications: butyl-insulated PVC/PVC, and earth only types H07 RN-F, H05 RN-F, H05 RR-F, H05 VV-F, H05 V2V2-F (T90), or H05 BB-F. 

The oven’s heating features include thermal convection and light cooling convection, which should be managed by the designated switch. Ensure that the switch and earth connections are correctly established, with the yellow and green earth wire connected securely and positioned below other wires. When connecting, ensure that temperatures do not exceed 50°C, and verify that all components are properly earthed. 

It is crucial that these requirements are adhered to in order to prevent any potential mishaps. Make sure that the surrounding building materials are constructed to withstand an increase in temperature of at least 50°C to avoid overheating. 

For installation, use four screws to secure the oven in its recess, ensuring that it meets all necessary specifications.
