**IM-106-5500 Instruction on CCO Power Supply Voltage Selection**

To activate the power supply, ensure the supply switch is in the ON position. Confirm that both the LED and LCD indicators are operational. If alignment is satisfactory, examine the built-in diagnostics and the functionality of the supply unit. 

With the supply turned OFF, remove the four screws securing the supply cover. Select the desired voltage through the switch while monitoring the temperature, ensuring it reaches the WAITING FOR REFERENCE state. Once the reference is detected, the LCD will display STABILIZING REF, and the reference ratio will appear at the top of the screen. Complete this step before proceeding. To ensure accuracy during this process, check that the necessary readings are visible.

Next, proceed to Configuration Mode by pressing the MODE button and then ENTER to set up the security features. The factory settings should be evident, and you can navigate using the arrow keys. For calibration, access the CALIBRATE option and then the DISPLAY DETECTOR LEVELS. The outputs D1 and D2 will display.

Assess values affecting D1 and D2 through preliminary testing. If values are below maximum, adjustments may be needed. If necessary, increase the settings towards optimal levels to ensure functionality.

**CCO Detector Levels**

The placement of the detector affects measurement accuracy. If the path length is outside specified ranges, adjustments are required. Monitor D1 and D2 for optimal operation. Ensure that settings reflect maximum levels for each detector. Complete necessary calibrations in conjunction with other adjustments to guarantee performance.

**Transmitter Adjustments**

To adjust the transmitter, access the cover to examine and modify settings related to the light intensity. Secure the cover once adjustments are made, ensuring proper synchronization of the operating parameters. If readings indicate high opacity, reduce D2 settings appropriately.

To maintain compliance with operational standards, complete diagnostic checks. Use the input options provided to fine-tune performance parameters. Follow specified sequences for configuration using the ENTER button to confirm selections.

**Operational Notes**

For normal operation, it is recommended to review the factory settings and ensure all parameters are accurately configured. Custom settings should be documented to reflect any modifications made from original specifications.

During the calibration process, ensure that all measurements are taken while terminals are disconnected to prevent erroneous readings. Verify IDs and parameters via the security features to maintain system integrity.

**Final Summary**

Constant monitoring of detector factors, path lengths, and security settings is critical for maintaining efficient operation. Adjustments should be executed using the outlined instructions, with all system changes logged for future reference.

**Instruction IM-106-5500, CCO**

This instruction outlines the operational thresholds for input selection. Users can choose from three types of inputs. The appropriate input threshold must be set, and based on the selected option, if the PS1 and PS2 terminals are engaged, the system will toggle appropriately between ON and OFF states. Users should press ENTER when this option is displayed. Selecting an input option allows for confirmation through YES or NO choices, which can be navigated using the arrow keys.

When below the designated threshold, the system will deactivate (OFF). Conversely, if conditions are above the threshold, the system remains activated (ON). Users must confirm the selected options, and the system reflects these choices before proceeding. 

For the Water Threshold Detector, pressing ENTER prompts confirmation of the parameters. It's crucial that input units are within recommended settings for accuracy, ensuring that measurements are continuously and precisely captured. Input conditions should be validated to reflect whether the system is in a WET or DRY state.

During calibration, it's vital to record the 'CAL FACTOR' by pressing ENTER. Any anomalies should be reported to Rosemount Analytical. Detectors D1 and D2 must display calibrated figures appropriately for operational integrity. 

In commissioning, note that the calibration factor should be documented once established. During calibration and testing, it's necessary to adhere to operational guidelines and times as specified in the options table.

When conducting calibration, record how the system operates over seconds and factor settings. Use appropriate pathways for setup to establish zero output and verify the calibration factors for the detector components.

The system's operational parameters and modes must be accurately managed through the CCO's interface, ensuring secure and effective functionality. The LCD provides status readouts and allows users to navigate easily through operation modes.

In summary, accurate setup and ongoing verification of inputs, outputs, and calibration factors are essential for the effective operation of the CCO system, as outlined in this instruction.
