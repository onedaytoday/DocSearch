If the device is switched off or extinguished, adhere to the following procedure: first, set the device to minimum. Locate the screw at the back or right side of the unit. Use a thin screwdriver to hold the screw steady and adjust from minimum to maximum. This testing should be conducted with the front and crown of the injector in place. Turn on the gas supply and another supply line, ensuring the reading is stable. Once confirmed, turn off the FO screw.

**Conversion from Natural Gas to LPG**

IMPORTANT: The conversion must be performed by a qualified CORGI technician, ensuring that compliance is maintained with local regulations and the device is properly fitted. Disconnect the electricity supply and adjust the LPG injectors accordingly.

**Adjusting the Gas Rate**

Using a thin screwdriver, turn the screw located near the rating plate to modify the gas supply rate. This adjustment should align with the specifications provided in the accompanying table. After making the necessary changes, reassemble the unit in reverse order.

To access the thermostat by-pass screw for adjustments related to the conversion to LPG, proceed as follows: tightly screw the anti-thermostat by-pass screw to finalize the shift from natural gas to LPG. After adjustments are complete, ensure everything is properly reassembled at the front of the device for safe operation.
