### Care and Cleaning Instructions

**Pre-Cleaning Protocol:**  
Before disconnecting the appliance from the electricity supply, allow the cooling fan to cool the unit down.

**Cleaning Materials:**  
Avoid using bleach-based cleaners as they can damage finishes, including painted surfaces.

**External Cleaning of the Appliance:**  
Do not use abrasive pads (like Brillo) on painted or finished areas. Instead, use a soft cloth. Remove any excess cleaners immediately to prevent damage to the finish. 

**Control Knobs Warning:**  
Do not attempt to remove any control knobs, as this could cause damage and create a safety hazard. Follow the specific cleaning instructions for the knobs.

**Cleaning Ovens:**  
The Stayclean surfaces must be cleaned manually. Instead of abrasive cleaners, use recommended products specifically for Stayclean surfaces.

**Care for Stayclean Surfaces:**  
Food splashes can occur when the temperature is around 220°C. Maintain optimal performance by allowing the Stayclean surface to heat periodically for one hour; this will help reduce build-up. 

**Tips for Roasting:**  
To reduce splashing while roasting, brush meat rather than using excess liquids. Ensure even cooking by avoiding overcrowding and allowing adequate space for heat circulation to prevent over-browning.

**Cleaning Racks, Wireworks, and Oven Furniture:**  
These items can be washed in a dishwasher. Remove wirework runners by unhooking them from the top and gently pulling them out. 

**Replacing an Oven Light Bulb:**  
Use a 300°C screw type bulb. Always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply before replacing the bulb. Remove the cover with a screwdriver and replace the bulb by unscrewing it counterclockwise.
