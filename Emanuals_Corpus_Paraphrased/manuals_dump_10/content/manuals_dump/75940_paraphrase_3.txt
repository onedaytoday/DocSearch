To deactivate the function and the OFF switch, press and hold the ON/OFF button for a few seconds. A timer counts down from a specified duration until it automatically turns off. If temperatures rise higher than the preset limit of 5°C, warnings will activate both visually and audibly.

If there’s a temporary interruption or thawing occurs, a warning indicator will blink, especially if the temperatures exceed -4°C. The appliance will also alert you to technical malfunctions, displaying error codes (F1 to F7) that need to be resolved by a qualified service technician.

Additionally, maintain proper food storage by adjusting shelf heights appropriately and ensuring items are placed correctly to promote airflow. Store food such that heavy items are at the bottom, avoiding obstruction along the airflow paths for optimal cooling.

Regular maintenance is essential, including frost removal at least once a year or when frost accumulates significantly. Always follow safety guidelines during cleaning and maintenance, ensuring that the appliance is powered off before performing any tasks.

Lighting protocols should be followed during adjustments or cleaning. Familiarize yourself with the specific operating and safety standards applicable, including those outlined by relevant legislation and regulations to ensure optimal appliance performance and safety.
