### Troubleshooting Instructions

**Hose Inspection and Maintenance**  
First, check the hose for any clogs. If it is blocked, consider cleaning it with the appropriate options based on the selected procedure. Ensure proper hose distribution—too much or too little can impact performance. Adjust as necessary and check for any obstructions.

If the hose needs to be emptied or cleaned, ensure it is securely attached. When dealing with stubborn blockages, use suitable cleaning products. After addressing clogs, ensure that all components are correctly reassembled to restore functionality.

**Technical Specifications**  
To receive technical assistance, contact the service department. Important specifications include water supply requirements and consumption values. Review the EEC reference rating to ensure compliance.

**Installation Guidelines**  
For installation, ensure that the hose connections are correctly positioned and secured. Use the supplied spacers and instructions for proper assembly. Be mindful of potential obstructions around the hose placement, especially when dealing with extreme temperatures (below 0°C).

Should the hose become damaged, a replacement is necessary. Ensure the new hose complies with relevant regulations and is suited for the equipment being used.

**Water Stop Mechanism**  
The water stop feature prevents water flow in case of hose damage. Ensure that this mechanism is functional by checking the connections. Properly secure all fittings to avoid leaks.

**Electrical Connections**  
Follow the specified electrical requirements closely, and ensure that the system is properly grounded. Take care when replacing any components; failing to adhere to guidelines may lead to safety hazards.

**Environmental Considerations**  
Dispose of the unit and its components responsibly, following local recycling regulations. If you require more information on recycling, consult your local service center or the point of purchase.

For proper maintenance, follow the recommended washing procedures, typically allowing loads to be washed without pre-washing. Always refer to guidelines for optimal performance.
