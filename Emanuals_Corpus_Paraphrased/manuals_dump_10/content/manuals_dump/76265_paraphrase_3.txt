### Instructions for Using the Delay Timer

To set the Pre-Wash in conjunction with the Delay Timer, press the PRE-WASH button. The WASH TIME indicator will also light up, displaying the time set for pre-wash, which typically lasts about one hour. You can press the DELAY TIMER button repeatedly to adjust the hours as desired.

Ensure the door is properly closed by pressing the DOOR/LIGHT button. The status light will indicate if the door is securely shut. If the light flashes when START/PAUSE is pressed, it means the door is not closed correctly.
