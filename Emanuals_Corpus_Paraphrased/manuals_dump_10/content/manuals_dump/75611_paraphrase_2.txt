When initializing your ice maker, ensure it's turned on promptly. The ice maker may take several hours to start producing ice, with output measured in pounds per hour. If you hear clicking sounds, this is normal when switching it on or off, indicating the machine is functioning correctly. Be advised to check the water supply connection to avoid malfunctions.
