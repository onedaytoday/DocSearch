**Hose Installation and Usage Guidelines**

Ensure the hose is properly aligned with the threading during installation. The hose may require lengthening. If you purchase a hose, consider a specialized type with a water-stop feature to prevent damage. This section outlines necessary standards and regulations that must be adhered to, particularly regarding service authority requirements.

The hose should be internally plumbed at a depth of approximately [specific depth not provided], ensuring the top does not exceed a certain height. The internal service specifications dictate that if the hose is below designated limits, it should be connected accordingly. Any outlet should be connected correctly to maintain the efficacy of water supply.

Warning! This appliance must be grounded. Disconnect the electricity supply before proceeding with installation, following the specified ratings and information. Use components that conform to ASTA (BS1363/A) standards. Wiring should be color-coded: Earth connections must follow designated colors, and neutral (N) and live (L) wires must adhere to specific color codes. 

Caution is advised as improper connection can lead to electric shock. If any component requires replacement, contact Service Force. Ensure the switch and electricity supply meet regulatory standards.

Installation Preparation:

When preparing for assembly, refer to the originally specified assembly guide. Secure the components using appropriately sized screws, ensuring a snug fit. The mounting height should be adjusted according to the installation requirements and secured with the necessary screws.

If modifications are needed, ensure that all components are correctly oriented. The mounting must accommodate the necessary height adjustments, allowing sufficient clearance for installation. 

Additionally, ensure that your appliance is treated as a household item for recycling. It is advisable to follow local recycling guidelines to mitigate health hazards associated with improper disposal. For detailed information regarding recycling, consult your household service provider or the place of purchase.

Note: Normally, pre-washing before loading is not required. The appliance is designed to operate effectively with items that are clean, and it should be adequately maintained for optimal performance.
