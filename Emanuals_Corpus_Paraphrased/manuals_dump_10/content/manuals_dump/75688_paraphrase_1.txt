### Chillers Overview

**Chilling Process**
Chillers effectively cool cooked food from +90°C down to +3°C, which helps to minimize bacterial growth. The chillers streamline the cooling process, enabling food to reach +3°C quickly and efficiently, maintaining its safety and quality.

**Design and Operation**
Chillers are designed with robust features that ensure optimal performance. The operational modes include soft chilling at +2°C and standard chilling at +12°C. The ARTE system allows for continuous temperature control through a built-in or accessory-operated cooling mechanism, providing real-time data about the cooling process. A countdown timer and service alerts are displayed to assist in managing the chilling cycle, with each mode (P1, P2) easily selectable for different operational needs. Any deviations from normal functioning are recorded and monitored for HACCP compliance.

**Performance and Construction**
The performance of chillers is tailored to different food types, with advanced cooling systems designed to meet NF and UK regulations. Constructed from AISI-grade steel and featuring high-density polyurethane insulation that is HCFC-free, these chillers are engineered for durability and hygienic operation. Additionally, the design includes rounded corners and an IP20 protection rating.

**Technical Specifications**
Chiller specifications include productivity ratings aligned with NF guidelines, dimensions, and capacities for various configurations. Essential accessories, such as single and multi-sensor probes for chilling and freezing, are provided. Additional choices include wheel support for blast chillers, various rack systems, and printer connectivity for HACCP data documentation.

**Installation and Hygiene Certification**
Chillers require specific installation protocols, including plumbing for water collection. They are certified by the AFAQ AFNOR Certification authority according to NF031 hygiene standards, ensuring compliance with thermal performance and cleanliness requirements.

This comprehensive design and operational framework ensures optimal chilling performance and safety in food handling.
