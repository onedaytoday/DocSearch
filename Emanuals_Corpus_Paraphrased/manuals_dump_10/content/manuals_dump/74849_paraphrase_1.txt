**Important Safety Information for Electrical Connections**

This appliance is required to be earthed. Ensure that the electrical supply connections correspond with the specifications indicated on the rating plate, which can be found on the back cover of the unit. The supply should be integrated with ASTA (BS) standards. The wires must be connected as follows: the earth wire, which is yellow/green, should be linked to the terminal marked 'E' for earth; the neutral wire, typically blue, should connect to the terminal marked 'N'; and the live wire, often red, should attach to the terminal labeled 'L'. 

Please ensure proper insulation to avoid electric shock. The switch must be in the 'OFF' position when performing these checks. The unit should be wired according to its higher rating of type "Y" using H05RR-F standard cable. The green/yellow earth wire should have a larger cross-sectional area than the phase wires to ensure safety.

**Functional Checks**

1. **Earth Continuity:** 
   - Check that the appliance is properly earthed and connects to the electrical supply. The earth connections should be clean and secure.
  
2. **Insulation Check:** 
   - Disconnect the appliance and turn off the switches. If the reading shows a fault, ensure all connections are properly insulated. 

3. **Polarity Check:** 
   - Inspect the polarity of the supply connections. The live and neutral should correspond correctly to prevent electrical hazards.

**Commissioning Procedure**

To commission the appliance:
- Adjust the settings to maximum and minimum as instructed.
- If there are issues such as lights not functioning, follow the outlined troubleshooting steps.
- Use a thin screwdriver to adjust the screws as necessary to ensure proper functionality.

**Conversion to LPG**

For conversion to LPG, please ensure that the process adheres to the specified guidelines to maintain safety. Adjust the gas rate by turning the designated screw to achieve the desired performance settings.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

Always use appropriate cleaning products that comply with safety standards. Regular maintenance is crucial for optimal performance.
