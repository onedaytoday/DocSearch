**Completion/Removal Instructions:**

To complete or remove the selected cycle, ensure "RINSE HOLD" is chosen, at which point the "START/PAUSE" button will flash. You can either press the "START/PAUSE" button again—this will finalize the cycle—or turn the program selector to "PUMP OUT." If you want to conduct a "SPIN" or "SHORT SPIN," make sure to press "START/PAUSE" again. At the end of the cycle, the door lock indicator will light up. Turn the machine off once the process is complete.

If there is an issue with overloading, the cycle may not complete. Consult the instructions for specific cycle settings, such as "COTTONS/LINEN," "EASY-CARE," and "COTTONS/LINEN ENERGY SAVING." For easy-care fabrics, many options are available but refer to the provided guidelines on suitable programs.

**Cleaning and Maintenance Instructions:**

For cleaning, use household cleaners compatible with the machine's surfaces, making sure to avoid abrasive materials. Regularly clean the unit to prevent issues, especially the filter and casing. All components should be securely in place. Before cleaning, turn off the machine and unplug it. 

For troubleshooting, refer to the instructions if any issues arise during operation, such as the “DOOR” light flashing or if it’s stuck in a cycle. Ensure that the door and all connections are properly secured. If foaming occurs or if cleaning is required, follow the respective instructions, including any necessary adjustments to the water flow settings.

**Emptying Dangers and Precautions:**

Before emptying, switch off the machine and disconnect it. Avoid potential hazards by allowing the water to drain into a bucket when detaching the hose. The hose should be removed properly and any necessary seals checked. 

If a rinsing option such as “RINSE+” is required alongside cycles like “COTTONS/LINEN” or “DELICATES,” select the appropriate program settings while adhering to safety standards.

**Child Safety Instructions:**

Ensure the child lock is activated to prevent unintended use. If any issues with the lock arise, consult the instructions for proper activation methods.

**Installation and Connection Notes:**

Install the appliance with care, ensuring it is properly earthed. Inspect the connector and cable to meet safety regulations. If there are issues, you may need to address potential hazards caused by improper placement (e.g., near heat sources). 

For installation, the appliance must be level on its feet, allowing for adjustment as necessary. Follow guidelines to prevent breakdowns. 

**Electrical Warnings:**

This appliance must be earthed to prevent electrical shock. Ensure all wiring adheres to the specified color codes for connection. Any repairs should only be carried out by qualified technicians due to the risk of serious injury. 

Follow all EU directives and repair guidelines for compliance and safety.

### Water Supply and Drainage Instructions

**Water Supply:**  
To connect the appliance, ensure a proper water supply is plumbed in accordance with the authority's regulations. If connecting through a hose, follow these guidelines:

1. Unscrew the hose from the appliance.
2. Ensure that water flow is managed effectively through the faucet.
3. If a new inflow hose is necessary, use the hose supplied by AEG Service Force. 

When attaching the hose, ensure it is tightened securely by hand without excessive force. 

**Water Drainage:**  
The drainage hose must be correctly positioned and the supplied hose should be utilized. It's important that the hose remains unobstructed and elevated, with the top of the hose located higher than the water outlet to prevent backflow. 

For optimal performance, the pump-out height must be considered and measured from the outlet. Further information can be obtained from AEG Service Force.
