**FCR Motors and Gearmotors Technical Manual**

**Manufacturer:** Browning, Emerson, and affiliated Emerson Corps.  
**Application:** www.emerson-ept.com  
**Rights:** MCIM13005E 9055E  

**Safety Instructions:**  
Ensure adherence to operational safety protocols and proper lock-out/tag-out procedures to prevent accidents, including potential injury or death from exposed components. Regular inspections must be performed to ensure that the equipmentâ€™s installation aligns with the specifications on the nameplate and conforms to safety standards. 

**Installation Guidelines:**  
Maintain cleanliness and protect the equipment from mechanical shocks and voltage fluctuations. Ensure a clearance of three inches from the cover for ease of maintenance and grounding. When using normally closed thermostats, they must be wired correctly to maintain a proper holding supply, sourcing from 180V DC or directly from a 575V supply. 

**Caution:**  
Always disconnect the rectifier cell during testing for current insulation or dielectric strength. 

**Electrical Specifications:**  
The system operates on three-phase configurations with onboard rectifiers, allowing interchanging connections between SO6 and SO8. Supply voltage options include 190/380V and 575V. Ensure switches B1 and B2 are disconnected, per provided schematics.

**Mechanical Release Procedure:**  
Manually release the system by unscrewing the mechanical release mechanism. It is crucial to follow the disassembly instructions carefully, ensuring that housing assembly and screws are secured correctly upon reassembly. 

**Troubleshooting:**  
For abnormal heating or mechanical issues, diagnose potential causes promptly. Address phase short-circuits or mechanical lock-ups by checking the cleanliness of components and ensuring proper supply continuity. When switched off, the motor/gearmotor should rotate freely for assessment.

**Reference Information:**  
Refer to nameplates for specific gearmotor and FCR specifications, and consult troubleshooting sections for any operational issues.
