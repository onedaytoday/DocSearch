**Racks and Offset Placement:**

When using racks, food should be positioned to ensure proper airflow, avoiding direct contact with hot surfaces to prevent burns. Offsetting racks allows for optimal placement based on your dish type and height preferences, providing flexibility in managing cooking heights. This spacing is crucial for allowing heat to circulate evenly around cookware and ensuring that items like cakes do not stick.

**Handling Cookware:**

The type of cookware significantly affects heat distribution and cooking efficiency. It’s important to use materials that conduct heat well and are easy to clean. During cooking, heat should be evenly balanced, allowing food items to reach the desired temperature without burning.

**Cooking Techniques and Settings:**

Utilizing the convection setting helps ensure consistent heat is available for different cooking tasks. When preheating, select the desired temperature and initiate the preheat process. Be mindful that the preheating can be canceled at any time if needed.

**Preheating Options:**

To initiate preheating, select the upper oven, press the bake option, and set your desired temperature. The oven will display a preheating status, and once it reaches the set temperature, it will be ready for cooking. If adjustments to cooking times are needed, these can be made at any point during the preheating process.

**Cooking with Recommended Settings:**

Always adhere to the provided guidelines for preheating and cooking temperatures. If the cooking temperature exceeds the recommended levels, set it back appropriately and monitor to avoid any fire hazards. For meats, ensure proper preheating to facilitate effective roasting and to allow fat to drain effectively.

**Convection Cooking Considerations:**

Convection cooking offers enhanced heat distribution. It’s advisable to follow specific instructions for each dish to optimize cooking times and temperatures. Adjust cooking settings as necessary based on the nature of the food being prepared.

By maintaining these practices, you can ensure effective cooking while minimizing risks associated with overheating or improper handling of hot items.

### Overview of Perfect Convection Cooking 

Convection cooking utilizes heated air circulation, ensuring even cooking for meats and poultry. This method surrounds the food, reducing cooking time and promoting uniformly cooked results. The ideal temperature range for convection cooking, as per factory settings, is typically between 350°F (176°C) and 550°F (288°C). Preheating is essential for optimum performance, especially when cooking various food types. Utilize the chart below for guidance. 

To initiate convection cooking, press the UPPER OVEN button, followed by CONV ROAST, and then START. The display will indicate PRE-HEATING, which will turn off once the desired temperature is reached. You can cancel the cooking process at any time.

### Roasting Instructions 

When roasting, ensure that the grease tray is properly positioned to catch drippings and allow heat to circulate effectively. Proper seating of the roast without a cover will enhance browning. Do not exceed recommended cooking temperatures, and refer to the Convection Roasting Chart for specific guidance. 

### Internal Temperature Monitoring

Utilizing a probe to check the internal temperature is crucial for verifying doneness and ensuring food safety. For meats like poultry or pork, the minimum recommended internal temperatures are 170°F (76°C) for poultry and 210°F (98°C) for certain cuts of pork. Insert the probe into the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bones, to get an accurate reading. 

### Cooking with Various Options 

Be aware of the food safety risks associated with undercooking, which can promote bacterial growth. Use the KEEP WARM option if needed, and always preheat before beginning any cooking process. 

### Slow Cooking 

For slow cooking, ensure food is thawed when necessary and consider recommended temperatures to avoid burning. For proper results, use cooking settings appropriately, whether on high or low. 

### Defrosting Foods 

When using the Defrost setting, monitor the food closely to ensure even thawing. This method utilizes indirect heat, so avoid cooking foods at high temperatures during this process.

### Yeast-Leavened Products 

For bread proofing, allow dough to rise at specified temperatures with light cover. Use the BREAD PROOF function for best results. 

### Using Favorites and Multi-Stage Cooking 

To utilize favorite settings, press the MY FAVORITE button; this allows you to save and recall preferred cooking modes. The Multi-Stage option facilitates a sequence of cooking settings without manual intervention. 

### Sabbath and Holiday Settings 

The oven features a special setting for use during Sabbath or holidays, which disables alerts and allows for uninterrupted cooking. 

### Final Notes 

Ensure that temperatures remain within the recommended ranges during cooking. For any concerns, consult the user manual or manufacturer's guidelines for further assistance.

The following instructions detail the use of various cooking features on the appliance. To begin, press the BAKE button and select either UPPER or LOWER, then press both LO and HI simultaneously for a few seconds until a sound indicates successful registration. Release the buttons after this. For Sabbath mode, ensure you set the temperature to 550°F and press START to activate the cooking features as needed.

Important cooking notes include ensuring that children are kept away from the lower oven when it's hot to prevent burns. Do not line the oven drawer or cover the oven rack with foil, as this can interfere with heating and cooking performance. Food items should be appropriately spaced within the oven to allow for proper airflow and cooking.

When cooking, always be vigilant about potential fire hazards. If a fire occurs, use an appropriate fire extinguisher, and do not attempt to move the pan or dish. Be sure to monitor the cooking process closely, adjusting settings as necessary to maintain safe temperatures.

For different cooking temperatures, such as 350°F, 450°F, or low settings like 170°F or 190°F, use the designated buttons on the appliance. The display will indicate when pre-heating has completed. You can cancel any cooking session at any time using the CANCEL button.

For optimal food safety, keep cooked items heated to at least 170°F, and be cautious of any food poisoning risks by not leaving items unrefrigerated for extended periods.

When setting preferences, you can manage the user settings through the USER PREF button, which allows for adjustments such as clock settings and temperature offsets.

Cleaning procedures are specified for maintaining the appliance. For self-cleaning, remove racks prior to initiating the cycle, and do not use harsh cleaners that could damage surfaces. Always allow sufficient cooling time after self-cleaning before handling any parts.

For surface cleaning, use non-abrasive cloths and avoid substances that could scratch or damage the finish. Consult the cleaning instructions for specific recommendations on maintaining both painted and chrome surfaces.

Overall, following these guidelines will help ensure effective use and maintenance of your cooking appliance.
