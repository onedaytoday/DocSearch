**READ AND STORE THESE INSTRUCTIONS**

Congratulations on your new refrigerator! Please ensure you complete and return the included product registration card.

**SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**

**WARNING**: Ensure the refrigerator is properly grounded using a three-prong outlet to avoid electrical shock. This grounding must comply with National Electrical Code (NFPA) guidelines and local ordinances. Using a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is not recommended as it can hinder performance and void the warranty. Always discontinue power by turning off the switch or unplugging the cord if maintenance is needed.

**INSTALLATION**

Select a location that allows for proper ventilation and is near a grounded electrical outlet. Ensure there is adequate clearance for both operation and cooling. 

**LEVELING**

Verify that all corners of the refrigerator are level for optimal performance. Use the adjustable legs if necessary to achieve this balance.

**COOL DOWN PERIOD**

After installation, allow the refrigerator to cool for several hours before placing food inside to ensure optimal cooling.

**TEMPERATURE CONTROL**

The temperature control is factory set to provide satisfactory food preservation. Adjust as needed for your specific requirements.

**FEATURES AND LIGHTING**

Interior lights activate when the door opens. For maintenance, ensure the refrigerator is unplugged before changing the bulb.

**ADJUSTABLE SHELVES AND DOOR STORAGE**

The interior shelves can be adjusted to accommodate different types of food items, and door bins are designed for easy access to frequently used items.

**FOOD STORAGE AND ENERGY SAVING TIPS**

Store fresh foods at appropriate temperatures and avoid overcrowding to promote airflow.
