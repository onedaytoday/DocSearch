### III Operating Instructions

**General**  
Ensure the oven operates at a maximum temperature of 842°F (450°C). To ignite the pilot burner, turn the switch (VB and HB) counterclockwise. Hold the switch in this position for about five seconds until the light ignites. If the flame goes out, repeat the process.

**Igniting the Main Burner**  
Press the switch (VB, HB) lightly and turn it counterclockwise to the high setting. Adjust the temperature as needed by moving the selection switch from high to low.

**Temperature Selection**  
Adjust the temperature by turning the selection switch counterclockwise from high to low. The range spans from a maximum to a minimum temperature of 62.95°C.

**Initial Operation**  
The oven requires preheating before use. To turn off the main burner, rotate the switch (VB, HB) clockwise from the high setting to the off position, which stops the gas supply and extinguishes the flame.

**Pilot Burner Flame**  
To extinguish the pilot burner, turn the (VB, HB) switch clockwise from high to off. Ensure all burners are switched off during prolonged shutdowns.

**Cleaning**  
Allow the unit to cool completely before cleaning. Wipe down the cooking surfaces with a soft cloth suitable for food contact. For heavier stains, a commercial cleaner may be used, taking care to avoid high-pressure cleaners and harsh chemicals.

**Gas Burner Maintenance**  
Monitor the flame appearance. A yellow or improper flame may indicate a blockage or malfunction, requiring immediate attention. In cases of backfire or ignition issues, inspect the burner for cleanliness.

**Troubleshooting Malfunctions**  
If there are operational issues, consult customer service if the symptoms persist, such as the pilot not igniting or inconsistent gas flow.

**Storage and Shelf Management**  
Ensure proper clearance around the appliance for ventilation and safety. 

**Operating the Gas Oven**  
The roasting and baking oven is designed for uniform heating, equipped with thick materials for optimal heat distribution. Take care to avoid directly touching hot surfaces during operation.

### Instructions for Temperature Settings  
**For Roasting**: Ideal meat temperatures vary according to cut and type.  
**For Baking**: Preheat the oven adequately, ensuring food is arranged for even heating.

### Installation and User Safety  
Follow all applicable safety guidelines. The user is responsible for ensuring correct operation according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure the installation space adheres to regulations and that gas connections are secure and appropriate. 

This concise guide summarizes the technical operational instructions and maintenance tips for efficient and safe use of the gas-roasted oven, ensuring both performance and user safety.
