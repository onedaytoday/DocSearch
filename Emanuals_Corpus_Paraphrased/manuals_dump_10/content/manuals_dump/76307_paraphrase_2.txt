**Washing Instructions and Maintenance Guidelines**

The appliance can handle various fabric types, including white and colored sheets, tablecloths, standard household shirts, and synthetics. It is designed for items requiring normal washing at temperatures from 95°C down to 30°C, including specific care instructions for wool and delicate materials.

For washing, select appropriate cycles for synthetics, wool, or delicates, ensuring cold water temperatures when needed. Regular maintenance involves emptying the washing drum after use, especially with the night option turned on. The machine automatically reduces settings to prevent over-washing and creasing, ensuring that optimal wash conditions are maintained.

Before cleaning, disconnect the appliance from the power supply and consult the care instructions to avoid complications. Ensure regular upkeep of filters and hoses to prevent blockages; if issues arise, verify that hoses are correctly connected and not obstructed. If temperatures drop below 0°C, turn off the machine and drain hoses to avoid freezing.

If a malfunction occurs, refer to the error codes (E10, E20, E40) for troubleshooting. Ensure all connections are secure and that hoses are clear.

For installation, ensure that the appliance is earthed and correctly positioned, avoiding kinks in hoses or misalignment that could affect performance. Always consult an authorized service center for repairs and replacements.

When disposing of the appliance, follow local regulations regarding recycling and waste to ensure compliance with health and environmental standards.
