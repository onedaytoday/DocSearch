### IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
These instructions are critical for your safety and the proper functioning of the appliance. If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, please contact Customer Service. The appliance is heavy; care should be taken during installation. Make sure to adhere to the specifications, avoiding areas where it could be exposed to heat. When setting up, ensure that the back is unobstructed, following all installation instructions provided. It’s important to allow the appliance to settle for several hours before use, especially in environments with high humidity. 

Children should not be allowed to operate or play with the appliance to prevent suffocation hazards. Always consult authorized technicians for maintenance and servicing. Avoid placing the unit in direct sunlight or near heat sources such as stoves. 

To prevent frost-related issues, ensure food is positioned properly within the compartments. Be cautious of glass bottles, as they may burst due to freezing temperatures. For optimal performance, follow the manufacturer's guidelines closely.

### APPLIANCE DESCRIPTION
- Fresh Food Compartment

### OPERATION
The appliance has various operational features, indicated by lights and settings on the thermostat. Turning the thermostat activates the cooling function. If the red warning light is illuminated, it indicates internal temperatures are above acceptable levels. Ensure that the thermostat settings are adjusted appropriately depending on the food being stored to maintain freshness.

Use the fast-freeze function to freeze fresh items quickly, but avoid overloading the compartments, as it can obstruct airflow and affect cooling efficiency. Once food is fully frozen (usually after a few hours), you can return to normal settings.

### DEFROSTING
Frost buildup can affect cooling efficiency. When the frost layer becomes thick, switch off the appliance to defrost. Utilize layers of newspaper to absorb moisture during defrosting and turn the thermostat to the appropriate setting once completed.

### MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING
Always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply before cleaning. Use a soft cloth for cleaning; avoid harsh detergents, abrasive powders, or highly scented products as they may damage surfaces and leave residual odors. 

### TROUBLESHOOTING
For any operational issues, consult the troubleshooting section carefully. If the warning light blinks or if you encounter mechanical malfunctions, contact Service Force for assistance. Make sure to check the thermostat settings and room temperature parameters to ensure optimal functioning.
