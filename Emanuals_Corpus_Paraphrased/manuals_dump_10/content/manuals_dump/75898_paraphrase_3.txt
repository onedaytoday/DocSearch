### Operational Instructions

Please adhere to provided instructions for optimal appliance function. Ensure the appliance is grounded via a three-prong outlet to prevent electric shock. If troubleshooting is needed, contact a service technician. 

### Installation Guidelines

For installation, maintain clearances as specified. Avoid placing the appliance in areas exposed to extreme temperatures (below 55°F or above 110°F). Ensure the water supply is correctly connected, and wires are appropriately routed to prevent any entanglements. 

Adjust leveling legs to secure stability, ensuring the appliance is firmly positioned without rocking. After adjustments, retighten screws as needed.

### Control Features

Utilize the WaveoTouch™ control panel for various ice options (CUBES and CRUSHED). Ensure the display function is responsive and properly illuminates. The system has an automatic mode for energy-efficient operation during periods of inactivity.

To mute operation sounds or adjust settings, follow prompts on the display, including options for turning cooling off or accessing cleaning modes. 

By following these instructions, you can ensure safe and efficient appliance usage.

### Cooling System Operation Guide

To operate the cooling touch system, select your preferred options displayed on the screen. Press the designated buttons as prompted. After a few seconds of inactivity, if no action is taken, the system will automatically revert to a default state. The High Temp feature activates after a prolonged duration, accompanied by an alert sound, indicating a high temperature setting.

To deactivate, simply press the appropriate button until a confirmation sound is heard, and the display reads "HI," signaling the highest temperature reached. Other modes can be similarly acknowledged and turned off. Once deactivated, the system will operate normally. The Wave-Touch™ and IQ-Touch™ features are integrated into this cooling system for user convenience.

**NOTE:** While using Wave-Touch™, it is possible to switch the system on and off by pressing and holding specific buttons for a few seconds. Sounds may be muted by user preference, but important alerts will remain active.

The cooling system will automatically shut down after a certain period (up to three hours) to facilitate cleaning. The displayed temperature will revert to High Temp, and a notification sound will be emitted. 

Additionally, ensure the water supply remains functional to prevent malfunction. Press and hold the appropriate button for three seconds to toggle the Ice feature on or off. If the water supply is cut, it may cause audible alerts during operation.

To clean the interior of the unit, avoid using harsh chemicals. Instead, use a damp cloth. Allow any trays or components to dry completely before reattachment.

**CAUTION:** Shelves should be adjusted carefully, ensuring the fittings are secure to prevent improper closure. Proper airflow is critical for maintaining food freshness. For optimal performance, regularly check and clean components as necessary.

Finally, when using features such as the Perfect Temp™, engage by pressing the designated buttons, choosing from various options to maintain ideal food storage conditions. Ensure that the appliance is powered off during maintenance to prevent operation mishaps.

The abundance of fresh food can lead to overcrowded shelves, which diminishes cooling efficiency. Properly organizing meat and poultry sections reduces the risk of cross-contamination while ensuring airflow. For optimal performance, items should be stored tightly and in airtight packaging, as trapped food can spoil and cause odors. To maintain freshness, properly arrange newly purchased items with existing stock in the refrigerator.

High-efficiency cooling systems produce typical operational sounds. Sounds such as hissing from the defrost heater or clicking during the cooling cycle are normal and indicate the system is functioning correctly. Water sounds may be present during the operation. 

For the PureAdvantage™ system, ensure proper installation and maintenance to achieve optimal water performance and disinfection. When unpacking, follow instructions to activate and maintain the water system over time, ensuring it operates properly with adequate water pressure.

Cleaning practices should avoid harsh chemicals or scouring pads that could damage surfaces. Use a damp cloth to clean around controls and handles, and refrain from putting removable components in the dishwasher. To maintain the integrity of the appliance, follow all specified care instructions meticulously.

For LED lighting, ensure proper placement in the refrigerator to provide optimal illumination while preventing damage. If issues arise, reference troubleshooting guidance specific to lighting and cooling functions. Regularly check food storage for cleanliness and manage ice production efficiently to ensure a fresh supply.

**Continued Issues and Solutions:**

The refrigerator may be too cold or too warm, which can affect food storage. Please refer to the solutions above for better guidance. If the ambient temperature is hot or if food is stored in the common room, adjustments may be necessary. The automatic ice maker is functioning, but the refrigerator may have recently been disconnected. Note that too cold settings can lead to undesired conditions, so make sure the control for the fresh food section is set properly. 

Common issues can arise from dirty, worn, or improperly fitted parts, and this model features a high-efficiency, variable-speed compressor. The electronic control system detects temperature variations; therefore, allowing the refrigerator to stabilize could take hours after adjustments. 

To facilitate optimal ice maker operation, ensure no warm air is entering the refrigerator, and keep food and containers away from the door to avoid blocking it. For further troubleshooting, see the “Problems” section concerning door operation. 

**If Food Temperature is Too Warm:**
Moisture accumulation and frost can occur if the temperature control is set too warm, or if the water supply isn’t adequately connected. An obstruction in the water lines or high mineral content in the water may degrade taste and odor. Proper installation of water lines is essential; be sure to connect to the cold water line. 

To resolve moisture issues:
1. Set the temperature to a cooler setting and allow 24 hours for changes to take effect.
2. Ensure the water supply is properly connected, and run 10-12 glasses of water through the system to clear out contaminants.
3. Maintaining the humidity control (if available) at a lower setting can also help minimize moisture buildup. Regular cleaning is advised to prevent issues related to humidity and condensation.
