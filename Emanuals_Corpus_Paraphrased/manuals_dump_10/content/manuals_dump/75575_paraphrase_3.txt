The system features coolers designed for temperatures ranging from -10°C to -21°C, constructed with integrated components. This specific cooler model includes a pre-charged cooling assembly, utilizing advanced injection technology for optimal performance and high-efficiency polyurethane insulation. It is free of CFCs and HCFCs and incorporates rounded corners for improved safety. The fast-fit design facilitates installation and ensures airtight sealing using PVC. 

The units operate effectively under temperatures up to +43°C and are compatible with refrigerants such as R404A, with performance metrics varying based on high/low settings. Defrosting is handled via a heated mechanism to minimize downtime, accompanied by internal lighting rated at IP54. Each unit is equipped with an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting control, and a functioning thermostat. 

The right-hinged door is constructed with smooth, rounded edges to enhance airtightness and insulation, optimizing operating efficiency and compliance with HACCP standards. Additionally, various shelving accessories are available, including:
