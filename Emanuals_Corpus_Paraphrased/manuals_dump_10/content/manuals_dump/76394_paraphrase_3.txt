**Text Paraphrase:**

The options available may not have been selected correctly, which can affect the washing process. For traditional powders, add them directly to the drum; with traditional liquids, they should be used as indicated on the packaging. Compact powders and liquids should also be applied according to the marked areas on the container. Follow the specific instructions for functioning your washer. 

Fabric conditioners can enhance the washing experience by making ironing easier and reducing static cling. These are applicable for different machine types, so ensure you adhere to the instructions provided. Use MAX Bounce sheets for best conditioning results.

When washing, avoid exceeding the recommended load to ensure optimal cleaning, particularly for synthetic fabrics, as they can be susceptible to fire hazards if not handled correctly.

Regarding drying, choose the appropriate settings based on the fabric type. The drying chart outlines which cycle to use for various materials. For instance, towels might require an extra rinse to be cleaned thoroughly. 

Ensure to use the START/PAUSE function to control the washing stages effectively. The RINSE+, SPIN SPEED, and DRYING TIME buttons allow you to adjust settings as needed. The DELEGATE TIMER lets you schedule washing for later, with progress displayed once the START/PAUSE button is activated.

If there's an issue during operation, like excessive detergent, warnings will appear, and you should follow the guidance to address it. Always ensure that hose connections are properly positioned, especially before starting any draining or spinning cycles.

Cleaning the machine involves simple steps like checking for blockages in the hose and ensuring the outside and inside components are maintained. If any alarms or error codes like E10, E20, or E40 appear, refer to the troubleshooting section for resolutions. Ensure the machine is not overloaded and that connections are secure.

To maintain efficiency, keep the washers clean and inspect hoses frequently. Following these guidelines helps reduce issues and improves overall functioning.
