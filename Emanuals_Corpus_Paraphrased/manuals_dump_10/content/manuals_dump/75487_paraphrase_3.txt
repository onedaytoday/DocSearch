2. **Insulation Test:** Disconnect the appliance from the mains power and switch it on. Measure insulation resistance; the reading should be infinite. If it isnâ€™t, check the connections.

3. **Polarity Verification:** Inspect the polarity of the supply connections. Confirm the correctness of the wiring, particularly ensuring that 'L' (live) and 'N' (neutral) are correctly placed.

4. **Lighting Check:** Activate each switch manually to confirm functionality. It should indicate the state of the wiring and insulation.

5. **Commissioning Procedure:** To initiate, adjust the settings from maximum to minimum. If the light turns off, follow the outlined procedures.

6. **LPG Conversion Process:** For converting to LPG, turn off the electric supply and adjust the injectors as per the LPG specifications. Use a screwdriver to carefully secure adjustments.
