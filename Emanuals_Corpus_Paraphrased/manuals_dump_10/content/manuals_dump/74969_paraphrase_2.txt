For further assistance or concerns, consult your microwave's user manual or contact customer support.

### Important Information Regarding Microwave Cookware

When using your microwave for cooking and reheating, it is crucial to select appropriate cookware. Suitable materials include heat-resistant, microwave-safe options such as Corningware, microwave-safe plastics, pottery, and stoneware. It’s advisable to preheat these items before use.

**DO NOT USE** non-heat-resistant plastics or any cookware not designated as microwave-safe. To ensure proper microwave functionality, follow guidelines for food reheating, avoiding rapid high-temperature heating that can damage the food or the appliance.

### Microwave Overview

The microwave features a see-through window. Do not remove the turntable while the microwave is operating; it should always be securely in place. The light indicator will activate when the microwave operates. You can toggle the light by touching it once, allowing you to see the contents inside.

### Control Panel Instructions

To use the microwave effectively, familiarize yourself with the control panel. To set the clock, touch the TOUCH CLOCK button and specify the time (AM or PM). In case of an incorrect setting, you can clear it with the STOP/CLEAR button. 

### Cooking Procedures

- **Starting the Microwave**: Press the START button to initiate cooking. If you need to stop temporarily, use the STOP/CLEAR button.
- **Using Sensor and Auto Modes**: These modes tailor cooking automatically. Ensure that dishes are repositioned as needed to promote even heating. It's best to stir or rearrange food at least once during cooking or reheating to achieve uniform results.

### Manual Operation Guidelines

For manual cooking, simply select the required cooking time by pressing the appropriate buttons. You can use high settings for defrosting and cooking various food types. 

For defrosting, refer to the defrost chart for timing based on weight and type of food. Ensure food is covered to retain moisture and heat evenly.

### Using Sensor Modes

The microwave’s sensor modes are ideal for specific tasks like popping popcorn, reheating, and cooking fresh food. Monitor the food closely, especially near the end of cooking to prevent overcooking. 

If the appliance indicates an error or problem, you may need to pause and troubleshoot by consulting the cooking charts or attempting a manual setting.

### Special Instructions for Food Items

Properly wrap and cover food for even heating—leaving a small vent can help steam escape. Always check the internal temperature of meats and other dishes for safety, ideally ensuring they reach 160°F. 

Always follow the cooking charts provided for different food quantities and types to achieve the best results. 

Use these guidelines to operate your microwave effectively and to enhance cooking and reheating efficiency.
