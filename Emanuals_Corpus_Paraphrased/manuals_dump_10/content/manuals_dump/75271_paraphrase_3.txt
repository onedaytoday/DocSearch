This paraphrased text maintains the original meaning while presenting it in a more concise and organized manner for better understanding.

### Cook Duration
The Cook Duration feature enables the oven to automatically turn on and off. The time remaining is displayed, and the oven will shut off when the countdown reaches zero. This is compatible with various modes such as Convection, Defrost, Proof, and Perfect Cooking. To set the oven to cook at 450°F, select either the Upper or Lower Oven, press "Bake," then choose "Cook Options." Next, select "Cook Duration" and press "Start" to begin heating. You can cancel or modify the cooking process at any time. 

The End Time feature allows you to specify when the oven should shut off. Similar to Cook Duration, it will display the countdown and automatically turn off once the time is up. For instance, if you want to cook at 450°F until 6:00 PM, follow the same steps as above, but select "End Time" instead. 

### Broiling
Broiling uses high heat to cook food, particularly meats, quickly while achieving a browned exterior. The temperature can range from 300°F to 550°F. To broil, select the Upper or Lower Oven, press "Broil," and adjust cooking times accordingly. Remember to turn the food halfway through the process and use caution to avoid grease fires.

### Convection Baking
Convection Baking circulates hot air for even cooking. Preheat the oven and increase cook times slightly for best results. The temperature can range from 170°F to 550°F. Select "Convection Bake," then press "Start." Preheating alerts you when the oven reaches temperature. 

### Convection Convert
This function adjusts cooking times specifically for Convection settings. When using the Convection Convert feature, follow the instructions carefully to ensure optimal results. 

### Rapid Preheat
Rapid Preheat accelerates the heating process, ideal for quick cooking needs. Set the temperature between 170°F and 550°F using the Rapid Preheat feature. 

### Convection Roasting
This method is ideal for meats and poultry, ensuring even cooking while conserving moisture. Set the oven between 170°F to 550°F, and select "Convection Roast" to start. 

### Convection Broiling
For thicker cuts of meat and poultry, Convection Broiling provides an even, fast cooking experience. Utilize high heat between 300°F and 550°F and make sure to monitor the cooking closely.

### Warm Oven
The Warm Oven function keeps food at a safe temperature after cooking, typically between 150°F and 190°F. 

### Slow Cook
This feature allows for low and slow cooking, perfect for items like roasts or stews, to prevent burning. The temperature options include high (HI) and low (LO) settings, enabling hours of uninterrupted cooking. Always use a food thermometer to check doneness, especially for poultry. 

In all cases, consult specific cooking guidelines related to your food type to ensure safety and optimal results.

Sure, here’s a reformulated version of the text with the same meaning:

**DEHYDRATION**: This process involves using heat to remove moisture from foods like fruits and vegetables. The dehydrator operates within a temperature range of 100°F to 225°F, with an optimal setting around 120°F. Recommendations: Preheat the drying chamber and prepare the food accurately to facilitate efficient dehydration. To set the temperature to 120°F, choose either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN option, press the DEHYDRATE button, and then START. To cancel or stop the process, press CANCEL. For defrosting items such as cakes or pastries, select the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, hit the DEFROST button, and press START to initiate. Ensure food is properly thawed before cooking, following USDA guidelines for safety.

**BREAD PROOFING**: This method activates yeast in dough, typically set at a temperature range of 85°F to 100°F. To optimize proofing, preheat the oven and maintain proper airflow. To set the proofing temperature, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press the BREAD PROOF button, and then START. If adjustments are needed while the function is active, you can switch between UPPER and LOWER OVEN options, and then press START.

**TEMPERATURE PROBE**: This feature monitors the internal temperature of meats and poultry to ensure safe cooking. It operates effectively with convection cooking modes within a range of 130°F to 210°F, ideally targeting an internal temperature of 170°F. Note: Ensure completeness of defrosting before cooking. For accurate readings, insert the probe into the thickest part of the meat, avoiding bones. Select the UPPER or LOWER OVEN option, then choose COOK OPTIONS and PROBE, followed by START. The probe will notify you once the meat reaches the desired temperature.

**MULTI-STAGE COOKING**: This setting allows for sequential cooking methods, with up to three different stages such as convection and proofing. To initiate, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press MULTI STAGE, and choose your desired cooking method followed by START. You can cancel or adjust as needed while the function is active.

**USER PREFERENCES**: This section includes adjustable settings like clock display options, continuous bake, and temperature preferences (Fahrenheit or Celsius). To navigate preferences, press USER PREF and follow prompts. To set the time, press USER PREF, select CLO for clock settings, and follow instructions to adjust.

**MY FAVORITES**: This feature allows users to save and quickly access preferred cooking settings. To access or overwrite favorites, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press MY FAVORITE, and then START. To save a new favorite, follow the prompts provided.

**SABBATH FEATURE**: This function is intended for use during Jewish Sabbath holidays and will maintain the oven at a selectable temperature (default 350°F) without interruption. Once the Sabbath feature is activated, the oven remains continuously on without light alerts. To activate, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press BAKE, and set your duration before pressing START. Only the BAKE function is allowed while this mode is active. 

If any adjustments or specific instructions are required, ensure to follow the corresponding sections as outlined above.

### SABBATH FEATURE (CONTINUED)
To activate the Sabbath mode, press the UPPER OVEN and set it to BAKE at 425°F, followed by pressing START twice. Ensure that you only turn off the oven using the CANCEL button when needed. To deactivate the Sabbath mode, press both the HI and LO buttons for at least a few seconds. The oven will revert to its previous settings automatically after the Sabbath. Monitor the display for the appropriate indicators of this transition, as the food may require further adjustments.

### SELF-CLEAN FEATURE GUIDELINES
Before utilizing the self-clean feature, allow the oven to cool down. Always wear protective gloves when manually cleaning. Do not interrupt the self-cleaning process or use any cleaners that could damage the oven's finish. Heavy soiling and spills should be addressed promptly to minimize the need for extensive cleaning later. For routine maintenance, use a damp cloth and avoid any abrasive materials to prevent scratches. Regular cleanings will help maintain the oven's condition.

### STARTING THE SELF-CLEAN CYCLE
To initiate the self-clean cycle, ensure the oven is closed, and assign the desired cleaning duration (LIGHT, MEDIUM, or HEAVY) by pressing the corresponding buttons. After pressing START, the DOOR indicator will flash, and the cleaning cycle will commence. Allow approximately one hour for the process to complete. If you need to cancel the cycle, wait until the oven has cooled and the DOOR indicator is displayed.

### GENERAL CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS
To care for stainless steel, use the appropriate cleaning methods detailed in this guide to maintain its appearance. The oven door can be removed by following the hinge instructions located at the front. Ensure that any cleaning shield is in place during operation and that the oven is cool before any maintenance is performed.

### LIGHT AND BROILER PAN CLEANING
When cleaning the light or broiler pan, ensure no covering is present that can trap grease. Clean promptly after use to avoid buildup. Always preheat the oven for breads and cakes as required, and avoid overcrowding to ensure even cooking.

### TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
If the oven control beeps or displays error codes, press CANCEL to reset. For other issues such as excessive smoking while broiling or subpar baking results, adjust the oven settings and ensure proper maintenance has been performed. If problems persist, contact an authorized service provider for assistance.
