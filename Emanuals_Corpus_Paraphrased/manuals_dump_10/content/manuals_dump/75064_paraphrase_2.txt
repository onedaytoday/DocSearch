### Microwave Operation Guidelines for Defrosting and Cooking

The microwave’s operation mode automatically selects the appropriate settings for defrosting and cooking various foods. It’s essential to follow the recommended defrosting procedures for both raw and cooked items.

**Defrosting Instructions:**
- Ensure food is placed with the top facing upwards to capture heat effectively.

- When cooking meat, it is recommended to cover it to prevent drying out and ensure even heating.
- Follow the provided charts for specific heating times and methods depending on the food type.

**Maintenance and Cleaning:**

- Regularly check that the microwave’s interior and turntable are clean to maintain optimal performance.
