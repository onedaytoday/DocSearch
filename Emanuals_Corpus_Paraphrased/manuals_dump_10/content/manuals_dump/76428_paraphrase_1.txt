Here's a paraphrased version of the provided text, maintaining the original meaning in a clear and technical language:

Use cloth and grease as necessary when cleaning. For cold items, use bleach only on whites and fast-colored fabrics. Lightly treat stains on whites and colors with bleach, ensuring to follow up with a cloth. For lipstick stains, use a specialized treatment with bleach on whites. The first wash should involve applying bleach on whites and ensuring thorough cleaning. The choice of detergents and additives can impact cleaning efficiency, particularly at temperatures around 60°C. 

Always follow manufacturer instructions for washing, using the recommended amounts of products. This includes selecting the proper setting based on fabric types, such as synthetic or wool. Adjust the washing cycle as needed based on the fabric's care requirements.

To prewash synthetics or colored shirts, select the appropriate options and adjust settings from 90°C down to cold based on the fabric's resilience. Regular maintenance of the washing machine is crucial for optimal performance, including cleaning the lint filter and ensuring no obstructions exist in the drainage system.

In the event of a malfunction, power off the machine and consult the troubleshooting section immediately. If error codes such as E10 or E20 occur, follow the guidance to resolve these issues efficiently. Always ensure hoses are securely attached and clear of blockages to maintain proper functionality.

When plumbing, adhere to local regulations regarding hose lengths and connections. A correctly installed water supply hose is essential for service continuity and performance.
