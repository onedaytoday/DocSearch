**IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR INSTALLERS**  
All service must be carried out by an authorized technician. Please be aware that connecting electrical equipment, such as telephones and computers, to water lines for grounding purposes is a standard practice. This grounding may occur either within the building or externally and can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain. This feedback may cause electrolysis, resulting in a metallic taste or increased metal content in the water. To prevent this issue, it is crucial to utilize the appropriate materials as specified. Any drain fittings supplied by the installer should be made of plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the building's plumbing system.

**INSTALLATION GUIDELINES**  
Mount the fountain securely and connect it to the water supply as instructed. Do NOT solder tubes inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. Ensure the water supply is turned on and adjusted as necessary.  
Refer to the specific installation manual for the EDF210C (two-station fountain) and EDF310C (three-station fountain) for detailed rough-in dimensions and installation instructions.
