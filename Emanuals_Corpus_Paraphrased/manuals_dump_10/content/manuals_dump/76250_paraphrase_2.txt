To start the process, press the START/PAUSE button. If the DOOR indicator flashes when this button is pressed, it indicates that the door is not securely closed. When operational, the E40 warning will flash, followed by the MAIN WASH indicator. This sequence signifies that the door is properly closed and the START/PAUSE button can be engaged to initiate the cycle. If there is a need to track hours or adjust settings, pressing the START/PAUSE button will allow for corrections.

For specific wash options like QUICK WASH or STAIN, select your desired program and then press the START/PAUSE button to start the wash cycle. If RINSE HOLD is chosen, the START/PAUSE light will flash, indicating that the cycle has reached a pause state. To finish the cycle, one may turn the unit OFF and then switch to DRAIN or SPIN as needed.

Be cautious of overdosing on detergent as this can lead to incomplete wash cycles. The machine settings are versatile, allowing for cycles tailored to various fabric types, including COTTONS/LINEN and EASY-CARES, with temperature settings starting from 40°C to optimize stain removal.

When it comes to maintenance, ensure to clean the machine's filters and hoses regularly, as referenced. The process should begin with turning the unit off and carefully removing the cover for maintenance checks. If troubleshooting is necessary, consult the error code prompts, such as E10, E20, or E40, indicating operational issues.

In case of washing difficulties—such as inadequate rinsing or issues with water flow—validate that hoses are clean and functioning correctly. A significant focus should be placed on ensuring both the inlet and drainage hoses are correctly connected to prevent disruptions.

For any concerns regarding the functioning of your washing machine, consult the AEG Service Force for assistance, or refer to proper maintenance procedures outlined in the manual.
