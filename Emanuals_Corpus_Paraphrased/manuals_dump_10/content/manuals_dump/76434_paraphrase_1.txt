**DRYING INSTRUCTIONS**

**Warning!** Ensure correct drying settings for cotton and synthetic garments. Select the appropriate fabric type—cotton, synthetic, or wool—using the dryer settings. If items appear wrinkled post-drying, utilize the pressing function to reduce creases.

**WASHING AND DRYING CONTINUITY**: Maintain a non-stop washing and drying cycle. Observe the drying progress through three distinct phases indicated on the display. If necessary, turn off the dryer to stop any cycle at any time.

**SORTING AND PREPARATION**: Prioritize sorting laundry by color and fabric type—whites, colors, and synthetics should be washed separately. If washing new items, prewash them before mixing with any existing garments. Avoid overcrowding the washing drum to optimize cleaning.

**STAIN REMOVAL**: Address stubborn stains by treating them with appropriate solutions (e.g., soaking overnight, using specialized stain removers). For grease stains, utilize a cloth dampened with detergent. Additionally, follow fabric care instructions for items needing specific treatments.

**CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE**: Regularly clean the dryer and its components to prevent buildup. Disconnect power prior to any maintenance. Ensure the lint filter is clear and the water drainage system is functioning properly. Inspect the drain periodically to ensure it's not blocked.

**EMERGENCY DRAINING**: In case of an emergency, follow the steps outlined to manually drain the appliance. Allow the unit to cool, unscrew the drain hose, and redirect the flow accordingly. After emptying, reassemble all components securely.

**CAUTION**: Turning off the dryer during operation can result in fire hazards. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding operation and maintenance to maintain safety and efficiency.
