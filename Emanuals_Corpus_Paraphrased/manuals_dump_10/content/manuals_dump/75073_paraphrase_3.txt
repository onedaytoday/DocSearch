**Cooking Instructions on Convection and Defrosting**

When using the convection feature, the cooking performance is enhanced by high and low settings. It's advisable to refer to a cookbook or defrosting chart for specific food items. To initiate defrosting, press the “START” button after selecting the appropriate food from the Defrost Chart. Follow the guidelines for food amounts indicated and manually adjust if necessary. Once food is defrosted, ensure it remains microwave-safe.

For cooking, moisture is released from the food as it heats. Use a cloth or towel to cover the food to prevent splattering. Monitor the cooking process, pausing by pressing the “STOP/CLEAR” button if needed. To ensure food is properly cooked or reheated, check the appearance and temperature. If popcorn is prepared, stop the cooking process when popping slows.

For reheating soups or stews, cover the dishes appropriately to allow steam circulation and avoid spills. Follow the recommended methods for different food types, ensuring even cooking throughout.

**Broiling and Preheating Guidance**

For broiling meat and other foods, set the correct temperature and follow the given guidelines to achieve optimal heat distribution. Ensure that the food reaches the desired internal temperatures (e.g., 180°F for certain meats). If necessary, use covers to retain moisture.

When preheating for baking, it is crucial to let the cavity reach the specified temperature to ensure even cooking. Use the “START” button to begin preheating and carefully monitor the process.

**Mix Cooking Feature**

The mix cooking function combines microwave and conventional heating, facilitating the preparation of a variety of dishes, such as breads, which require browning. For optimal results, select appropriate temperature settings and follow the prompts on the display. After selecting the cooking time and temperature, press “START” to commence cooking.

Remember to adjust settings according to the specific food item and its cooking requirements, ensuring thorough heating and cooking consistency.
