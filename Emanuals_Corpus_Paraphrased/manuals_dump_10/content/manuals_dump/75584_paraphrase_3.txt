The system features coolers designed to operate between -2°C and +8°C, characterized by their substantial thickness and optional built-in components. This unit includes a pre-charged cooling assembly that requires installation expertise. It utilizes advanced injection technology to enhance thermal efficiency and employs pre-painted insulation, excluding CFC and HCFC. 

The design incorporates rounded internal corners and a fast-fit assembly, ensuring airtight connections with PVC components. Capable of handling high ambient temperatures (up to +43°C) and utilizing refrigerants such as R404A, the unit operates reliably under varying conditions. A defrosting system with heated components minimizes downtime, while internally mounted lighting (rated IP54) provides effective illumination.

Features include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat. The right-hinged door mechanism boasts smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges designed for airtight performance and high insulation efficiency, contributing to reduced operational costs while ensuring HACCP compliance.

Technical specifications include various voltage and phase options tailored for specific applications. Additionally, multiple accessory shelves are available, and options like a micro switch for the door, a graphic temperature recorder kit, advanced HACCP connection, and a thermal printer for monitoring comply with operational needs. Models such as CR20F084S, CR28F094S, CR16F094S, and HFBA080 are available, with no additional components required for CR20F100S.
