**Safety Information:**
To ensure safe operation, this cooker hood must comply with standards BS.6172, BS.5440, BS.6891, and BS.5482 (LP Gas Regulations). Observe the recommended height clearance to prevent overheating. If the appliance becomes hot, switch it off and allow it to cool down. Ensure the area is devoid of flammable materials during use.

**Child Safety Warning:**
Children should not operate the cooker hood unsupervised. To avoid overheating, ensure it is only used by adults.

**Operating Instructions:**
The four centrally located button switches control the lighting and motor speeds (V1 for low, V2 for medium, and V3 for high). Remember to clean the filters regularly, ideally once a month. The grease filter is dishwasher safe, and the charcoal filter needs replacement every few months or more frequently if heavily used.

**Maintenance:**
Replace the charcoal filter according to the guidelines provided. To clean the light fixtures, unscrew and replace bulbs as necessary. If lights malfunction, use a 40W clear E14 bulb.

**Troubleshooting:**
For issues where the appliance is not functioning, check if it is correctly connected to the power supply. Ensure the grease filter is clean and outlets are not blocked. If problems persist, contact Customer Service.

**Warranty Information:**
Electrolux offers a warranty covering defects for the first four months post-purchase. The warranty applies only if the product has been used according to the operating instructions and serviced by authorized personnel. 

**Installation Guidelines:**
Ensure the cooker hood is installed according to the following specifications:
- Canopy Height
- Chimney Heights (Upper and Lower Sections)
- Width and Depth of the Canopy
Compliance with I.E.E. regulations is mandatory for electrical connections.

**Clearance Considerations:**
Maintain the necessary clearance height as per technical specifications during installation, particularly for built-in applications. Follow guidelines for ducting or recirculation systems.

For detailed installation steps and technical dimensions, refer to the included diagrams and instructions provided in this manual. Ensure proper fixture and securing of all components during installation.

**Extraction and Ducting**

For optimal performance, the ducting should be as short and direct as possible. It should be installed tightly to avoid any reduction in efficiency. If the ducting route is longer or overly complicated, it may compromise the extraction effectiveness. The outlet must be positioned at the upper section of the unit, with the ducting correctly attached as per the supplied instructions. 

In situations where heating elements, such as burners, are in use, ensure that the ducting is properly sealed to prevent any air leaks. For units connected to heating systems, refer to the section titled "ELECTRICAL CONNECTION" for detailed guidance.

**Chimney Installation**

The chimney consists of an upper and lower section. The upper chimney should be adjusted slightly to facilitate the assembly, ensuring alignment with the outlet as shown in the diagrams. Secure this section with the provided four screws. 

For the lower chimney, make minor adjustments as illustrated to fit it properly, and secure it using the designated screws.
