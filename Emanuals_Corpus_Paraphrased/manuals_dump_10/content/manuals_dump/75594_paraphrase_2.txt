### Paraphrased Technical Text

To maintain optimal performance, the assembly is designed to continuously clear water from the trough, adjusting the thickness as necessary. This process is repeated until the mixture reaches the desired level. The system's operations prioritize cleanliness, and the resulting sounds indicate its status. You may notice a variation in cube thickness; this is influenced by both batch-specific and process-related factors.

**Cube Thickness Overview:** 

- Normal and desired thickness modes: 
  - Use the UP ARROW to increase thickness or the DOWN ARROW to decrease it. For adjustments, touch and release these buttons as necessary.
  - Avoid exceeding the thickness limits to maintain optimal operations.
  
**Operational Guidelines for Clear Ice Production:**

- Maintain ideal water temperatures—below 45°F (7°C) and avoid exceeding 110°F (43°C).
- Regular cleaning is essential for functionality; recommended methods include non-abrasive stainless steel cleaners. Do not use bleach-based products or abrasive pads, as they can damage the stainless steel surface.
- For deep cleaning, a monthly regimen using high-quality cleaner/polish is suggested.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

**Monthly Maintenance:** 
- Perform cleaning every three months to ensure efficiency. Handle all sharp components with care and use appropriate protective equipment.

**Monthly Deep Cleaning Procedure:** 
- Turn off the unit and clean the interior thoroughly. Disconnect the water supply and manage any obstructions in the line.

**Yearly Maintenance:** 
- Conduct a comprehensive system check and cleaning once a year, replacing any worn components immediately.

**Troubleshooting Guide:**

- If the unit appears to be malfunctioning, check normal operational parameters first.
