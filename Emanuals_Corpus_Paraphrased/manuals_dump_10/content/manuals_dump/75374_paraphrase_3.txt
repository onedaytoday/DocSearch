**Toasting the Cranked Oven**

**NOTE:** For details, refer to the Service Force Grilling Chart.

**Grilling Chart**
- **Food**: Rashers, Chops, Whole Trout/Mackerel, Plaice/Cod
- **Grill Time**: 2 crk. each for the items listed.

Position the shelves counting upwards from the bottom. The cranked settings adjust the top cooking element only.

**Top Oven Functions**

The top oven is designed for heating and cooking food, suitable for baking goods such as cakes. The top of the oven is recommended for certain foods while the baking surface should be adjusted to the lowest space.

**How to Use the Top Oven**
1. Set the Top Selector to "Top."
2. Activate the Top Heat.

**Important Considerations**
- The oven light indicates when it is ON and OFF, ensuring proper monitoring.
- Make sure the cooling system is in functioning order.
- To position the top oven shelf, place it straight back to ensure even cooking.

**Hints and Tips**
When roasting or preparing casseroles, it’s beneficial to use the top base directly. This setup minimizes cleaning and allows improved heat circulation. Ensure food sits at least an inch from the top heating element for even cooking. 

The optimal placement of cakes and Yorkshire puddings is centrally on the shelf. Utilize heavy or non-stick enamelware to enhance browning effect.

**Main Oven Functions**
