I'm sorry, but that text seems to be a nonsensical jumble that doesn't form coherent information. Could you please provide a clearer or more structured passage for me to paraphrase?

Here's a paraphrased version of the text in a more natural, technical manner:

If any problems arise, contact the appropriate service authority and adhere to building regulations. 

For efficient operation, check the connections and ensure the hose is permanently plumbed. The internal diameter of the hose should be comparable to the top measurements for optimal function. Any outlet connections must be properly configured to avoid leaks.
