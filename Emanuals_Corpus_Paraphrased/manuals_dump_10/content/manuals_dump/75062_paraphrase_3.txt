Sure! Hereâ€™s a technical paraphrase of your text, preserving the original meaning:

In the cooking process, automatic settings are utilized. The cooking time is initiated when the START/QUICK button is pressed. Adjustments can be made to the cooking duration by rotating the TIMER/WEIGHT dial either clockwise or counterclockwise. If the cooking requires a pause, the STOP button can be pressed. The display will indicate any adjustments made to the cooking timer. The START/QUICK button allows for direct cooking at high power for specified seconds, and you can monitor the countdown during the operation. This function is applicable for AUTO COOK or AUTO DEFROST settings.

For microwave operation, the PLUS and MINUS functions enable you to increase or decrease cooking times as needed. If food is cooked too firmly, use the MINUS function accordingly. To access the desired AUTO COOK mode, you should rotate the TIMER/WEIGHT dial and press the START/QUICK button to begin. Cooking results can be optimized to avoid burning food when using AUTO settings.

When grilling or browning food, make adjustments using the TIMER/WEIGHT dial, and initiate cooking with the START/QUICK button. The microwave's power can be set accordingly, whether using grill or dual grill modes. Your selections can influence the cooking duration and effectiveness.

For AUTO COOK and AUTO DEFROST, the microwave allows you to choose specific programs, which can be selected by pressing the appropriate button and adjusting the TIMER/WEIGHT as needed. Cooking progress is indicated by visual and audio cues.

For defrosting meat, fish, and poultry, initiate the operation through AUTO DEFROST, adjusting the TIMER/WEIGHT as necessary. For optimal results, rearrange food as it defrosts, ensuring even thawing without partially cooking.

For various recipes including gratins, thoroughly season and layer ingredients appropriately, covering the dish before microwaving. Grease components as necessary and correctly time your cooking for best results.

Always refer to the cooking charts for specific times and quantities for various foods, adjusting as necessary for the microwave's power and your food's characteristics. If cooking requirements differ, ensure to modify timings accordingly, particularly for high-fat foods.

When preparing dishes like soups and goulashes, cover appropriately during heating, ensuring even temperature distribution throughout the cooking process. For best results with meats and vegetables, it is essential to maintain coverage to retain moisture.
