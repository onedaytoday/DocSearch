Washers EIFLS60L SS and EIFLS60J IW IQ-Touch, available in various colors, include an optional Perfect Steam feature. The EIFLS60L SS model is a front-loading washer that has a high capacity and is ENERGY STAR certified. Its D.O.E. capacity contributes to energy efficiency. Key features include a Perfect Steam function, sound lighting, a water heater, and prewash and bleach options. The washer supports various cycles such as Normal, Delicates, Specialty Clean, and Active Wear, with the ability to use steam in certain selections.

The specifications indicate a height that varies based on installation type, either with or without cabinetry. A grounded three-prong power supply is necessary, compliant with National (NFPA) and local ordinances. Notably, the performance benchmarks are based on AHAM standards, indicating industry-leading efficiency. IQ-Touch washers include models like EIFLW55H (non-steam), EIFLS55I, and EIFLS60J. A 120V connection and specific amperage are required. 

For built-in or recessed installations, ensure proper clearances above and around the units. Product design allows for compatibility with different hose attachments (optional parts include PN EPWD15SS for white and PN STACKIT4X for stacking). Water hose installation must adhere to standards for hot and cold connections. Always refer to the included instructions for details on installation and operation. Manufacturers retain the right to modify product features without prior notice.
