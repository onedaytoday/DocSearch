If needed, adjust the component to align precisely with the top section. Ensure proper assembly by verifying that all parts are secured correctly. Tighten the Riving Item as specified below to ensure optimal performance. If necessary, rotate the component to secure it properly. Tighten the four head screws by turning them clockwise, as detailed in the instructions. For the M6 countersunk screws, insert them from the top through the plate, ensuring they are tightened accordingly.  

To install the switch correctly, fasten it with M8 head screws at the front, ensuring the switch buttons are oriented to the right. Connect the suction hose properly to the chipcase, referring to the "Operation" section for detailed instructions. 

Use three head screws with washers to secure the straightedge to the right-hand section, aligning it accurately with the teeth and ensuring a proper fit. Fasten with the M8 screws as instructed, ensuring the assembly is properly mounted. 

In terms of electrical safety, ensure all connections comply with the technical specifications, and verify that the equipment is properly earthed and tested. Use three-phase outlets as rated for protection against electric shock (RCD) as outlined in the specifications.

Be wary of any incorrect rotation; proper orientation during assembly is critical to prevent injury. Always operate the machine with the appropriate protective gear and follow standard safety protocols, particularly when dealing with cutting materials.

During operation, ensure that the equipment is securely mounted and that there is no risk of material entanglement. After adjustments, confirm the height settings are aligned and locked properly.

For maintenance, switch off the equipment before any servicing. Use proper tools to secure or adjust components, and ensure cleaning is done with appropriate materials to avoid damage. All repairs should be performed by qualified personnel.

When transporting, ensure to disassemble parts as necessary to facilitate safe moving. Adhere to all guidelines provided for optimal functionality and safety compliance.
