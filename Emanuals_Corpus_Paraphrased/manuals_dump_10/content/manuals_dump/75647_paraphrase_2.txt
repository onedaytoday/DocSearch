## IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
Ensure safe use of the appliance. Refer to the manual for proper handling and installation guidelines. Due to its weight and specifications, adhere to manufacturer recommendations or consult an authorized service provider. Avoid exposing the appliance to heat sources and follow the setup instructions carefully. Allow the appliance to settle for a few hours before turning it on. Ensure the refrigerator operates within specific temperature compatibility to prevent any fire hazards. Keep children away from the appliance to avoid suffocation risks. For maintenance or refrigeration tasks, only authorized technicians should handle any repairs. 

## DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLIANCE
Features include a bottle shelf and thermostat for temperature regulation. To operate, set the thermostat to the desired temperature, typically at mid-range. Several factors can affect food preservation, hence adjusting settings may be necessary. If defrosting is needed, check food storage practices to ensure they’re efficient. 

## HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES
Proper food storage is essential for safety. Monitor temperature settings to maintain food quality, keeping the refrigerator between 0°C to 7°C. Do not overfill or cover air vents and allow hot foods to cool before placing them inside. Keep food adequately wrapped to avoid cross-contamination.

## DEFROSTING
Locate the defrosting tray inside the appliance and ensure it remains unobstructed to prevent overflow. 

## MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING
Before cleaning, disconnect the power supply. Use only recommended cleaning products—do not use harsh detergents or abrasive materials. Regular maintenance includes clearing the drainage trough and ensuring that air vents are unobstructed.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
For issues, refer to the manual for potential causes and resolutions. Check if the light operates correctly and if the thermostat is appropriately set. If problems persist, consult customer support.
