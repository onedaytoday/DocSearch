**Defrosting Procedures and Best Practices**

When addressing frost-related issues, it's essential to follow proper defrosting practices. If frost builds up during operation, it can affect food preservation. Ensure that the frost is managed according to troubleshooting guidelines. If you hear any unusual sounds, verify the unit is operating correctly and not continuously running due to improper door closure or frequent opening. The "FROSTMATIC" feature may need to be activated or deactivated depending on current conditions, just as the "COOLMATIC" function should be adjusted as necessary.

Excessive frost accumulation can stem from the foods being too warm or from inadequate spacing between products. Ensure the unit door seals properly and that the food is not overcrowded. If water is leaking or pooling, check for blockages and clear as needed.

**Technical Installation Information**

For optimal operation, place the appliance in an environment free from heat sources like boilers and direct sunlight. Maintain adequate airflow around the unit, particularly at the back and top. Be cautious about the electrical setup; the appliance must be earthed to avoid electrical shock. Follow wiring color codes strictly for both safety and connectivity.

**Shelving Adjustments**

Rearranging shelves involves a specific process. Follow the arrows to remove or reposition shelves securely. Ensure proper leveling after adjustments. If you encounter any issues during installation or operation, consult the service guidelines or contact support.

**Environmental Considerations**

It is crucial to handle the appliance responsibly at the end of its life cycle. Dispose of or recycle as per local regulations to mitigate environmental impact. For more detailed recycling information, consult the purchase point or visit the manufacturer's website.
