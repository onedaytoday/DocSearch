The cooling systems consist of coolers designed to operate at temperatures ranging from -2 to +8°C, featuring variable thicknesses and either built-in or separate components. These three coolers are equipped with pre-charged cooling systems and are constructed using high-quality insulation materials. They are free from CFCs and HCFCs and feature rounded internal corners to enhance safety. 

The fast-fit design facilitates easy installation, and the systems include PVC components that ensure airtight sealing. They can operate effectively at ambient temperatures of up to +43°C and are compatible with refrigerants such as R404A. For defrosting, heated elements are integrated to minimize ice buildup and enhance efficiency. The coolers are equipped with controls including an ON/OFF switch, internal lighting control, and a thermostat. The doors are right-hinged with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring airtight closure and optimal insulation, which contributes to lower energy consumption.

The units comply with HACCP standards and come with various accessories such as aluminum shelves, poly tiers for cold rooms, door microswitches, graphic temperature recorder kits, and options for advanced connections in cold rooms. Additional items include plastic curtains for 65 cm door clearances and printers for HACCP compliance. You can reference the specific models mentioned, such as CR24N100R, CR20N117R, and CR28N117R for system compatibility and options.
