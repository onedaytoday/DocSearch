Meat and other perishable items should be covered with protective materials like plastic wrap or polythene to prevent contamination.

Be cautious with high thermostat settings, which may result in continuous cooling and strain on the appliance during extreme weather conditions.

Listen for normal operational sounds like whirring or clicking as the thermostat activates. Ensure that items are not blocking airflow to maintain proper cooling.

When installing or adjusting shelves, use the screws provided, ensuring everything fits securely. Familiarize yourself with the applianceâ€™s operation and maintenance instructions for safe handling.

Important safety information must be adhered to at all times. Avoid leaving perishable food in the unit for extended periods to prevent spoilage or freezer burn. If frost builds up, allow the appliance to defrost naturally, and do not use sharp instruments to scrape off ice.

For any servicing or repairs, contact authorized technicians rather than attempting to fix the appliance yourself, especially if you're inexperienced. Proper knowledge of the unit is essential for safe operation and maintenance.
