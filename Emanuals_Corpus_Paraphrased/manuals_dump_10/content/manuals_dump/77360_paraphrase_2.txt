### EMC Considerations

#### Conducted Noise
The conducted AC noise from power supplies encompasses both current-switching noise and other emissions. Compliance with standards like FCC or VDE is necessary. It is essential to optimize performance by adhering to the guidelines outlined in the Do's and Don'ts section (Section **X**). For conducted emissions assessments, refer to standards such as UL544 and EN60601. 

**Applications for VI-230-CV:**
1. Conducted input typical 
2. Circuit design involves C2 and C3 capacitor placements near the input and output to minimize common-mode noise.
3. The design must ensure low inductance by selecting appropriate components, which influences the coupling of both +IN and IN inputs.

**Noise Management:**
To enhance EMC performance, twisting input leads on the PCB is advisable. This reduces radiated noise and minimizes the impact of inductive coupling. The management of cross-sectional areas is crucial to contain conducted emissions.

#### Radiated Noise
Radiated noise is often generated by high-frequency switching (e.g., zero-current-switching) and is measured according to standards such as FCC, VDE, or MIL-STD-461. Properly routing and shielding the PCB can mitigate radiated emissions. 

**Switching Products:**
Switching noise typically appears as half-wave rectified waveforms, which can induce harmonics contributing to conducted and radiated emissions. The design should incorporate LC filtering strategies to dampen these effects.

#### Component Shielding
It is critical to ensure that the FET (Field Effect Transistor) is effectively shielded and grounded to the baseplate to minimize stray emissions. Insulators must be used appropriately to prevent unwanted coupling through rectifiers.

**Output Noise Measurement:**
To accurately measure output noise, attention to grounding configurations is essential. High-frequency components can adversely impact signal integrity if not handled properly.

#### General Recommendations
For efficient operation, ensure that all components have suitable ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) and ESL (Equivalent Series Inductance) characteristics. This will lead to better performance and compliance with EMC requirements. 

In summary, careful consideration of conducted and radiated noise through proper circuit layout, shielding, and component choice is essential in navigating EMC challenges effectively for the VI-200 and VI-J00 series DC-DC converters.

### EMC Considerations for RAM MI-RAM Operation

The RAM/MI-RAM LC design is focused on minimizing switching noise, which is typically high in these systems. Additionally, the active component of the RAM/MI-RAM is engineered to manage input harmonics effectively. Essentially, the active circuit inverts the input signal, leading to a significant reduction in unwanted noise.

Key components include the typical RAM setup (e.g., VI-230-CV) integrated with VI-RAM-C2, allowing for streamlined operations. It's important to note that the RAM/MI-RAM units can be directly mounted in chassis configurations.

When dealing with inductive loads, the RAM features should be handled carefully; shorting certain leads can compromise functionality, particularly impacting ripple performance. 

For applications utilizing the VI-200 and VI-J00 families of DC-DC converters, it's essential to follow the specified conditions to maintain optimal performance.
