**Wave-Touch™ Functionality Overview**

The Wave-Touch™ interface provides access to three display options: Water Cubes, Crushed Ice, and Touch Controls. The interface lights up brightly when active, and will turn off after a few seconds of inactivity. To manually turn the system ON or OFF, press and hold for three seconds. The LED indicator will illuminate when OFF.

Note that if the system is turned OFF, the water cubes and crushed ice functions are disabled. The OFF setting also activates additional food preservation features. Use the Touch Controls to activate or adjust settings.

You can access different options via the interface, which automatically activates or can be manually adjusted based on user preference. Each option emits distinct tones, which can be muted if needed, including when warnings are active. Resetting to factory settings is possible by a three-second press of the designated button.

When closing the unit, sound notifications will indicate completion. Importantly, if the high temperature is reached during operation, the system will maintain optimal performance.

The Wave-Touch™ interface is designed to comply with health standards, particularly during the Sabbath, where specific functions may be disabled automatically to ensure compliance.

To maintain optimal operation, particularly for the Perfect™ feature, ensure that the ice supply is connected and functioning properly. Following maintenance protocols is critical, as well as ensuring that water is supplied to avoid malfunction.

If there are issues with the water supply, regular checks should be made to ensure proper functionality. Additionally, cleaning agents should be appropriate for the device to avoid malfunctions.

**Shelf Features and Maintenance**

The shelving system includes smooth-gliding, ball-bearing, soft-close functionality. For cleaning or adjustments, shelves can be lifted straight upwards, ensuring not to force anything as it may cause damage.

In summary, it is essential to familiarize yourself with your Wave-Touch™ and IQ-Touch™ functionalities for proper operation and to maintain food quality and safety. Regular checks and maintenance will ensure longevity and efficiency.

### Perfect TM Overview

The Perfect TM is designed to hold food items at ideal temperatures, whether they need to be kept cool or warm, as well as in the fresh food section. It utilizes a smooth-glide ball-bearing mechanism for efficient operation. The thawing feature allows foods to defrost in a matter of hours. The system can be switched on/off, with temperature settings ranging from 28°F to 42°F. To toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius, press the associated buttons. Once a setting is selected, the corresponding temperature indicator will be activated. The Perfect TM can accommodate various food products, including meats, providing flexibility in temperature selection.

### Functionality

To ensure optimal performance, avoid cleaning the Perfect TM with abrasive cleaners. Instead, use a soft cloth for cleaning, and carefully remove the cover. The unit should remain off while the Wave-Touch TM or IQ-Touch TM functions are engaged. Regular maintenance is important for enhancing freshness by avoiding overcrowding, which can hinder cooling effectiveness.

### Fresh Food Management

Organize fresh food items to allow for proper air circulation. Avoid placing items too closely together, as this can lead to ineffective cooling. Ensure that meat and poultry are stored appropriately and securely, and utilize the Perfect TM for items that require specific care. When in use, the system will emit sounds indicative of normal operation, such as clicking or hissing, which are normal and signal that the system is functioning correctly.

### Water and Filters

For optimal water quality, the TM's water filter should be replaced every six months. This helps maintain performance and ensures purity. The activated filter ensures compliance with NSF/ANSI standards for water filtration.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

To maintain the aesthetic and performance of the Perfect TM, clean any surface spills immediately using soft, non-abrasive cloths. Avoid using cleaning products that may scratch the surfaces. If turning off the cooling function, make sure to address food items appropriately before short periods of non-operation.

### Ice Making 

The ice maker should be connected to a suitable household water supply and operated per the manufacturer's guidelines. If any issues arise, check for restrictions in water flow and address them accordingly. Regular cleaning and maintenance will ensure optimal ice production and quality.

In summary, regular upkeep and careful management of both food storage and system settings will enhance the longevity and functionality of the Perfect TM. For comprehensive information and troubleshooting tips, refer to the manufacturer's website or the documentation provided with the unit.
