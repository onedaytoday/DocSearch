**Microwave Operation**

Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation that heats food by causing friction between particles, resulting in heat that defrosts, warms, or cooks items. Microwave cooking offers reduced cooking times because microwaves penetrate food evenly, heating it from the inside out. This is particularly useful for reheating pre-cooked meals or defrosting food, although it can also be combined with conventional heating methods for optimal results. Cooking times are usually faster compared to traditional methods.

**Microwave Characteristics**

Microwaves interact with materials such as earthenware and plastic, which do not absorb microwaves, allowing only the food to heat while the dishes remain cool. Any covering used during defrosting or cooking can become too hot or may prevent even heating. Microwaves can cook food quickly, but care should be taken to monitor the process to avoid undercooking or overcooking.

**Cooking Modes**

- **Microwave Mode**: Standard heating from seconds to minutes, allowing quick defrosting and cooking. The power level can be adjusted according to needs.
- **Grill Mode**: Ideal for browning or crisping the top layer of food. Caution is needed to prevent burning.
- **Convection Mode**: Enables even cooking with pre-heating options, reaching temperatures up to 250°C without food, and promotes better texture across dishes.
- **Dual Cooking**: Combines microwave and convection or grill settings, effectively shortening cooking time.

**Auto Cooking and Manual Settings**

The microwave includes less and more buttons for precise adjustments while cooking. The Auto Cook feature simplifies cooking from frozen, and the START/QUICK functionality allows for immediate cooking in seconds. Various power levels and time settings are adjustable to meet different cooking requirements.

**Safety and Information Features**

Users can check settings while cooking is in progress, including power levels and pre-heating status. There are also recommended materials for use in the microwave that include specific types of cookware, ensuring safety and effectiveness during operation.

**Cooking Charts**

Detailed guides are provided for various baking and grilling functions, offering temperature and position recommendations for optimal cooking results.

Please follow the instructions carefully to ensure safe and effective use of the microwave. Always monitor food closely to prevent overcooking or burning, especially with new recipes or settings.
