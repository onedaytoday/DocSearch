**20GN1/1 Chilling System Overview**

This system efficiently chills cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly reducing bacterial growth within four hours. It then further lowers the temperature to -18°C. The equipment supports both chilling and freezing, allowing for extended storage periods of frozen food without quality degradation for several months. 

**Operating Modes**

The unit is equipped with multiple operating modes, including Soft Chilling (at +2°C) and standard chilling (at +20°C, +3°C, or -18°C). Each mode is activated via the control panel which continuously monitors conditions. It includes functionalities such as built-in UV lights (when used as an accessory), defrosting, and providing countdowns and service notifications related to operation (P1, P2). Data related to operation is monitored and recorded to ensure adherence to HACCP standards, especially when there are abnormal terminations.

**Chilling Performance**

The system is capable of chilling temperatures from +90°C to +3°C in less than four hours, complying with NF regulations.

**Construction Features**

The unit's exterior is constructed from AISI stainless steel with rounded corners and a high-quality polyurethane insulation that is HCFC-free. It meets ISO standards and features an IP20 protection rating.
