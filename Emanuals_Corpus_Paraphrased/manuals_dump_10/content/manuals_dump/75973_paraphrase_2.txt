### IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
Ensure adherence to these instructions for safe usage of the appliance. If you have queries about any of the warnings, please consult Customer Service. Given the appliance's weight, assistance is recommended during installation. Ensure compliance with specifications and utilize authorized service personnel when necessary. Avoid exposing the appliance to heat sources. Maintain proper spacing at the back as outlined in the instructions. After installation, allow the unit to stabilize for several hours.

Always supervise children around the appliance to prevent suffocation hazards. Only certified technicians should perform maintenance and repairs to ensure safety.

### APPLIANCE DESCRIPTION
This refrigerator model features adjustable shelves, fresh food compartments, and an adjustable thermostat. To operate, set the thermostat to the desired temperature while accounting for various factors affecting performance, such as ambient temperature and food types. The thermostat may need adjustment during unusually warm weather. Covering food with protective materials like plastic wraps or containers is recommended to maintain hygiene. 

### NORMAL SOUNDS
You may notice sounds during operation, such as whirring from the cooling system or clicks as the thermostat engages.

### HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES
Regularly check food quality; refrigerate leftovers promptly and ensure foods are stored at safe temperatures. Cooked foods should be allowed to cool briefly before refrigeration. Always keep raw meats sealed to prevent contamination. Maintain cleanliness in the refrigerator and remove any food spills to avoid buildup.

### DEFROSTING
Defrost the refrigerator as needed, particularly if ice builds up on the evaporator. Ensure the appliance is unplugged before cleaning the interior.

#### MAINTENANCE & CLEANING
Disconnect the refrigerator from the electricity supply prior to any cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning methods; avoid detergents, abrasive cleaners, and highly scented products that could damage surfaces. Clean the drip tray and ensure proper drainage flow.

### LIGHT REPLACEMENT
If the interior light malfunctions, disconnect the unit from power, unscrew the light cover, and replace it as necessary.

### TROUBLESHOOTING
If issues arise, such as insufficient cooling or unusual noises, check the following:
- Ensure the refrigerator is correctly plugged in and the circuit is functioning.
- Verify thermostat settings are optimal (10°C to 32°C).
- Check for blockages that might affect cooling.
