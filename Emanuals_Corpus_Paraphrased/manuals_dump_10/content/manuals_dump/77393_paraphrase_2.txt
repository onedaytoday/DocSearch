These guidelines ensure proper setup and operation of the equipment, including maintaining cleanliness during installation and ensuring all factory-supplied connections remain intact.

When charging the unit with R407C refrigerant, follow specific procedures to maintain safe levels and prevent excessive pressure in the system. Use proper interconnecting hoses for charging and always check the readings after installation, allowing the system to stabilize for several hours.

For charging operations involving the unit’s internal pressures, employ the charging function detailed in the iCOM documentation. The function regulates the system’s blower and compressor based on preset conditions. 

In all charging procedures, ensure that sight glasses reflect clear visibility indicating proper levels. The process should be carefully monitored, particularly in systems operating under low-pressure conditions. Any adjustments or maintenance must adhere to safety standards, particularly concerning insulation and exposure to atmospheric elements.

For water-cooled models, attention must be paid to the cleanliness of water supply and the isolation of the system to maintain optimal performance. The assembly retrofitting and adjustments also require precise torque specifications and operational checks after maintenance is performed. 

It is important to note that careful attention to the guidelines provided will enhance the reliability and efficiency of both air-cooled and water-cooled self-contained models.

**Paraphrased Text:**

To reduce the pressure and temperature thresholds, if the operational parameters fall below specified levels, adjustments will be necessary. Both thresholds can be modified, which affects the iCOM service from PSI to the respective limits. Factory-set offsets are established for these thresholds, which allow units to operate effectively once the parameters reach a defined operating range. Ideally, the location for installation should prioritize security and accessibility, situated on the ground or a stable support structure. Ensure that it is unobstructed from heavy supply routes while maintaining compliance with sound regulations to mitigate noise and vibration issues.

For Water-Cooled Self-Contained Models, the installation of the dry cooler should facilitate maintenance access. The site should allow for proper insulation to maintain efficient operation within specified temperature ranges. If applicable, provide protection against potential environmental hazards. Access for servicing—such as the disconnect switch—must be safe and adhere to NEC Class guidelines.

Proper water chemistry is crucial, including using additives that inhibit scaling and corrosion. This affects the overall performance, ensuring the treated water/coolant maintains efficacy and continuously protects against deposits. Recommended inhibitors should be tested and comply with industry standards. After cleaning or servicing, it is essential to charge the systems correctly to guarantee operational integrity.

Always read and follow product usage guidelines and safety Notices. Inhibit damage by managing chemical compositions appropriately, as poorly managed additives can decrease system efficiency. The dry cooler and related components, including pumps and hoses, must be maintained at their optimal conditions, addressing installation location and flow requirements. Utilize the provided tables for guidance on installation angles and connections for both field piping and factory piping, ensuring a successful operational setup. 

Product integrity is paramount; any mishandling can lead to operational hazards. In all aspects, maintain conformity with detailed manufacturer instructions and maintain communication with service experts to ensure proper functionality and safety standards are upheld.
