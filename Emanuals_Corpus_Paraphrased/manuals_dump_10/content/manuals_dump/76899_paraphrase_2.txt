To ensure a smooth and accurate installation, please review the following simple guidelines prior to starting. Confirm that your installation adheres to all applicable plumbing, electrical, and other relevant codes. When installing, be mindful that it's common practice to ground electrical devices, including telephones and computers, to water lines. This grounding may occur either within the building or externally. However, this can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, resulting in electrolysis, which can impart a metallic taste to the water or increase its metal content. To prevent this issue, itâ€™s essential to use the appropriate materials as specified. All drain fittings supplied by the installer should be plastic to ensure electrical isolation of the fountain from the building's plumbing system. 

Important: All service work must be conducted by an authorized technician. 

Please note the following installation details: Use a washer during installation to minimize the risk of damaging the fountain (note that mounting bolts and washers are not included). The back panel installation requires proper wall support for the fountain to be securely mounted. The preferred water supply connection is via unplated copper tubing, and a waste outlet connection should also be established as indicated. 

Ensure that the fountain is positioned according to the rough-in location, and connect the water supply thoroughly. Avoid soldering tubes inserted into the strainer to prevent damage to the O-rings. Follow all specifications, maintaining water supply pressure within the recommended limits to prevent warranty issues. 

Routine cleaning can be performed with a soft cloth or a gentle cleaner to maintain the finish of the fountain; avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials that could cause damage. For further technical assistance and parts inquiries, please contact your local distributor or Elkay Manufacturing Company.
