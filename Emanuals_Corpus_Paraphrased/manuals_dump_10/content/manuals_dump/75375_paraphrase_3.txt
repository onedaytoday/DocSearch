### Main Oven Usage Guidelines

**Main Fan Oven Preheating**
The main fan oven requires preheating to reach the optimal cooking temperature. It’s essential to preheat to the suggested temperature before cooking, as this ensures better results.

**Cooking Temperatures**
Always refer to the cooking chart and follow the recommended temperatures. In batch baking, a temperature reduction of 20°C to 25°C may be necessary.

**Using the Main Oven**
To operate the oven, ensure it is turned on. A light indicates when the oven is heating. If the cooling system is active, the light will also indicate this status.

**Adjusting Oven Shelves**
The oven shelves are adjustable and should be positioned in a straight line with the back of the oven. Correct placement is crucial for even cooking and browning. It is recommended to center the shelves to allow heat to circulate efficiently. When spacing, ensure that there is adequate room for air flow around the food.

**Oven and Cooking Recommendations**
Different materials, such as enamelware or heavy non-stick items, can impact browning. Avoid placing food directly on enamel surfaces, as this may cause excessive browning. If browning is too high, slightly reduce the oven temperature according to the provided cooking chart.

### Oven Cooking and Roasting Charts

**Cooking Chart**
Adjust cooking temperatures by up to 10°C where necessary. Below are recommended temperatures and shelf positions for various foods:

| Food                      | Shelf Position | Temp (°C)   |
|---------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Bread                     | Top            | 180          |
| Custard                   | Middle         | Follow Instructions |
| Eclairs/Profiteroles      | Middle         | 200          |
| Shortcrust Pastry         | Middle         | 200          |
| Roasting Meat             | Middle         | 160-180      |
| Chicken                   | Middle         | 180          |

**Roasting Chart**
Follow similar guidelines as the cooking chart to allow for appropriate cooking times and internal temperatures. Adjust by ±10°C if necessary.

### Defrost Feature

**Usage of the Defrost Feature**
The defrost function is designed for more delicate foods. This includes items like cheesecakes that may be sensitive to frosting. 

**How to Defrost**
Activate the defrost setting. Keep in mind that colder environments may prolong defrosting times. Smaller cuts of meat or thin items can take approximately 1-2 hours.

**Notes on Defrosting**
Once defrosted, cook the food immediately; do not refreeze. Adhere to safety guidelines to prevent bacterial growth.

### Care and Cleaning

**Basic Cleaning**
Before cleaning, ensure the oven has cooled down and unplug it. Avoid using harsh cleaners that may damage finishes.

**Cleaning the Outside**
Use non-abrasive cloths for outer surfaces and avoid cleaning products with bleach. Apply the cleaning solutions gently to prevent damage to the finish.

**Control Knobs and Handles**
Only use soft materials for cleaning to prevent dulling of surfaces.

**Inside the Oven and Grill Compartment**
Follow provided instructions for cleaning the interior surfaces with suitable cleaners.

**Stayclean Surfaces**
The Stayclean finish should be cleaned manually. If food becomes splattered, clean it off promptly to maintain the surface.

**Removing Wirework Runners**
To remove runners, unhook them from the cavity and pull them out carefully.

### Between Outer and Inner Glass Panels

To clean between the glass panels, follow these steps:
1. Use a screwdriver to remove screws at the top of the door.
2. Carefully take out the outer glass panel and clean it without damaging the finish.
3. Reinsert the outer glass securely once cleaned.

### General Maintenance and Troubleshooting

For issues not related to a clear operational failure, turn off the oven and allow it to cool before checking settings. Ensure the oven is receiving power and that all cooking instructions are followed.
