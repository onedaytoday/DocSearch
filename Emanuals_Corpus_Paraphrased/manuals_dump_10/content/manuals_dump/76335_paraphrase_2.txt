**Reference Document 9094-21/EN: Washer FOM CLS, FOM IEC**

**Introduction**  
This document discusses the installation and inspection requirements for the FOM CLS software, particularly in relation to laboratory reference standards. It addresses flow measurement and cleaning protocols for the system, emphasizing the significance of maintaining proper flow charts over a specified duration.

The FOM CLS framework adheres to international IEC standards. The integration of this reference is crucial for ensuring compliance and operational consistency, particularly in terms of the functionalities offered by the FOM CLS and FOM IEC systems.

**Software Changes**  
The latest version of the FOM CLS software introduces several enhancements, including:  
- **TEMP ADJUST functionalities** for fine-tuning temperature settings.
- **Speed Calibration options** for both low and high ranges to ensure precise operation.
- **Backlight adjustments** for better visibility during use.  
The system has undergone rigorous testing in accordance with IEC standards, and updates are available via service downloads.

**Inspection Procedures**  
During the FOM CLS inspections, the following aspects must be verified:  
- Clearances between components, ensuring adequate space for movement and functionality.
- The proper attachment of hoses to prevent leaks or blockages, confirming they are made from suitable materials (e.g., PVC) and connect securely to the system.
- Supply parameters must align with specified requirements to maintain efficient operation, particularly during heating cycles.

**Assembly and Calibration**  
Proper assembly of the CLS system is critical for optimal performance. Each component should be individually checked for installation accuracy. The system should also be manually calibrated as directed in the installation chapter. When calibrating, ensure the water level is adjusted to the desired specifications and confirmed via prompts.

**Operational Functions & Settings Adjustments**  
The settings menu allows for various adjustments, including:  
- Service program activations, with options to clear trip counters and adjust scale settings.
- Temperature control settings, with specific adjustments for water levels and operational timings.  
- User-defined options for interactive programming needs, including manual functions and operational pauses.

**Technical Adjustments**  
In case of weight function deviations, factory settings may need to be restored. Calibration instructions should be followed closely, particularly if flow levels are outside expected ranges. The FOM CLS can self-adjust based on operational readings, provided it’s configured correctly.

**Authorized Service & Settings Maintenance**  
Maintenance should only be performed by authorized technicians to avoid any misconfigurations. The system offers a range of functional default settings, allowing for operational flexibility and the adjustment of parameters related to water temperatures, flushing times, and operational cycles.

In summary, adherence to the aforementioned guidelines will ensure effective utilization and longevity of the FOM CLS system while conforming to recognized standards and improving overall performance.

I'm sorry, but the text provided is not clear enough for me to accurately paraphrase it while maintaining its technical meaning. If you can simplify or clarify specific sections, I'd be happy to help.

The FOM of the laboratory is connected to the FOM with the following operational instructions regarding the heating BSP. It is essential to operate the laboratory in accordance with these guidelines. If performance is compromised due to excessive temperatures, adjustments or replacements may be necessary. If the incoming flow or temperature is not optimal, measures should be taken to regulate them.

In terms of flow management, the FOM should maintain a straight section for the ELS's flow management. It’s important to account for the K-factor based on the specific installation, as this impacts supply performance.

If the settings are incorrect, adjustments are required to ensure the K-factor is accurate based on the flow measurements. Regular inspections are necessary to maintain optimal function.

Cleaning is crucial for maintaining the FOM's performance. Accumulation of lint and debris can hinder heat transfer and overall functionality. Steps should be taken to clean the heating element, housing, and associated components regularly to prevent build-ups.

Motor-operated mechanisms are designed for efficient emptying, utilizing self-clearing features with acme-threaded shafts. Proper operational conditions must be ensured to maintain functionality.

For reference, the system should be regularly cleaned, especially after certain periods or events. It is vital to follow the outlined instructions and schedule for routine maintenance, including the proper handling and disposal of cleaning agents.

Each month, regular checks for buildup and performance verification should be conducted following the guidelines provided. The results should be documented to ensure compliance and effective monitoring of the system.

The heating process must be closely monitored, and if temperatures exceed specified limits, appropriate action should be taken. Tables are provided for reference to aid in maintaining the specified operational parameters.

Additionally, the system should utilize the proper settings to avoid overheating and ensure that all components operate smoothly. Regular inspections and maintenance activities must not be overlooked for long-term efficiency.
