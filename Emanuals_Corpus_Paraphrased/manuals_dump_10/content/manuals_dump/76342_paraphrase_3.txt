**Paraphrased Technical Text:**

For effective cleaning, it's crucial to ensure all components are properly functioning and free from obstructions. If the temperature drops below freezing, take precautionary measures such as turning off the appliance, disconnecting it, and emptying any remaining water.

To troubleshoot issues such as unusual whistling sounds or improper water flow, first check if the appliance is correctly powered and the selector switch is set appropriately. Ensure that all hoses are securely connected and not kinked or blocked. If water is not flowing as expected, inspect the outlet hose for obstructions and follow the appropriate cleaning instructions to restore functionality.

Tighten any loose hoses or covers by turning them clockwise. Remove any blockages that may be affecting suction, particularly if you've selected the RINSE HOLD or SOAKING options. If the outlet hose height exceeds recommended levels, that could also hinder performance.

When handling or emptying the appliance, it’s essential to let it cool down first to avoid burns. Release the emptying hose carefully to catch residual water, ensuring that the appliance is fully emptied for it to function correctly. Follow all provided instructions to ensure the emptying hose is reconnected securely.
