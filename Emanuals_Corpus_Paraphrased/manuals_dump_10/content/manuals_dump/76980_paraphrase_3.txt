### DSP MAN-CAN402IG Homing Operation Notes:

If the homing process is interrupted, the system may revert to the last known position. Once homing is completed, it returns to the established set point. During the homing procedure, the reference sensor must remain active, otherwise, it will be deemed inactive, thus terminating the operation. Successful homing is confirmed by reaching the defined velocity parameters. 

### Offset Management:

The DSP MAN-CAN402IG allows for offset adjustments. Once the homing sequence is finalized, the offset is established relative to the home position. The offset parameter is defined as a 32-bit integer, which supports read/write operations via PDO.

### Homing Parameters:

The homing status is represented as an 8-bit integer, which is mandatory for operation. Velocity during this process is crucial and typically maximized when searching for a homing switch. The homing variables are organized in an array format, allowing for multiple inputs that trigger the homing sequence.

### Abort Conditions:

An abort condition will be triggered if the maximum limit is exceeded during homing. The homing status is stored as an unsigned 32-bit integer, which can be modified through read/write operations. The command reference provides comprehensive details regarding these settings. 

Homing is influenced by several parameters including the direction of actuation and the selected switches. The homing process may be independently managed to account for additional switches or inputs. In specific scenarios, the position count will increment until reaching the designated endpoint; otherwise, the system will revert if conditions are not met.

### Homing Switch Input:

In scenarios involving multiple homing switches, the system allows dynamic adjustments based on the configuration of these inputs. When the switches are activated, the system detects the chosen point automatically.

### Further Functionality:

The DSP provides closed-loop control for trajectory management with input influenced by PI/P settings. Exceeding specified thresholds can alter the operational velocity. Further details on timeouts and abort conditions are outlined, ensuring proper control of motion parameters.

### Input Parameters:

The DSP MAN-CAN402IG includes several input parameters, all of which can be adjusted and accessed via respective read/write entries. Notably, the system allows for adjustments in milliseconds to optimize response times.

### Profiled Position and Motion Types:

The software encompasses a range of motion profiles, including PTP (Point-to-Point) trajectories. Users can define motion characteristics including speed and polarity. The control system is flexible, allowing for immediate adjustments and a comprehensive motion profile management.

### Final Remarks:

Each parameter is reflected in system commands, ensuring seamless integration and operation. The software also includes mechanisms for adjusting offsets correctly, optimizing the overall functionality of the DSP.

## DSP MAN-CAN402IG Profile Velocity Overview

**Profile Velocity** refers to the typical speed associated with a motion profile. The **Profile Velocity** parameter, defined as `VAR type UNSIGNED32`, is optional and can be accessed as a read-write PDO entry. This parameter reflects the velocity determined by the SP command, which is further detailed in the Command Reference documentation.

In terms of its implementation, the profile velocity influences the speed at which the designated motion is accomplished. The parameter reflects the commanded speed once it has been reached.

The **Profile Type** is indicated as an `INTEGER16` and is mandatory for access through read/write PDO. It specifies the type of motion being executed. 

### Linear Motion Control

The motion plans are controlled to ensure the velocity typically decreases while approaching a designated target. A control word acknowledges the motion, enabling the system to manage transitions between different motion stages effectively. The interaction between control commands allows for immediate response when a specific condition is met.

### Interpolated Movement Information

**Interpolated Movement** can be synchronized with external inputs, facilitating coordinated motion. This feature is governed by the DS301 standards, which allows for motions to be processed with reference to past input readings rather than continuously sending new commands. The interpolation mechanism records inputs to optimize communication with the system.

When interpolated motion is inactive, all commands and records need to be updated until a valid state is reached. The system facilitates a control word flow to ensure trajectory consistency and acknowledges trajectory reception.

### Data Input Structures

The device configuration often interacts with various peripherals, requiring structured coordination. Data input types, such as arrays of `UNSIGNED8`, manage these inter-device interactions and allow for streamlined access across multiple records.

The system allows for a clear FIFO structure, managing how data inputs are processed — whether through First In-First Out logic or as contemporary data records. This structure influences how motion path data, particularly time-synchronized movement paths, is handled.

### Motion Synchronization

Synchronization mechanisms in **Interpolated Motion** ensure that commands are executed in a coordinated fashion based on the system's specifications. If a previous synchronization occurs, it can influence the timing of subsequent commands to enhance responsiveness.

### Profiled Velocity Configuration

The **Profiled Velocity** section outlines parameters for velocity input and threshold management, vital for ensuring timely responses when the motion is triggered. Key functionalities facilitate emergency stops as necessary, ensuring safe operation standards are upheld. 

Velocity increments are defined systematically, and adjustments are made based on specific factors that influence motion dynamics, ensuring seamless integration and operation within the system's framework. 

In conclusion, this detailed setup reflects a comprehensive approach to motion control, emphasizing the importance of clear, structured communication and functioning between data inputs, command processing, and execution of designated motion profiles.

**DSP MAN-CAN402IG - Velocity Parameters**  

The velocity, represented by `velocity_factor_1`, is an INTEGER32 type and is mandatory for entry with read-only access in the PDO. This velocity is an input variable that interacts with other velocities, denoted by UM=5 and UM=4.

Another velocity parameter is of type UNSIGNED16, which is optional and allows both read and write access in the PDO, indicating its status as either velocity or phase.

The velocity threshold, also measured in milliseconds, is classified as an UNSIGNED16 type with optional read/write PDO access. It determines whether the threshold is exceeded, indicating that the system is stationary.

Additionally, a profiled rated force is discussed. This section outlines the closed-loop force requirements, including conditions for switching the control word and trajectory adjustments for both rotating and linear motors. It emphasizes the importance of force information for operational simplicity.

Profiles are monitored through specific internal commands, which are impacted by the chosen operating profile. Details regarding these commands can be found in the Command Reference.

The velocity function is linked to the control word and includes a required rate measurement, expressed in thousands and categorized as INTEGER16 with read/write PDO access.

Reduced rates are calculated, and additional parameters such as the DC index and the rated force in Newtons are outlined with specified access rights.

Lastly, tables detailing physical units of measurement such as velocity and current ratios, as well as notation for factors, provide further clarification and reference.
