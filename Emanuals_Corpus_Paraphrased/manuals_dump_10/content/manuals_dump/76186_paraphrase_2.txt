**F30WC, F36WC, F42WC SERIES 4-WAY CONVERTIBLE RANGE HOOD**

**Important Instructions for Domestic Cooking Use Only**

**WARNING:** To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or personal injury, adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Installation Options:**
   - If using a non-ducted option, purchase the appropriate cover.
   - For ducted installations, please follow applicable guidelines.

2. **General Safety Precautions:**
   - Disconnect power before servicing or cleaning.
   - Ensure the service disconnect is locked and secure to avoid accidental turning on during maintenance.
   - Ensure the range hood is installed in accordance with local building codes, including those from NFPA and ASHRAE.

3. **Grease Fire Prevention:**
   - Cooking at high temperatures can increase fire risk. Avoid leaving the stovetop unattended, and clean grease buildup frequently.

4. **If a Grease Fire Occurs:**
   - Smother flames with a suitable cover or extinguisher.
   - Do not attempt to move a flaming pan; severe burns can occur.
   - Use a Class ABC fire extinguisher and know your exit routes.
   - In case of any difficulty controlling the fire, evacuate immediately and call emergency services.

5. **Ductwork Installation:**
   - For optimum performance, keep duct runs short and minimize bends.
   - Never vent the range hood into an attic space due to fire hazard.
   - Only use metal ductwork for installationsâ€”plastic is not acceptable. Ensure all connections are secure and sealed with tape.

6. **Range Hood Preparation:**
   - Unpack the unit and check for all necessary components, including mounting screws and the damper/duct connector.
   - Ensure the bottom of the hood is mounted above the cooking surface, aligning the top front edge with the cabinet frame.

7. **Electrical and Ductwork Planning:**
   - When installing, bring wiring through appropriate access points as specified. Secure all electrical connections and ensure proper grounding.

8. **Hood Usage and Maintenance:**
   - For blower operation, turn the switch clockwise to activate, and counterclockwise to turn off. Regular cleaning of filters is necessary to maintain efficiency.

9. **Parts List:**
   - Additional components such as screws, mounting brackets, and nameplates can be purchased locally as needed.

For detailed installation diagrams and additional instructions, refer to the corresponding figures outlined in the installation manual.
