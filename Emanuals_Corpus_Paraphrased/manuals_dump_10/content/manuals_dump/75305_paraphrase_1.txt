Here's a paraphrased version of the text in a technical manner:

The function has turned off, switching from AUTO to manual cooking mode. The system indicates this by emitting a sound and flashing the AUTO signal. To resume, press the flashing AUTO button; however, note that the functionality is limited during AUTO mode. 

For short-term roasting of meats such as minced or coated varieties (e.g., trout), or for dry items like mushrooms, preheat as necessary. Certain recipes like high cakes (yeast or short) require specific types of coatings and baking sheets. 

Recommended functions include preheating for top and hot-air heating methods. For frying and toasting, ensure proper temperature settings. 

Always consult technical guidance regarding cooking and roasting times, as overloading with inappropriate sizes can hinder appliance performance. Troubleshoot as needed based on users' needs.

For cleaning, ensure the appliance is turned off and cooled down. Use a damp cloth for regular cleaning but avoid aggressive scrubbing to maintain surfaces; only use dishwasher-safe components as necessary. Remove any excess grease regularly.

Make sure to follow electrical installation guidelines carefully, adhering to local regulations through professional oversight. Ensure that any built-in units maintain adequate ventilation. 

For type and safety, ensure connections comply with VDE standards to prevent overheating and ensure effective operation. The heating elements must conform to specific standards, with appropriate electrical ratings and installations.
