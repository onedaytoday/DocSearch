Based on the RABC framework, professionals recommend specific measures for drying and finishing various items, such as clothing and cleaning supplies, to minimize the risk of healthcare-associated infections. This necessitates careful handling of items, considering their potential health risks and the manner in which they are processed, regardless of whether they are contaminated or clean.

Processes should be adequately tailored to the existing workflows, leading to the development of operating procedures that meet the relevant specifications. The segregation of items is crucial, with recommendations including the use of color-coded bags: for instance, red bags for hazardous items and separate bags for linens, gowns, and catering supplies.

Trolleys play a significant role in the transport of these items. It is recommended to utilize lightweight, easy-to-clean trolleys that may be covered or uncovered, as required. These trolleys must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after use. Additionally, items should be washed using appropriate methods to mitigate the risk of infection, adhering to guidelines on temperature and washing cycles to ensure effective disinfection.

Upon finishing the washing process, items such as pillowcases and towels should be handled distinctly; for example, they're processed through the washer and sorted to avoid overloading, ensuring efficient heat application and moisture removal.

Lastly, measures must be in place to protect trolleys, either by using microporous covers or ensuring they are enclosed, to maintain their cleanliness during operations. It's imperative to adhere to established cleaning and disinfection protocols to ensure safety and efficacy in managing healthcare materials.
