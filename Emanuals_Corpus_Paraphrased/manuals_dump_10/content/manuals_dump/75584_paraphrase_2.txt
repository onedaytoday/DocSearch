The system is designed to operate in cooler environments (between -2 and +8°C) and features a construction that includes multiple thickness options and built-in components. This assembly is constructed using four sheets of pre-charged insulation for optimal performance and is made with materials that are free from CFCs and HCFCs. The internal corners are rounded for improved hygiene, and the fast-fit design enables easy installation. The airtight components, made from PVC, enhance efficiency.

The system is compatible with refrigerants R404A and operates effectively at ambient temperatures up to +43°C. It incorporates a heated defrost mechanism to minimize ice build-up and is equipped with internal lighting (rated IP54). Key features include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting control, and an operational thermostat. 

The right-hinged door has smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges that ensure an airtight seal and superior insulation, which contributes to lower operational costs and efficient functionality. Compliance with HACCP guidelines is ensured, and shelves and additional accessories are available.
