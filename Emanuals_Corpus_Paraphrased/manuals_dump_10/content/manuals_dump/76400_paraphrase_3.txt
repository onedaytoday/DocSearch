If you have white and colored cotton items, wash them at 95째C for cotton fabrics, 60째C for synthetic or colored shirts, and use the EASY IRON PLUS option for synthetics. When washing delicates, select the WOOL PLUS option at 30째C. If the STAIN option is chosen, ensure the temperature is 40째C or higher. The SUPER QUICK setting reduces the wash time.
