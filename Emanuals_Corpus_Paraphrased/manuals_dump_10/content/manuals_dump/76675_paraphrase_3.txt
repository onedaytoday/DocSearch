**Elite Screens Assembly Instructions**

To assemble the frame, begin by attaching the top and bottom tension elbows using the provided screws and plates. Ensure all screws are fully tightened for stability.

Next, align the corners carefully and secure each corner with the included screws. Follow the illustrated assembly guide to ensure correct placement.

For the AcousticPro1080 model, the black cloth helps mitigate light interference. Make sure to stretch the fabric tightly over the frame, ensuring that it creates friction against the backing for optimal tension. This enhances the acoustic properties by reducing external noise interference.

To attach the plates, ensure they are clean. Follow the step-by-step instructions for proper installation. Secure each plate to the frame with the recommended screws using a screwdriver.

**Installation Guidelines**: 
- Position the frame and mark locations for secure attachment. Ensure the wall anchors are robust enough to support the frame's weight.
- Take caution to avoid interference with any outlets or switches during installation.
- Use a soft cloth for cleaning, and keep away from sharp objects and harsh chemicals.
