**AG-61+62D-UK English Blanching Guidelines**

Blanching should be carried out effectively to prepare food. This involves heating items before covering them to prevent overcooking. Utilize microwaves for efficient blanching; these appliances are specifically designed for such tasks. Follow the provided instructions to determine the right amount of food to thaw, heat, or cook. For reference: for double the quantity, use nearly double the time; for half the quantity, use half the time. Take into account the cooking capacity when microwaving. Round items tend to cook better than those with corners, which may result in uneven cooking. Cover food during cooking to enhance efficiency.

When reheating or preparing food, ensure items are covered to prevent splatters and promote even heating. For defrosting, aim for a shorter time, and make sure to follow heat resistance guidelines when dealing with varying food thickness. Adjust times accordingly, particularly for denser foods, which require careful monitoring to ensure even heating.

**AG-61+62D-UK English Fresh Food Cooking Instructions**

For fresh ingredients, cooking should be done in their entirety, with typical seasoning applied as during conventional cooking. Familiarize yourself with specific cooking times to ensure proper doneness, especially for meats. Cooking methods in the microwave differ, and items such as onions can be cooked simultaneously without requiring turning. Generally, the fresher the food, the shorter the cooking time required.

**AG-61+62D-UK English Microwave Operation Guidelines**

Consult the operating manual for appropriate cooking modes based on food type—these encompass soup, meats, and baked goods. Standard operational steps include selecting the correct cooking mode, setting the timer, and pressing start. The microwave is designed to auto-count down once the start button is pressed.

**AG-61+62D-UK English Grill Cooking Instructions**

**AG-61+62D-UK English Multiple Cooking Functions**

For complex cooking processes involving various modes, each stage can be set using the timer. Use the START/QUICK function for direct cooking, which simplifies the operation time. To maintain safety during operation, engage the safety lock feature to prevent accidental use, and refer to the manual to cancel it.

**AG-61+62D-UK English Automatic Cooking Functions**
