**GRILL USAGE AND SAFETY**

**Caution for Young Children**: Children should be informed about the sounds produced by the grill as it heats up. The grill will automatically light within seconds when activated. The system will shut off if the lid is closed. Ensure the gas flow is stopped by closing the grill when not in use.

**Key Points**: The grill operates effectively when the top is closed. The cooling process ensures safety, and splatters can be minimized with appropriate coverings. Clean the grill surface with care to prevent fires.

**GRILL PAN AND HANDLE**: Ensure proper positioning of the grill pan and handle. The handle should be securely attached to prevent accidental disassembly. Position the grill pan centrally under the heating element.

**HINTS AND TIPS**: Adjust cooking times based on food thickness. Foods should be cooked thoroughly and lightly oiled, especially meats. Preheat the grill to a high setting before toasting or cooking. Monitor food and turn as necessary during cooking.

**GRILLING CHART**: Cooking times may vary based on food type and thickness.

**TOP OVEN USAGE**: The top oven is designed for even cooking of food. Position food on the appropriate shelf, ensuring the oven is preheated when cooking begins.

**USING THE TOP OVEN**: Turn on the oven and wait for the indicator light to signal readiness. Be mindful of safety precautions while operating.

**HINTS AND TIPS**: Ensure optimal cooking by placing food centrally on the shelf. Use appropriate trays to contain spills and minimize cleaning. Different materials will affect browning and heat distribution.

**MAIN OVEN HEAT ZONES**: The main oven has varying temperature zones, with the top being slightly warmer. Adjust food placement according to desired cooking needs.

**USING THE MAIN OVEN**: When operating, be attentive to the indicator light. Always preheat the oven before placing food inside.

**COOKING CHART**: Cooking times vary depending on menu items and shelf positioning. Refer to the roasting chart for specifics on internal temperatures.

**SLOW COOKING**: This method is ideal for tougher cuts of meat and is more economical. Slow cooking typically requires longer cook times but allows for more flavors to develop.

**FOOD PREPARATION FOR SLOW COOKING**: Meat should be thawed before cooking. Use a thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches at least 88°C. Soups and stews should be brought to a simmer before cooking.

**GENERAL SLOW COOKING TIPS**: Ensure food is adequately thawed and avoid overheating to prevent curdling. Cool and reheat food carefully when necessary.

**CARE AND CLEANING**: Always switch off and cool the appliance before cleaning. Avoid harsh chemicals that can damage finishes.

**CLEANING PROCEDURES**: Use appropriate, non-abrasive materials for cleaning the external surfaces. Clean control knobs and handles carefully to prevent dulling the finish.

**REPLACING COMPONENTS**: When replacing shelves and runners, ensure they are reinstalled securely in their designated positions.

**CLEANING THE HOB**: Maintain the hob by cleaning the top regularly. Ensure burners are properly seated after cleaning.

**CLEANING THE GRILL**: Regularly clean to prevent tarnishing and ensure proper functionality. Special care should be taken to clean areas around the burner.

**INNER COMPONENTS CLEANING**: Use manual methods for components with Stayclean coatings. Follow guidelines for cleaning products compatible with painted finishes.
