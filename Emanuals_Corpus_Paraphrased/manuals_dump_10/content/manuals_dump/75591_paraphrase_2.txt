The system includes cold storage solutions with temperature ranges of -2°C to +8°C, featuring varying thicknesses and options for built-in or remote cooling. These systems utilize pre-charged cooling technology and require assembly knowledge for installation. The new injection methods enhance performance and quality, using pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free from CFC and HCFC. 

The design includes rounded corners and fast-fit components for easy installation. These units are highly insulated and designed for airtight support with PVC materials. They can operate efficiently in ambient temperatures up to +43°C using refrigerants such as R404A. Defrosting is facilitated via a heated process to minimize buildup and ensure optimal performance, complemented by internal lighting rated at IP54.

Key features include an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a thermostat. The doors are right-hinged and equipped with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges for airtight closure and high insulation efficiency, ensuring reduced energy consumption. The system complies with HACCP standards and includes options for shelving as accessories.
