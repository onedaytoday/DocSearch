### Operating Instructions
This document contains essential information for safe and effective use. If the appliance becomes damaged, such as a cracked surface, immediately disconnect it from the power supply and contact AEG Service Force for repairs. Avoid operating the appliance while it is in a faulty state or if there are any obstructions. Keep children away from the appliance while it is in use and ensure it cools down before cleaning. 

### Safety Information
The cooker has four heat settings, with the highest setting allowing for rapid heating. Each cooking zone is equipped with a CHEC function, which ensures consistent heat distribution. More details on the CHEC feature are available in the user guide. 

The CHEC function can automatically adjust heat levels; it will deactivate when the temperature reaches 80Â°C. To select heat settings, turn the corresponding knobs. 

### Child Safety Feature
The appliance is equipped with child safety settings. To activate or deactivate the child lock, follow the instructions in the manual. 

### Cooking Guidelines
For optimal cooking results, begin with the highest heat setting to bring food items to temperature before reducing the heat as necessary. Ensure cookware matches the size of the heating zone for efficient energy use. 

When cleaning, avoid abrasive materials to prevent scratching, and handle the hob gently to maintain its appearance. Use a damp cloth to clean surfaces and ensure they are appropriately cooled down before doing so.

### General Maintenance and Cleaning
The splashguard should be regularly maintained to prevent contamination and fire hazards. Clean it appropriately as outlined in the manual, ensuring it remains unobstructed during operation. 

In case of any visible damage, report it immediately as such defects are covered under warranty. 

### Installation Instructions
Please ensure the appliance is installed correctly per the outlined specifications. Failure to do so can void your warranty and may lead to electric faults. Connect the unit to a suitable power supply, ensuring it matches the specifications (240V, 6400W) provided in the manual.

### Troubleshooting
If you experience issues such as circuit overloads or insufficient heat, verify the installation and connections. Contact AEG Service Force for further assistance if problems persist.
