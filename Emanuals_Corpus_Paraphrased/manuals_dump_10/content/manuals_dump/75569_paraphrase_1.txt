### The Bridge Overview

The Bridge is positioned at the front and is designed for use with cookware. It is essential to operate the Bridge appropriately when using cooking methods. Both the Bridge and cookware work together to generate heat. To use the Bridge effectively, you need to rotate it counterclockwise to heat the cookware or clockwise to cool it down. Make sure the cookware is properly placed on the Bridge to achieve optimal heat distribution.

Once cooking is finished, turn the Bridge off. The indicator light will illuminate when the Bridge is activated and will turn off after it has cooled down. It is recommended to allow food to cool when the Bridge is turned off. Always handle the cookware with care, as it can become very hot.

### Cookware Selection

Choose cookware based on its properties:

- **Aluminum**: Cooks food quickly but can scratch easily.
- **Copper**: Heats efficiently.
- **Stainless Steel**: Easy to clean and distributes heat well.
- **Cast Iron**: Heats evenly, but retains heat for a long time.
- **Porcelain-Enamel Metal**: Has a smooth coating but can scratch.
- **Glass**: Not recommended due to potential scratching.

Ensure proper circulation of heat around the cookware, which will help in even cooking.

### Oven Rack Arrangement

When operating the oven, always arrange the racks while the oven is cool. This should be done before cooking. Follow recommended positions for broiling, baking, and roasting various types of food.

### Warmer Instructions

To use the Warmer effectively, arrange food items upright to allow for even heating. It is advisable to cover food items for optimal warming and cleanliness. Use potholders to avoid burns when removing items from the Warmer.

Choose the appropriate setting (HI, MED, LO) for the type of food being warmed. If you need to adjust the temperature, do not touch the Warmer more than necessary to avoid confusion with the settings.

### Preheating Guidelines

Preheat the oven or cooking surfaces according to specific needs, especially when baking or roasting. Avoid overcrowding, as this can lead to uneven heating. Allow time for preheating and monitor food closely to prevent overcooking or burning.

### Cleaning Recommendations

Clean the appliance after use while it is still warm to ensure easy removal of spills and debris. Regular cleaning will minimize the need for extensive clean-up later. Use appropriate cleaning methods and materials to avoid damaging surfaces.

For self-cleaning, follow specific guidelines to ensure safe operation. Avoid using harsh chemicals that could scratch or chemically damage any components.

Always ensure that the appliance is completely turned off and cooled before beginning any cleaning procedure. Be cautious with cleaners, as some can cause permanent damage to the appliance's finish.

### Self-Cleaning Oven Instructions

#### Cleaning Process
The self-cleaning function utilizes high temperatures to effectively clean the oven by incinerating residues, reducing them to ash that can be wiped away with a damp cloth. Make sure to let the oven cool before beginning any manual cleaning. Always wear protective gloves when handling the oven during and after the cleaning cycle. **Important:** Do not forcibly clean the oven's interior, as this can damage the surfaces or components.

#### Caution Regarding Usage
Avoid placing items that canâ€™t withstand high temperatures inside the oven during the self-cleaning cycle, as they may warp or degrade. After the cleaning cycle, allow the oven to cool down completely before handling the interior or using a damp cloth to wipe out the residue.

#### During the Self-Cleaning Cycle
When the self-cleaning feature is activated, the oven heats up beyond typical cooking temperatures. It is normal for sounds and visual cues (such as the appearance of smoke) to occur during this process. If excessive buildup is encountered, it may require repeated cleaning cycles. 

#### Cleaning Precautions
- Ensure that any wall surfaces, racks, or oven accessories that are not designed for self-cleaning do not obstruct or become damaged during this process.
- Never attempt to override the locking mechanism during the cleaning cycle, as it is intended for safety.
  
#### Maintenance of Oven Light
The oven light will activate when the oven door is closed. Ensure that the protective glass shield is in place when operating the oven to prevent potential hazards.

#### Warmer Drawer Instructions
To avoid damaging the warmer drawer, turn it off before cleaning. Use a soft cloth and appropriate cleaner if necessary, and avoid abrasive materials that could scratch surfaces.

#### Warranty Information
This warranty covers defects in workmanship and materials for one year from the date of purchase. It excludes damage from improper use, unauthorized service, or other external factors. Claims must be made through authorized service centers. 

#### Limitation of Liability
The warranty limits claims for incidental or consequential damages, aligning with applicable laws. This warranty provides specific legal rights and may not cover additional rights that differ by region.
