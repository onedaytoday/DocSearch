### Speed Cooking Instructions

To prevent burns when cooking with high heat—especially at preheated temperatures of 450°F—ensure the cavity does not become too thick with food. For optimal results, touch the "Start" button once the food reaches the designated cooking point. Note that food can be cooked without preheating, using either high or typical cooking methods at 300°F. Begin with the "Touch Start" command, ensuring proper temperature is reached.

When baking cakes and similar items, preheat to a temperature of 325°F. For convection cooking, which allows for even heat distribution, initiate the process at 350°F. Touch "Convection" and then "Start" to preheat; an audible alert will confirm once the temperature is reached. If adjustments are necessary, you can modify the settings to reduce cooking temperatures by 25°F.

For microwave cooking, set the appropriate power level according to the guidelines provided, using the "Power Level Pad." This step helps in managing cooking times for various food types, including meats, poultry, and casseroles, as illustrated in the basic cook chart.

### Basic Cooking Chart

For meats, refer to thickness and cooking time based on whether they are bone-in or boneless. Follow the allowed limits indicated in the chart. If issues arise like arcing, check the placement of the food in relation to metallic components or containers.

- **Casseroles**: Use an 8-inch rack or container.
- **Pies and Desserts**: High settings at specified temperatures (cake at 350°F, pies at 375°F).

### Recipe Selection

Consult the Electrolux High-Speed Convection Microwave Oven Cookbook for recipe options. To select the desired dish, follow the food category chart, touch the corresponding button, and start the cooking process as specified.

### Microwave Options

Options available include Popcorn, Reheat, and Defrost. For popcorn, select the type based on the amount indicated in the Popcorn Chart and touch "Start." For reheating different foods like soups, use the corresponding charts while adhering to maximum amount guidelines to achieve the best results. If faced with restrictions on types or amounts, manual adjustments are required.

By following these procedures and charts, you will ensure effective cooking results across various food types using the Electrolux high-speed convection microwave oven.

### Reheat Chart

**Food Amount Procedure:** 

For reheating previously cooled foods, you may use wrapping or cover the food item. Use a paper towel on a plate for items like muffins or other baked goods. For soups, cover the container with a lid or wrap. 

### Cook Chart

**Food Amount Procedure:** 

To cook items like beans and peas, follow the recommended guidelines for heating. Wrap the food appropriately and ensure it remains covered throughout the process to retain moisture and heat evenly. A single plate is suggested to avoid overcrowding.

### Defrost Chart

**Food Amount Procedure:**

When defrosting prolifically meat products, like poultry and ground meat, rearrange pieces to ensure even thawing. Use a shield to prevent overcooking during the defrosting stage. 

**Note:** If the food exceeds the recommended amount, an error message may display. 

### Manual Defrost

If the food does not align with the specifications on the defrost chart, manual adjustments can be made. Monitor the microwave’s performance to ensure the food is thawed safely.

### Demonstration Mode

To activate, start by pressing the clock and then "START." The display will show "DEMO ON." Follow the prompts until it shows "END." To exit or reset, unplug the unit.

### Automatic Cooking Time Adjustment

This feature allows the microwave to adjust cooking times based on the load and factors such as moisture. If more time is necessary, adjust accordingly before initiating the cooking process by repeatedly pressing the relevant key.

### Child Lock

This safety feature can be activated by pressing the appropriate sequence to prevent unintended usage. 

### Cleaning and Maintenance

**Exterior:** 

Clean the microwave’s surface with a damp cloth and non-abrasive cleaner. Avoid letting cleaners come into contact with stainless steel trim directly.
