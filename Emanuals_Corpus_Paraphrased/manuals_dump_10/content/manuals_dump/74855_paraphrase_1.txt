### Main Fan Oven Usage

#### Overview of Fan Oven Functions
The fan oven circulates heated air around the back, uniformly distributing heat for efficient cooking. 

#### Preheating
Typically, preheating the oven is necessary to reach the desired cooking temperature. Cooking directly without preheating may not achieve optimal results, especially with frozen or prepared meals.

#### Cooking Temperatures
Always adhere to the recommended cooking temperatures found on the chart, adjusting by approximately 20-25°C for batch baking.

#### Batch Baking
When batch cooking, ensure proper selection of the fan oven settings. 

#### Shelf Arrangement
Install oven shelves straight and directed towards the back to maximize cooking efficiency. If placed incorrectly, cooking results can be adversely affected.

#### Cooking Tips
- Ensure that shelves are positioned centrally to allow optimal heat flow. 
- For batch baking, adjust spacing between shelves for even cooking. 
- Avoid placing food directly on high-heat surfaces to prevent excessive browning; use suggested cooking guidelines to adjust temperatures.

### Oven Cooking Chart
Use provided temperature and cooking time guidelines for various foods, adjusting by 10°C if necessary.

#### Roasting Times
Follow recommended roasting and internal temperature charts to ensure proper cooking.

### Defrosting Feature
The defrost function is ideal for delicate items like cakes or frozen meats. Activate it by turning on the selected setting until the desired temperature is achieved.

#### Important Considerations
- Foods should be thawed thoroughly before being cooked.
- Never refreeze or leave defrosted items at room temperature to minimize bacterial growth.

### Care and Cleaning

#### General Maintenance
Always disconnect the power supply before cleaning. Use appropriate cleaning materials and avoid bleach, which can damage surfaces.

#### Cleaning the Ceramic Hob
Use recommended cleaning products and techniques to remove burnt residues and maintain its condition. For stubborn stains, allow cleaner to act before wiping.

#### Preventing Hob Damage
Quickly remove sugar solutions to prevent surface damage, and avoid using abrasive cleaners.

#### Cleaning the Exterior
Avoid harsh chemicals and do not remove control knobs, as this may damage the appliance.

#### Interior Cleaning
Utilize Stayclean surfaces, which require minimal maintenance between 220°C cycles to maintain optimal performance. 

#### Glass Door Maintenance
Use household cleaners for the glass but do not remove decorative finishes. Ensure glasses are cool before attempting to clean.
