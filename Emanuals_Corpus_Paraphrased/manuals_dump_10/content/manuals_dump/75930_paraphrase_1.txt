The positioning of the rear section impacts the closure efficiency. This section is specifically designed to accommodate various food items including confectionery, ready-cooked meals, yogurt, bottled products, and seafood. The chiller unit indicates the freshness of meat and seafood, which is essential for maintaining food quality. The provided chart contains critical information regarding the recommended cooling temperatures for these food items.

The FROSTMATIC function is activated by pressing button (H), with button (G) indicating its status. Users can adjust the desired temperature using buttons (I) or (K), which will either illuminate or flash accordingly. The system will revert to the actual temperature if there is no input within a certain timeframe. The display will show the desired temperature as well as the current temperature.

To initiate the cooling process, press button (A) which will activate the light (M) indicating that the cooling phase has begun. Additional buttons can be pressed to adjust settings accordingly. It is advisable to allow food to cool adequately before inserting it into the chiller.

The FROSTMATIC function serves to preserve the freshness of already-stored food by rapidly freezing new items, helping to minimize temperature variations. If the FROSTMATIC function is activated manually, it will operate for a designated time period, after which it can be turned off. A warning indicator will flash if the FROSTMATIC state is engaged while an alert tone sounds.

When switching off the appliance, either the (A) button or the main power source can be used. For cleaning, it’s crucial to ensure all internal surfaces are maintained properly, avoiding harsh chemicals that could damage the appliance.

Regarding defrosting, it is recommended that the unit be kept clean to enhance overall performance. Proper arrangement of food items can improve airflow and maintain optimal temperatures. Objects should not be packed too tightly to prevent frost buildup, and hygiene should be strictly adhered to, utilizing approved cleaning products as necessary.

The manufacturer has provided essential guidelines to ensure safe operation and maintenance. Users should follow these instructions to prevent damage to the appliance and to avoid electrical hazards. If issues arise, users are encouraged to consult the troubleshooting chart for more detailed information regarding potential problems and sounds associated with normal operation.
