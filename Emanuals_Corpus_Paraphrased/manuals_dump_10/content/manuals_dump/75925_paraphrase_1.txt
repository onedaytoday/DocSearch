### RANGE COMPOSITION

The equipment features a range of assisted units designed for optimal performance and efficiency. Constructed with AISI stainless steel, the units come with functional construction features, including adjustable base, top, and back heights for easy access and maintenance of the interior. The internal design is completely rounded, enhancing sanitation and simplifying cleaning processes. 

Incorporating forced air cooling at temperatures up to +43Â°C ensures consistent internal temperature and effective preservation. The units utilize high-density expanded polyurethane insulation with cyclopentane injection technology for long-lasting thermal efficiency. They are designed to comply with GN specifications, such as the ZANUSSI REFRIGERATORS/FREEZERS LT, featuring self-closing doors and recessed handles for user-friendly operation. Additionally, the integrated microswitch automatically powers off the unit when the door is opened.
