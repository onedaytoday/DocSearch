**Instruction A-12.2R Active Overview**

When integrating products such as First and/or VCR into a theater system, it's essential to ensure that the audio synchronizes with the visual actionâ€”specifically, that sounds emanate from their corresponding locations. This precision allows viewers to perceive sounds moving from right to left in coordination with on-screen events. The amplifiers in home theaters enhance this sound experience, creating a sophisticated surround sound effect. The right front speaker is crucial for distinguishing between direct and surround sounds. Additional bass enhancements, including effects like explosions and crashes, contribute to an immersive experience.

For optimal performance, it is recommended to invest in active surround sound systems that enhance bass output. The UK Active A-12.2R is a prime example; it features an active subwoofer that should be connected appropriately. When connecting, ensure the subwoofer is positioned correctly and wired to the right outputs for effective sound delivery.

Key functions of this setup include managing sound phase and ensuring it aligns, as inconsistencies can disrupt the listening experience. The placement of the active subwoofer should also be optimized, avoiding corners to reduce potential bass distortion. Additionally, the built-in amplifier in the A-12.2R model is designed to support high-quality sound reproduction, emphasizing low frequencies.

**Safety Notice:** To minimize the risk of electric shock or damage, avoid covering the unit and refrain from servicing it unless necessary. Pay attention to specific operating and servicing instructions.
