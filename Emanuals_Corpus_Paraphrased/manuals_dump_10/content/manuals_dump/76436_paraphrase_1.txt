At the conclusion of the cycle, three lights will illuminate and an acoustic signal may sound, indicating the program has finished. To turn off the machine, ensure that you follow the instructions provided.

**Drying Guidelines**

- **Drying Settings**: Use only for cotton and synthetic fabrics. It is recommended to use drying cycles for textiles made from these materials and to ensure the hose is properly connected.

For non-stop washing and drying, select the appropriate options using the buttons. For optimal results, avoid overloading the machine and adjust the load according to recommended weights. 

**Sorting Laundry**

Sort laundry into categories: whites, colors, and synthetics before washing. Wash new colored items separately to prevent dye transfer. 

**Stain Removal Tips**

Use appropriate methods for treating stains. For instance, grease stains may require a cotton cloth and specific cleaners, and different stains should be treated according to their type.
