### MCC4060-UK ENGLISH Microwave Cooking Overview

Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic waves that heat food by inducing friction. This friction generates heat, effectively defrosting, warming, or cooking the food. The unique aspect of microwave cooking is that it heats food evenly from all angles, allowing for reduced cooking times. Microwaves can be used for heating prepared meals or defrosting food, and can also be combined with other cooking methods such as convection or grilling for optimal results.

### Characteristics of Microwaves

Microwaves can penetrate materials like ceramic and plastic but do not pass through metal, which is why only the food within those containers absorbs the microwave energy and is heated. This property enables efficient microwave cookery, but it's important to cover food during defrosting to prevent uneven heating or overcooking. While microwaves cook food quickly, combining them with convection or heating elements can result in more uniform and thorough cooking.

### Cooking Modes

1. **Microwave Mode**:
   - The default setting allows for quick heating and defrosting.
   - Cooking time can be adjusted in seconds and is intended for various forms of food preparation.

2. **Grill Mode**:
   - Best for browning and searing. Monitor closely to prevent burning.
   - Use only when food is present to avoid overheating in the cavity.

3. **Convection Mode**:
   - Suitable for baking and roasting. Preheat as necessary.
   - The turntable should rotate during preheating to ensure even cooking.

4. **Dual Cooking**:
   - Combines microwave and convection cooking for faster results.
   - Adjust temperature settings according to food type.

#### Additional Functions

- **Auto Cook**: Offers predefined settings for different types of food to simplify cooking from frozen or fresh.
- **Start/Quick Function**: Quickly starts the microwave for a specified duration without further adjustments.
- **Power Level Adjustment**: Easily increases or decreases power settings for precise cooking.

### Safety and Usage Notes

1. Always check settings like power level while the microwave is in operation.
2. Ensure food is appropriately covered during both microwave and convection cooking to avoid splatter and ensure even heating.
3. Avoid overheating the cavity by not operating the microwave without food, especially in grilling or convection modes.

### Recommended Cooking Practices

- Utilize the cooking charts for specific recipes or items, noting the required preheating and time settings for various foods.
- Be aware that cooking times may vary depending on the size, type, and starting temperature of the food.

This overview summarizes microwave cooking principles for efficient and effective use of the appliance, ensuring safety and optimal results in meal preparation.
