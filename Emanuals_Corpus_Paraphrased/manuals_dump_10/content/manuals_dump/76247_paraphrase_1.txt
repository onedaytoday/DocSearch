**Sorting Instructions for Laundry**

When sorting laundry, follow these guidelines:

3. **Bleach Usage**: Use bleach cautiously, only on whites and colored fabrics labeled as bleach-safe. Treat lipstick stains with bleach followed by thorough rinsing.

Positioning is critical when applying the covering, especially for coal-burning setups where the temperature falls below 0°C. Ensure that the hose is easily replaced to avoid malfunctions. When connecting the water hose, ensure it is securely attached, ideally connecting it to a supply line that’s not impeded. For optimal functionality, you may need to lengthen the hose; if this is the case, ensure any new hoses comply with local regulatory requirements.

It’s important that the hose is positioned correctly. Maintain the proper thread orientation and take care to ensure the hose is adequately supported and insulated. It should be positioned above the ground to facilitate ventilation and to avoid freeze-related issues. You should also adhere to specifications provided in the technical documents regarding installation and maintenance.

In the event of supply issues, use appropriate methods for repair and disposal, treating the hose like any household waste, and following guidance on recycling where necessary. For further assistance, you can refer to service information or the rating plate associated with the equipment. Always prioritize safety and compliance when performing installations or repairs.
