**Important Notice for Installers:**
Grounding electrical equipment, such as telephones and computers, to water lines is standard practice. This grounding can occur either within the building or outside of it. However, such grounding may lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, which can trigger electrolysis, resulting in a metallic taste or an increase in metal concentration in the water. This issue can be prevented by utilizing the appropriate materials as specified. 

Any drain fittings installed should be made of plastic to ensure electrical isolation of the fountain from the building's plumbing system.

**Installation Instructions:**
- Securely mount the fountain according to the rough-in location specified.
- Avoid soldering tubes that are inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings.
- Connect the water supply and adjust as necessary.
