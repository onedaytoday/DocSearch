To ensure a smooth and accurate installation, please review these straightforward instructions before proceeding. Verify that your installation adheres to all relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes. Refer to these instructions as you install the fountain. It is standard practice to ground electrical equipment, such as telephones and computers, to water lines, either within or outside the building. This grounding can result in electrical feedback to the fountain, leading to electrolysis that may impart a metallic taste or increase the metal content of the water. This issue can be prevented by using the specified materials. Any drain fittings provided by the installer must be made of plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the building's plumbing system. 

For the cooler installation, connect the cold water supply service stop to the unplated copper tube (not supplied). Pay attention to the water flow direction and ensure the waste outlet is in the recommended location. The wall must be reinforced in indicated areas for proper support.

Install the fountain in the shown position, following ANSI A117.0 standards. Use the appropriate screws and washers to securely fasten the assembly. The fountain should be connected to the unplated copper water supply by turning the supply on completely. **Important:** Do not solder tubes that are inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. 

Note that the operating pressure should be within specified PSIG limits, and deviations from this may affect warranty coverage. If the supply height varies significantly from the factory specifications, adjust the height using a screwdriver, turning clockwise or counter-clockwise as necessary.

For troubleshooting and maintenance, please refer to the provided parts list and diagrams. For replacement parts, contact your local distributor or call Elkay Manufacturing Company. When installing replacement components such as the bubbler and pedestal, only tighten the nut enough to hold the parts securely in placeâ€”avoid over-tightening.
