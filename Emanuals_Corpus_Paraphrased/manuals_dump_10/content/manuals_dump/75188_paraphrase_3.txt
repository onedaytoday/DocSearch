This works in conjunction with Convection settings like Warm, Defrost, Proof, and Perfect Cooking, allowing for versatile cooking at temperatures up to 450°F. To set this, select either the UPPER or LOWER OVEN, press BAKE, then select COOK OPTIONS for various cooking methods. After choosing COOK TIME, press START for the oven to begin heating. You can cancel or halt cooking at any point using the CANCEL button.

The **END TIME** feature also permits scheduled shut-off after a set time, utilizing similar steps as COOK TIME. This allows for automated cooking while ensuring that food is done safely, especially meats and poultry that require careful cooking management.

**Fire Safety Precautions:** In case of a fire, do not use water; instead, smother flames with a cover or use a fire extinguisher. Avoid covering grease fires with a cloth, as this can aggravate the situation.

**SABBATH FEATURE** 
This setting is designed for use on Jewish Sabbath holidays. Activate the BAKE function, set your desired temperature (up to a maximum of 350°F), and the oven will maintain this setting continuously without manual intervention. Important notes include that this feature should only be used with the BAKE function and cannot be cancelled or switched during its operation. To activate, select the desired oven, set the temperature, and press START.

### SABBATH FEATURE (CONTINUED)

To initiate the Sabbath feature, press the UPPER OVEN button followed by OVEN BAKE to set the temperature to 425°F, then press START twice. If you need to cancel, press the OFF button. Should you need to turn the oven off during Sabbath, press both HI and LO for at least five seconds. The oven may automatically resume when temperature conditions are met.

### USING THE SELF-CLEAN FEATURE

#### Cleaning Precautions
Ensure the oven cools before cleaning. Wear protective gear when manually cleaning. Parents should keep children away during the self-cleaning process, which may generate excessive heat. Avoid the use of aggressive cleaners or coatings during self-cleaning, as this can damage the oven’s interior. Do not use high-temperature cooking methods or allow food residue that may ignite during the cleaning cycle.

#### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle
To start the self-cleaning, ensure the oven is closed. Select either UPPER OVEN or LOWER OVEN, then press CLEAN, choosing the desired cleaning duration: LIGHT for one hour, MEDIUM for two hours, or HEAVY for three hours. Press START. The DOOR indicator will flash as the self-cleaning cycle begins. Once the cycle is complete, the oven will cool down, and the DOOR light will illuminate. If needed, you can press CANCEL after the cooling period.

### GENERAL CLEANING
For routine cleaning, turn off the oven and allow it to cool. Manage spills and heavy soiling immediately to reduce the need for major cleanings later. Use mild cleaning solutions for painted, decorative, and chrome surfaces, avoiding harsh chemicals that could scratch the finish. Lightly apply cleaner to grease and wipe with a cloth or towel.

### OVEN LIGHT 
The oven light operates when the oven is closed and can be controlled via a switch located on the front. It's essential that the glass shield is in place whenever the oven is in use. To replace the bulb, ensure the oven is cool, turn off the power, and handle the shield carefully to avoid damage.

### BROILER PAN CLEANING TIPS
After using the broiler, avoid covering the pan with foil. Clean up any grease immediately after cooking to prevent buildup.

### COMMON ISSUES
If the oven malfunctions or displays error codes, press CANCEL to reset, and contact an authorized service technician if necessary. 

Should you experience issues with the self-cleaning function, ensure the door is properly closed and that you followed the instructions accurately. Excessive smoke during broiling may indicate that the meat is too close to the heating element or that grease has accumulated. Adjust positioning and ensure the oven is adequately preheated to avoid curling and excessive grease buildup.

For any other performance issues, refer to the troubleshooting section of your manual.
