## Autodry Function for Synthetic Fabrics

### Overview
The autodry feature for synthetic fabrics operates continuously. To select the desired options, simply use the buttons provided. When drying synthetics, it's essential to choose appropriate settings to avoid excessive heat; turn off the system when the drying cycle is complete. 

### Drying Instructions
Follow the provided guidelines carefully for drying and sorting items. Separate laundry into the following categories: whites, colored items, synthetics, regular cottons, towels, and linens. It's important to wash new colored items separately from whites to maintain whiteness. Items like pillowcases can be washed with lighter colors. When drying synthetics, avoid overloading the machine, as this can reduce efficiency.

### Washing Guidelines
Ensure that items rated for washing at 60°C are treated properly in the washer-dryer. If prewash is selected, use appropriate additives; follow the recommended guidelines for detergent amounts. Do not mix items that require different washing temperatures. Thoroughly clean the machine, especially the lint filters and catchment areas, to maintain optimal performance.

### Cleaning Procedures
Regularly clean the lint filter and other parts of the machine to prevent blockages. Disconnect the machine from the power supply before cleaning. If the water supply is cut off or if there are issues with the drainage hose, clear any blockages and ensure connections are secure. For any malfunction warnings (E10, E20, E40), check that hoses are properly attached and not obstructed.

### Technical Specifications
Refer to the rating plate for specific technical information, such as water supply height and compatible settings for various fabric types (synthetics, wool, etc.). 

### Safety Precautions
Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions to avoid fire hazards and ensure safe operation. Ensure that hoses are not kinked or damaged and that all connections are secure before starting the machine.

**Paraphrased Text:**

To ensure proper installation of the washer-dryer, the positioning of feet should be securely tightened. This ensures that both operation and water hose connections are optimally configured. When setting up, it's imperative to connect the water supply hose properly, making sure it has the correct threading, and adjust its length if necessary.

If the existing hose is insufficient, it may be necessary to acquire a specially designed hose from an authorized supplier. For optimal function, the hose should allow a downward flow and should not exceed certain limits. Always ensure that the installed hose, particularly the U-bend, maintains an internal diameter appropriate for the appliance.

If the drainage outlet is blocked, it is crucial to ensure the hose is running unobstructed to prevent water accumulation or leakage. Avoid covering the hose with materials like carpeting that could lead to potential breakdowns.

The washer-dryer must connect to a properly earthed power supply as indicated on the rating plate. Ensure that wires are connected consistent with standard color codes: earth (yellow/green), neutral (blue), and live (brown/red). Safety precautions are critical to prevent electrical shock.

For built-in installation, follow guidelines to prevent hoses from becoming pinched. Ensure that all connections and screws are secure, and adjust the height as needed. Use countersunk screws for a flush fit, allowing clearance for operation.

For proper disposal of this appliance, follow local recycling regulations. Information on recycling can typically be obtained from your retailer or local service provider.

Warranty claims related to manufacturing defects are valid within a set period from purchase. Ensure that the appliance is operated and maintained per the user manual. Any unauthorized repairs can void the warranty.
