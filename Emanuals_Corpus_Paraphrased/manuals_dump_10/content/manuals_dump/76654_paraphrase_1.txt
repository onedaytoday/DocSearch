**Remember:** These instructions are designed for your safety and the longevity of your generator. Thoroughly read and understand all sections before operating.

### Equipment Description

**Field Specifications:** The equipment includes an internally mounted sound-attenuated system, featuring protective components according to the specified AC standards, which encompass leads from the input to the switch. It is designed with NEMA MG1 specifications for insulation class and construction, ensuring compliance with performance standards outlined in NEMA MG1-32.6 and NEMA MG1-1.66. 

**Engine Oil Recommendations:** For optimal operation, it is advised to use high-quality engine oil rated 15W-40, classified under Service CC, SD, SE, SF by the factory. Alternative options include SAE 30W or 15W-40 at temperatures above C, and SAE 20W-20 or 15W-40 below C. Note that at temperatures below 5°F, synthetic oil can be used to ensure proper crank action. 

**Coolant Recommendations:** The coolant should meet specific chemical and performance standards with calcium chromate to prevent overheating. Caution should be taken to avoid burns and exposure when handling coolant. 

**Engine Protective Devices:** The equipment is equipped with essential protective switches that prevent operation under unsafe conditions, such as high temperatures or low oil pressure. 

- **High Coolant Temperature Switch:** This switch initiates a shutdown at a coolant temperature of 200°F. 
- **Low Coolant Level Sensor:** This sensor prevents overheating by signaling when coolant levels drop below a safe threshold. 
- **Low Oil Pressure Switch:** This switch monitors oil pressure during operation; if pressure falls below a threshold, it triggers a shutdown and an alert is issued. 

If any fault occurs, the system enters an overcrank shutdown mode, indicated by an LED light, and the AUTO/OFF/MANUAL switch must be reset accordingly. 

**Fuel System Requirements:** 

- For buildings using propane (LP), the fuel supply should have a minimum diameter, and the line length should not exceed specified limits. Natural gas systems require appropriate line sizes to ensure efficient operation.
  
**Specifications:**

- **Generator Ratings:** The generator specifications include synchronous and insulation class ratings, harmonic distortion, and specific power ratings adhering to international standards.
- **Cooling System:** Features include a coolant recovery system and designated heat rejection parameters.
- **Electrical System:** A static battery charger is specified, alongside recommended battery specifications to ensure optimal performance under defined conditions.

**Generator Connection Box:** 

- A cold weather kit (part 0F6148) is recommended for optimal performance during low temperatures. 

**Reconfiguring the Fuel System:** Transitioning from natural gas (NG) to propane (LP) requires specific steps, including shutting off the gas supply and tightening hose connections appropriately.

**Generator AC Lead Connections:** The generator can support both single-phase and three-phase configurations, with leads connected according to factory specifications.

**Safety Notice:** Proper installation and handling are crucial for safety. Consult authorized service personnel for any assistance needed.

### Installation and Pre-Start-Up Procedures for QT Product

This section outlines the necessary steps to ensure proper installation and preparation of the QT product before startup. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure optimal performance. For any follow-up service or information, refer to the section on Service Transfer Switches.

If the transfer switch is needed to supply power under normal conditions, it is crucial to understand how to prevent backfeeding. The switch must be correctly positioned, mounted, and connected to the fuel system, ensuring it is fully purged and tested according to specifications.

#### Generator Set Lubrication
Ensure that the crankcase is filled according to the specifications outlined below. The unit is shipped with oil; however, a check is necessary after a certain number of operating hours. Ensure the oil meets SAE specifications. Before starting the engine for the first time, make sure it is serviced with the recommended coolant.

#### Electrical System Checks
The electrical system must be correctly grounded and interconnected. Verify that all wires are organized and free from obstructions. Conduct an initial inspection prior to starting the QT genset. Check the following:
- Battery condition
- Gear functionality
- AC and DC grounding

#### Start-Up Checklist
Ensure the AUTO/OFF/MANUAL switch is in the OFF position, and disconnect the 120VAC supply. Prior to startup, confirm that the battery charger is functioning correctly and that all wiring is secure. Inspect hoses for any damage and ensure they are correctly seated. Once everything is checked, set the switch to MANUAL and attempt to crank the engine. Observe the phase rotation to ensure it is correct.

To initiate startup, turn the AUTO/OFF/MANUAL switch to AUTO and ensure proper connections. 

#### Maintenance Schedule
Authorized service should be performed at the following intervals:
- Inspect the AUTO/OFF/MANUAL switch and the 15A circuit.
- Every three months, visually inspect devices and switches.
- Every six months, perform in-depth inspections.
- Annually, clean and inspect the cooling system.

#### Engine Coolant and Fluid Levels
Regularly check fluid levels, including engine oil and coolant. Use a clean cloth for checking and maintain levels within the specified range. Engine coolant should meet the recommended specifications. Inspect the cooling system for proper functionality.

#### Operator Maintenance Responsibilities
Operators should perform regular checks on:
- Engine oil level and battery connections
- Cooling system hoses
- Exhaust system security
- Fan belt tension
- Engine governor settings

Ensure any maintenance, such as oil changes, is executed by authorized personnel following specified procedures.

For any queries or issues, please refer to the manufacturer's authorized service facilities.

**SPARK PLUGS MAINTENANCE**  
To ensure optimal performance, clean the area around the spark plugs and inspect them according to the Service Section's recommendations. Set the spark plug gap to the specified measurement, and perform a coolant change at an Authorized Service Facility, following the cooling system specifications. 

**GENERATOR CLEANING & MAINTENANCE**  
Maintain the generator by cleaning internal components to prevent the buildup of contaminants. Utilize a cloth or designated cleaning materials for external cleaning, ensured to be suitable for all-weather use. 

Conduct thorough inspections regularly, especially focusing on insulation integrity. Address any visible damage. If the insulation shows signs of wear, consult specific maintenance instructions for the battery. 

**BATTERY MAINTENANCE**  
Do not attempt to crank or recharge the battery in enclosed spaces. Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent the risk of fire. If any part of the battery is affected by damage, isolate it from power sources immediately. When handling the battery, wear protective gear to avoid burns or injury.

Inspect all battery terminals regularly, tightening and cleaning as needed. Fill cells with distilled water only—avoid using tap water. 

**SERVICE SCHEDULE**  
Follow the outlined service schedule for routine checks and maintenance based on usage hours. Inspections should be done monthly, especially in critical areas, ensuring the generator is ready for operation. 

**TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**  
For any issues, identify the problem, possible causes, and corrections. Ensure all mechanical connections are clean and secure. Troubleshoot electrical components, including switches and boards, to confirm functionality.
