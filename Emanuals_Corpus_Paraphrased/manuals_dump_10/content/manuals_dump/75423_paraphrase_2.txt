**Safety Precautions:**
Read and understand all warnings and operating instructions prior to using this equipment to mitigate the risk of injury or property damage. 

**Key Safety Measures:**
1. Always wear eye and hearing protection, complying with ANSI Z87.1 and ANSI S3.19 standards.
2. Wear suitable clothing to prevent entanglement and use proper footwear.
3. Ensure the workspace is safe and well-maintained.
4. Frequently check for damaged parts and replace or repair as necessary.
5. Keep the work area organized and free of distractions, avoiding potential accidents.

**Operational Guidelines:**
- Never leave the machine running unattended.
- Disconnect power before servicing or repairing the machine.
- Keep children and bystanders away from the work area.
- Use appropriate extension cords to avoid overheating.
- Secure workpieces properly and always feed them against the blade rotation.

**Dust and Airborne Particles:**
Be aware that operating this machine may generate dust, including potentially hazardous substances like wood dust and silica. Use appropriate respiratory protection as per NIOSH/OSHA guidelines.

**Electrical Safety:**
Ensure the machine is grounded properly to protect against electric shock. If unsure, consult a qualified electrician to verify that the outlet is suitable and grounded per regulations.

**Final Reminders:**
Always prioritize safety by adhering to these guidelines and maintaining awareness of your surroundings while operating this equipment. Ensure to review this manual regularly and share it with others.

**Extension Cords and Grounding Considerations**

When selecting extension cords, ensure they are adequately heavy-duty to prevent overheating and match the appropriate grounding type. Refer to Diagram D-1, which illustrates suitable cord lengths and thicknesses. 

**Important Note**
The accompanying photo does not depict all items included in the package. Heavy items are shipped securely. 

**Unpacking and Cleaning**
Remove the protective coating from all items using a cloth or appropriate solvent. 

**Assembly**
Required tools for assembly and the estimated assembly time are outlined. It is important to wait until the machine is fully assembled before connecting it to a power source. Read the entire instruction manual carefully.

**Machine Lifting Precautions**
Due to its weight, at least four individuals should assist in lifting the machine onto a stand or workbench. Follow the guidelines for securing the cutting head during the lifting process.

**Assembling the Top Cover and Dust Chute**
Attach the top cover to the machine using the supplied screws appropriately. 

**Operational Controls and Adjustments**
- **Starting and Stopping the Planer**: Use the ON/OFF switch at the front. Confirm the switch is turned off before plugging in the power cord. In case of a power failure, ensure the switch is set to OFF to prevent accidental startups.
- **Switch Locking**: To prevent unauthorized use, the OFF switch should be secured.

**Depth of Cut Adjustment**
Adjust the head assembly to achieve the desired cutting depth, ensuring it is set above the cutter head for optimal operation.

**Feed Speed Control**
Change speeds only while the motor is running. Adjustments should reflect the desired smoothness of the finished product.

**Anti-Kickback Fingers Inspection**
Always disconnect the machine from the power source before inspecting or cleaning the anti-kickback fingers. Ensure they are functioning correctly and are properly aligned.

**Adjusting Belt Tension**
Disconnect power before adjusting belt tension. Correct belt tension can be assessed using lighting tools.

**Knife Checking, Adjusting, and Replacing**
Exercise caution when handling knives as they are sharp. Disconnect power before any knife removal. When reinstalling, secure them adequately but avoid overtightening initially.

**Gage Block Construction**
Establish a gage block to measure the chipbreaker, infeed, and outfeed heights. 

**Chipbreaker Height Adjustment**
Ensure the chipbreaker is properly aligned with the cutter head. Adjust as necessary, disconnecting the power as required.

**Infeed and Outfeed Roller Height Adjustments**
Both infeed and outfeed heights should be checked and adjusted for precision. Always disconnect power prior to making these adjustments.

Ensure to follow all safety protocols strictly throughout the assembly, operation, and maintenance of the machine.

### Adjusting Spring Tension of Infeed and Outfeed Rollers

To adjust the spring tension of the infeed and outfeed rollers, ensure they are set correctly while planing. The board should pass through without excessive tightness. The tension for both rollers can be managed with screws labeled as (A) for the infeed and (B) for the outfeed. For the infeed tension, locate the screws (A), with four threads visible on the casting. To increase or decrease tension, adjust screws (A) accordingly. For the outfeed tension, locate screws (B), with one thread visible on the casting. Similar adjustments should be made with screws (B).

### Adjusting Table Rollers

To reduce friction while feeding material through the machine, adjust the height of the table rollers (A). This should be set based on the thickness of the material being processed—higher settings for rough stock and lower for smoother materials. To make these adjustments, first, **DISCONNECT MACHINE FROM POWER SOURCE**, then adjust the height with screws (D) or (E) as needed. It’s crucial that screws (E) are both adjusted equally for proper functioning. To raise or lower the table, turn screws (E) clockwise or counterclockwise accordingly.

### Adjusting Cutting Head Parallel to Table

To ensure the cutting head is parallel to the table, further adjustments may be required after factory settings. **DISCONNECT MACHINE FROM POWER SOURCE** and check alignment by placing the head casting (B) against the top of the table (A) to verify proper contact at the front. If adjustments are needed, use the steps outlined for securing the assembly (E) sufficiently. Turn screw (F) carefully—it is sensitive and shouldn't require more than one or two teeth of adjustment. Clockwise rotation lowers the casting, while counterclockwise raises it.

### Machine Usage

When operating the machinery, be sure to consistently use thin stock and follow each thickness step appropriately for optimal performance. Avoid feeding wood through the same spot on the table repeatedly, as this can lead to uneven knife wear. Instead, vary the feeding positions to prolong the life of the cutting knives. For periodic maintenance, lubricate as instructed.

### Delta Lubrication and Maintenance

Regular lubrication is essential; refer to the provided diagrams (A, B) to access the appropriate screws (C, D) for application. Make sure to keep the machine clean using a cloth, and do not allow debris to accumulate as it can hinder performance.

### Troubleshooting and Warranty Support

In case of malfunction, consult the troubleshooting section or reach out to Delta’s factory service or authorized service stations for support regarding parts, warranty claims, or servicing. For additional information on service locations or warranty registration, visit www.deltamachinery.com.

### Cleaning and Care

To protect cast iron surfaces from rust, use WD-40 and Scotch-Brite for cleaning, followed by applying TopCote for protection.
