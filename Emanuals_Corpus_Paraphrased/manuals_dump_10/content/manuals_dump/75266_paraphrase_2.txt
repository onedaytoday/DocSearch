### IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 

To mitigate the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury, adhere to the following warnings and instructions: 

1. Ensure proper installation and grounding as per National ANSI/NFPA (U.S.A.) or CSA C22.1 standards. Consult authorized service for assistance.
2. Prior to connecting to power, allow the appliance to acclimate to room temperature for at least 2 hours if exposed to extreme temperatures.
3. Any servicing not explicitly mentioned in this manual should be performed by trained technicians to prevent hazards.
4. Keep flammable materials, including cloth items, cookbooks, and plastics, away from the appliance to avoid fire hazards.

**Children's Safety:** 
- Ensure children are supervised and are not left alone around the appliance. 
- Do not permit access to the hot surfaces of the oven until cooled.

**Fire Safety:** 
- To extinguish grease fires, cover the fire with a metal lid or use a foam-type extinguisher. Avoid water.
- Do not heat unopened food containers to prevent them from bursting.

### IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING YOUR OVEN

- Ensure all ducts are unobstructed during operation.
- Avoid touching heating elements and hot surfaces during and immediately after use to prevent burns.

### IMPORTANT CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS

- Regularly clean the oven to prevent grease buildup, which can ignite.
- Always follow recommended cleaning products and procedures to avoid accidents.

### CONTROL PAD FUNCTIONS

Refer to the below instructions for satisfactory operation of controls:

- **Convection:** Used for convection cooking.
- **Preheat:** Initiates the preheating process.
- **Clean:** Starts the cleaning cycle.
- **Light:** Turns the oven light on or off.
- **Clock:** Sets or displays the time.

### SETTING THE CLOCK 

To set the clock:

1. Press the relevant button; "CLO" will appear.
2. Adjust the time using the hour/minute buttons.
3. Hold until the confirmation sound is heard.

### ADDITIONAL FUNCTION SETTINGS

Settings for Continuous Bake, Kitchen Timer, and Oven Lockout are explained in detail in the manual.

### TEMPERATURE DISPLAY SETTINGS

Adjust between Fahrenheit and Celsius as needed with a specific button press sequence.

### ADJUSTING OVEN TEMPERATURE

Modify the oven temperature from its factory settings, increasing or decreasing by specified increments as needed.

### PREHEATING INSTRUCTIONS 

For optimal cooking results, preheat the oven as specified for various recipes. Follow the instructions for setting the desired temperature and ensure the preheat indicator is displayed.

For further details on operation, maintenance, or troubleshooting, please refer to the respective sections of this manual.

### BAKING

To preheat, follow the specific instructions provided. If preheating is necessary, set the oven temperature to 350°F (as indicated below). To reach 350°F, monitor the indicator lights or sounds until they signal readiness. If preheating is required for higher temperatures (e.g., 425°F), ensure the oven is already at 350°F before adjusting. Proper air circulation is vital to achieve even cooking. Ensure the food items are spaced adequately, allowing heat to circulate freely. 

When preparing cookies, breads, cakes, or meats, avoid overcrowding the oven, as this can lead to uneven cooking or slower heat transfer. Be sure to follow the size and weight recommendations within the provided charts for optimal results. If using multiple racks, allow enough clearance for proper airflow.

### CONVECTION BAKING

Convection cooking utilizes heated air circulated around the food for even cooking. This method is effective for both baking and roasting. Experiment with batch cooking or defrosting, with adjustments to cooking times based on the type and quantity of food. Utilize convection settings at appropriate temperatures, ensuring heat is evenly distributed. 

If using racks during convection baking, maintain appropriate spacing among food items to maximize heating efficiency. Refer to recommendations for adjusting cook times based on your specific food items.

### TIMED BAKE OR TIMED CONVECTION BAKE

To use the timed bake feature, select your cooking temperature—e.g., set to 350°F—and adjust the timer to the desired cooking time. The oven will automatically turn off once the cycle is complete. Monitor the settings by checking indicators for when the oven achieves the correct temperature. 

Ensure food items are prepared according to food safety guidelines, including prompt serving after cooking to avoid any risk of foodborne illnesses.

### DELAYED TIMED BAKE OR DELAYED TIMED CONVECTION BAKE

For delayed cooking, set your desired temperature and timing, ensuring that items can be safely stored prior to cooking. Follow the same steps as for the timed bake, but select delayed settings carefully, ensuring the food won’t exceed safe storage limits.

### BROILING

Preheat the broiler for effective searing. To do this, set the broiler and wait for it to reach optimal temperatures, usually around 550°F. Season your food and manage the cooking closely to avoid burning. Be aware of splatter and grease build-up; if a grease fire occurs, turn off the oven and use a fire extinguisher if necessary.

### CONVECTION ROASTING

Utilize convection roasting options for even cooking. Ensure there is sufficient space around the food for effective hot air circulation. Monitor grease catchment to maintain a safe environment during cooking.

### STARTING SELF-CLEAN CYCLE

When initiating the self-cleaning feature, ensure the oven is cool, as this cycle typically takes several hours. Activate the cycle based on the heaviness of accumulated residues. The oven will become extremely hot, so ensure children and pets are kept at a safe distance. 

Once the cleaning cycle is complete, allow the oven to cool before reusing. The oven will signal when it is finished and safe to open.

### Cleaning Instructions

**To Initiate the Delayed Self-Clean Cycle:**
To start the self-cleaning process, use the designated controls. If the clock is not set correctly, the self-clean function may not activate as expected. After initiating, the self-cleaning will run automatically for a set number of hours, including a cool-down period. During the self-clean cycle, expect the “DOOR LOCKED” indicator to flash, indicating the oven is locked for safety.

**General Cleaning Guidelines:**
It’s crucial to address spills and heavy soil immediately to minimize the need for extensive cleaning later on. Routine maintenance will help reduce the frequency of major cleanings. For painted surfaces and decorative chrome, utilize a damp cloth and mild cleaner to remove grease—avoid abrasive cleaners to prevent scratching. If necessary, cover areas to protect from splashes during regular cleaning.

**Oven Light:**
The oven light is activated when the door is closed. Ensure the protective glass shield is clean and in place while the oven is operational. To replace the light, ensure the oven is cool and follow safety precautions.

### Common Issues and Service Information

If error codes (F1 through F10) appear, pressing the CANCEL button may resolve the issue. For persistent problems, contact an authorized service technician. Should the oven fail to operate post-installation or if the power supply is compromised (e.g., tripped breaker), ensure connections are secure.

**Light and Self-Cleaning Malfunctions:**
If the oven light isn’t functioning, check for a burned-out bulb. Follow the manufacturer’s guidelines for replacement. If the self-cleaning cycle is interrupted, consult the instructions to safely resume or stop the process.

**Cooking Issues:**
Excessive smoke during broiling may indicate too much grease. Adjust the placement of meat for adequate clearance and manage preheating to avoid issues with smoking or flare-ups.
