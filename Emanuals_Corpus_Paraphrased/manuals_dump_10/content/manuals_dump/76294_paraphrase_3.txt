This manual is designed to help you understand your washing machine's features, enhance laundry efficiency, and ensure safety during operation.

The hose is fitted with threading and has been extended. If the hose is excessively long, it may be necessary to acquire a more suitable type, specifically the P0021 model. This setup allows the hose to connect effectively, ensuring proper function. 

**IMPORTANT:** The hose should be maintained at its maximum rated capacity (as indicated on the specification plate). It should not be twisted, as improper handling of the hoses can lead to operational issues. If a P0254 error arises, cross-check the specifications as indicated on the plate. Ensure that the equipment matches the stated ratings without compromise or modifications. Additionally, safe grounding is essential, particularly for outlets requiring such configurations. 

Choosing appropriate cleaning products (like cleaners, chainsaws, and lawn mowers) should align with regulations across USD among different countries and regions.
