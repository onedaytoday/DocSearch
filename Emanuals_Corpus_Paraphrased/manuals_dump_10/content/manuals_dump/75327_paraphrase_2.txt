### Function Preservation: 

The heating mechanism operates with either a twist-off mechanism or an adjustable type, ensuring the initial temperature effectively preserves the function. This system should be utilized in such a way that the containers are not in contact with one another. Adjust the temperature to 100°C; this is the optimal setting for preserving soft fruits like pears, peas, and beans. When the device is turned off, it can still maintain a cooking temperature of 100°C for preservation.

### Drying Function:

To utilize the drying function, cover the shelves with greaseproof paper and switch off the appliance. Allow the food to cool overnight. Dried foods, such as mushrooms, apricots, apples, and pears, will typically require several hours at around 60°C.

### Cleaning and Safety Instructions:

Before cleaning, ensure the device is off and has completely cooled. For safety reasons, avoid using high-pressure cleaners or abrasive scrubbing pads. Instead, clean the surfaces with a soft cloth and appropriate cleaning agent. Adhere to the specified cleaning instructions carefully. Detachable accessories can be cleaned individually or placed in the dishwasher. 

### Lighting Precautions:

For safety against electrical shock, switch off power to the light fixture before handling. Remove and clean the light cover by turning it anti-clockwise; replace with a heat-resistant bulb if necessary.

### Heating System Maintenance:

Use caution when cleaning the heating elements. Make sure the appliance is off before handling or repositioning any heating components. Gently remove the heating shelf from its hinges by lifting it forward. When reassembling, ensure all elements are secured in place.
