This manual is designed to provide you with comprehensive guidance for effective and safe usage of your appliance.

To manually activate the FAST CHILL/-FREEZE function, you need to toggle the recessed switch. The appliance can be switched off using a child-proof mechanism designed for safety. To deactivate the function, press and hold the ON/OFF button for several seconds; a countdown timer will indicate when the function is being switched off. 

For defrosting and cleaning, ensure that the appliance is set to stand-by mode at +15°C. If left unmonitored, this can prevent mold formation. To adjust the temperature, turn the dial counterclockwise to increase it to +10°C, then to +15°C as needed. 

Warnings will activate if the temperature exceeds +5°C, resulting in flashing lights and alarm sounds. These alerts will inform you of any high temperature issues or thawing events affecting food quality.

If there is a temporary power interruption, the thaw warning will activate to indicate potential thawing of stored items. If a fault occurs, an error code (F1 to F7) will display, notifying you of the issue which will require a service technician to resolve. 

Organize food on shelves with consideration for height, positioning heavier items towards the back and lighter ones at the front. Ensure that bottles are arranged with the neck facing forward to aid in accessibility. 

Food should ideally be stored below -18°C to maintain freshness, and it is advisable to monitor temperatures regularly using a thermometer. Contact local food safety authorities for further guidance if needed. 

During defrosting, remove built-up frost from the compartment when it reaches a significant thickness. It is recommended to defrost at least once a year and to use heat sources with caution to avoid damaging plastics. 

For cleaning, always disconnect from the electricity supply first. Regular maintenance should include thorough cleaning of surfaces while avoiding harmful cleaning agents. 

Operational sounds from the unit are normal, including whirring from the thermostat and airflow sounds. Ensure no obstructions are present to allow for efficient cooling.

In case of faults or the need for service, please refer to the technical guidelines provided. This appliance adheres to relevant EU regulations for household appliances, ensuring safety and efficiency in operation.
