The device displays the selected settings. Access the ALARM and ALARM MODE functions, which are applicable only for the current DAY OF WEEK. To proceed, release the ALARM MODE and adjust the necessary settings. Verify the selected ALARM by pressing the respective buttons. The display indicates the currently selected DAY OF WEEK. After adjusting, press the RADIO ON/OFF button to activate it. Set the BAND to either AM or FM and adjust the VOLUME to a suitable level that isn't excessively loud. Use the TUNING function and either press or hold to search for stations until a clear reception is found. Once the desired station is set, finalize the VOLUME adjustment and turn the RADIO OFF when complete. 

For recalling station memory, ensure the radio is ON and the desired BAND (AM or FM) is selected. Press "P XX" to identify the memory location of the currently tuned station. To cycle through memory locations, use "P XX" to navigate. The memory location displays for several seconds when accessed. 

To store a station: ensure the RADIO is ON and set to the chosen BAND, then press MEMORY to save this station in the indicated memory location. While "P XX" shows, navigate and save additional stations similarly. The AM and FM receptions can vary based on the internal mechanics and AC connection. 

Regarding alarm sounds, you can toggle between "BUZZER" and the RADIO for your alarm. The selected sound will activate at the designated hour and then turn off automatically. Ensure the ALARM is set correctly, including any necessary adjustments for the alarm flash. Utilize the SNOOZE/SLEEP function to adjust the countdown for automatic shut-off. 

To modify the DIMMER setting, note that it is typically preset to High. If the display is too bright, adjust accordingly. The built-in lithium battery will eventually need replacing to maintain functionality, typically after several years depending on usage and environmental factors. Ensure AC power is connected to safeguard memory retention.

To replace the lithium battery, procure a 3V lithium CR2032 battery. Carefully open the casing, noting the small screw, and replace the battery while following safety precautions to prevent potential hazards. If the unit loses power, the clock may need to be reset, including the DAY OF WEEK and MONTH/DATE settings.
