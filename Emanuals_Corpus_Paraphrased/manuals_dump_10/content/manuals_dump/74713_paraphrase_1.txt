### Important Safety Instructions

For your safety, adhere to these guidelines. For installation, ensure the appliance is positioned according to specifications and not exposed to heat sources. When moving the appliance, exercise caution due to its weight. Always allow the freezer to stabilize for several hours before first use. Avoid placing perishable items in the unit until it has reached the appropriate temperature. 

Do not allow children to operate the freezer unsupervised, as this can lead to hazards, including suffocation. Regularly inspect the appliance for cooling efficiency and have it serviced by authorized technicians to prevent risks.

### Appliance Operation

The freezer features a fresh food compartment and includes various indicator lights. The yellow mains-on light indicates power is active, while the red warning light signals potential problems, such as an incorrect temperature. Adjust the thermostat as needed for optimal food preservation. 

Distribution of food should prioritize maintaining a consistent temperature within the appliance. Allow food to cool before placing it in the freezer to enhance efficiency and reduce frost buildup.

Regularly check the food, and if items show signs of freezer burn, consider discarding them. For proper thawing, adhere to specific food guidelines, ensuring they are fully cooked and safe to consume.

### Maintenance and Cleaning

For optimal performance, disconnect the freezer from the electricity supply before cleaning. Use soft, non-abrasive materials to clean the interior; avoid harsh detergents or highly scented cleaning products that can damage surfaces. Regular maintenance checks are essential to ensure longevity and functionality.
