### Instructions and Operation Manual for FTA1100

#### INTRODUCTION

This document provides guidance on the installation and operation of the FTA1100 system. It is important to read through these instructions carefully. For any issues not covered in this manual, please contact technical support or the factory.

#### MOUNTING CONTROLLER

**Wall Mount Procedure:**
Select a suitable mounting location for the controller. Ensure the wall mount plate is secured using appropriate anchors and washers for stability. Place the controller upright during installation and check that it's securely fastened. Use four anchors for mountingâ€”two at the top and two at the bottom of the mounting ears.

**Floor/Base Plate Mount Procedure:**
If applicable, unpack and inspect the floor mounting legs. Follow similar steps as the wall mount, ensuring that all connections are secure and that the unit is free from obstructions.

#### MAKING ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

It is essential to adhere to local electrical codes and regulations when connecting the system. Incoming AC power should be properly routed to the designated terminals (L1, L2, CB1, CB2, CB3) with appropriate grounding. Ensure that all wires are securely connected and that polarity is consistent.

#### MAKING SYSTEM PRESSURE CONNECTIONS

Connect the FTA1100 to the system using FNPT fittings. The fittings should be free of debris and installed according to NFPA standards.

#### PROGRAMMING THE MARK II XG

To power on the system, follow the provided instructions for initializing timers and interlocks. The interface will display various system statuses including AC power availability and any alarms.

#### MAIN MENU OPTIONS

- **Settings Adjustments:** Configure brightness, contrast, language, date, and time settings.
- **Event Logging and Data History:** Access logs and history through the main menu options.
- **Battery and Charger Information:** Monitor battery status including charging amperage and potential issues.

**Warning:** Incorrect installation or configuration may lead to operational failures or safety hazards. Ensure all settings are double-checked.

#### FINAL NOTES

Familiarize yourself with the menu interface and available settings. Regular maintenance checks are essential for optimal operation. If any issues arise that are not resolved within this manual, consult technical support.

**SETTINGS FOR PRESSURE AND ALARM CONFIGURATION**

1. **Pressure Settings:**
   - Adjust the overpressure alarm by using the directional arrows. 
   - Record pressure settings by pressing the designated button to set it to either hourly or delta recording. 
   - Ensure the current operating conditions of the pressure sensor are visible from this location.

2. **Calibration Settings:**
   - To calibrate, set the pressure to zero. If the readings do not match the expected values, utilize the appropriate terminals. 
   - Ensure the span is set correctly; reset to default settings if necessary.

3. **Engineer Cranking Settings:**
   - Select the type of cranking settings (Mechanical or Electrical) using the arrows. 
   - Record duration for each cranking operation.

4. **Overspeed and Alarm Limits:**
   - Enable the overspeed alarm by navigating through the settings. The alarm will be activated based on pre-set limits.
   - Configure the minimum and maximum alarm limits for battery and AC power status.

5. **Feature Settings:**
   - Enable or disable features such as low-pressure auditory alarms, interlocks, and manual test duration parameters.
   - Set up remote start functions, noting the necessary delay settings.

6. **System Notifications:**
   - Record messages for user inputs and acknowledge inputs through the alarm system. 
   - Implement weekly testing schedules with configurable options for when tests will occur.

7. **Temperature and Reservoir Controls:**
   - Activate alarms for low temperatures or reservoir levels, with optional auditory signals.

8. **Factory Configuration and Diagnostics:**
   - Access factory configurations including model details, battery types, and pressure sensors. 
   - Execute diagnostics for raw input/output to assist in troubleshooting.

9. **Boot and Test Procedures:**
   - Upon startup, perform lamp and audible tests to confirm functionality.
   - Conduct USB tests to ensure data integrity in writing and reading.

10. **Data Management:**
    - Clear data history and event logs with caution, as this data cannot be recovered once erased. 
    - Reset to default settings as necessary, allowing for recovery of both user-defined and factory configurations.

11. **Charger Information:**
    - Ensure the correct type of charger is being used (Lead Acid, NiMH, etc.), as discrepancies can affect charging performance.
    - Monitor charging indicators to confirm proper functioning and battery status.
