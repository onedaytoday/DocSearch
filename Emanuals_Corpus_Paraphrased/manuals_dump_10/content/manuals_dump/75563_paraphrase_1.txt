### SG and Instructions

**Introduction**  
This document serves as an introduction to the British C.E. Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It provides comprehensive guidelines to ensure safe and proper operation of the equipment.

**Operation Guidelines**  
Before using the device, ensure you are well-acquainted with these instructions. It's essential to adhere to the recommended guidelines for cooking safely and effectively. 

**Rating Plate Information**  
The rating plate, typically located on the front, back, or top of the unit, indicates the model's specifications and compliance information.

**Lighting the Hotplate**  
To ignite the hotplate, turn the control to the highest setting and release it immediately. **Warning**: If the flame goes out, do not attempt to reignite until the hotplate has cooled down to prevent fire hazards. Always ensure that necessary precautions are taken when lighting the unit.

**Cooking Techniques**  
Adjust the heat settings gradually from 'OFF' to 'LOW', then to 'HIGH', depending on the type of food being prepared. It's advisable to check cooking progress regularly. Use appropriate settings based on the thickness and type of food to ensure thorough cooking.

**Preheating and Positioning**  
Preheating is crucial for optimal cooking results—especially for items like meat and baked goods. Position food accurately on the shelves, counting from the top, to facilitate even heat distribution during cooking.

**Roasting Instructions**  
When roasting, cover food where appropriate to ensure proper heat circulation and cooking times. Always monitor items closely to prevent overcooking or burning.

**Cooking Chart Reference**  
Follow the cooking chart for recommended times and temperatures. Ensure meat is properly thawed before cooking and verify internal temperatures for safety.

**General Tips**  
Use cookware that can withstand high temperatures, avoid overcrowding the cooking area, and monitor food closely to ensure even cooking. If the hotplate catches fire, use a damp cloth to smother the flames and turn off the appliance. 

Please refer back to these instructions as needed to maintain safety and effectiveness in cooking.

### Cooking Instructions for Soups and Foods

To prepare soups and other foods, place them on the hotplate and cook at a suitable temperature. Ensure the ingredients are tightly covered to maintain moisture. Once the food reaches a sufficient cooking stage, allow it to simmer before reducing the heat. If using meat, fully thaw it beforehand. To thicken sauces, use cornstarch, but be cautious to prevent curdling during the cooking process. When reheating food, ensure it has cooled completely; do not reheat more than once, and use conventional or microwave methods.

### Cleaning Procedures

Maintaining cleanliness is crucial for safety. Clean up spills immediately to prevent risks of fire. Use recommended cleaning products and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines. To clean the hotplate, use a soft cloth and avoid abrasive materials. Ensure the crowns and other components are free from food residue to prevent smoking or burning during cooking. 

### Safety and Maintenance Guidelines

Follow the specific safety and operational instructions as outlined. The placement of the appliance must allow proper ventilation. Be aware of fire hazards, especially with flammable items. Regular cleaning will ensure the longevity and efficiency of your appliance.

### Technical Specifications

**Appliance Placement**: Ensure that the appliance is installed in a well-ventilated area and is away from moisture, particularly bathrooms and showers. The hotplate must be level and the installation should conform to local safety regulations. 

**Connections and Power Supply**: The appliance requires an appropriate battery and gas supply connections, as specified in the documentation.

**Stability**: Install stability brackets according to the recommended guidelines to ensure safety during use. Adjust the height where necessary to improve functionality.

For any further information or servicing needs, please contact the provided service channels.

### GAS CONNECTION INSTRUCTIONS

**Connecting to Gas:** Ensure that the gas inlet pipe is connected to the reset valve positioned beneath the hotplate, using R/8 B.S.P. threaded connections. **IMPORTANT:** Only liquid sealants should be utilized when attaching the gas inlet pipe; do not use PTFE sealing tape. Ensure the gas supply line is sufficiently supported along its route. The flexible tubing must comply with the latest BS standards. LPG flexible connections should be rated for LPG use and must include a red stripe, band, or label.

### BATTERY INSTALLATION
The battery is located on the front plinth. To connect the battery, properly insert it into the designated area, ensuring all connections are secure.

### PRESSURE TESTING
Pressure testing can be conducted by removing the front cover. Ease off the right-hand cover while disconnecting the F.S.D. (Flame Sensing Device) phial, then connect it to the injector. To check the supply pressure, adjust the thermostat and activate the hotplate. It’s essential to turn off the supply and cover, confirming that the F.S.D. is properly aligned.

### CHECKING THE GRILL
Verify that the grill assembly is attached correctly. Activate the grill and ensure proper operation, confirming the release function works as expected.

### CHECKING THE HOTPLATE
Examine the crowns of the hotplate to ensure they are properly seated. Turn the hotplate on and observe that it functions correctly, releasing as intended.

### CHECKING THE LID CUT-OFF DEVICE
Activate the hotplate and ensure that gas supply is available. The supply should cease when the hotplate lid is closed.

### CHECKING THE MAIN OVEN
Adjust the thermostat to the appropriate setting and ignite the oven. The F.S.D. should activate to allow gas flow, while also being attentive to any overheating that might affect its operation. After testing, turn off the oven and ensure the safety cover is in its place.

### CHECKING THE SECOND OVEN
Rotate the thermostat counterclockwise to ignite the second oven. Confirm that gas flows correctly while the F.S.D. is active. Following the tests, make sure to turn off the oven and secure the necessary covers. 

### GENERAL NOTE
Users should familiarize themselves with the operation guidelines, as specified in the attached cover documentation.
