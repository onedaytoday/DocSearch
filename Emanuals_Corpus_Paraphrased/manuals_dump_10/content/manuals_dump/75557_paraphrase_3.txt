### Instructions for Use and Maintenance

**Burn Prevention and Rack Positioning**  
To prevent burns, ensure that shelves are arranged correctly. If using four cake layers, position them alternately to maximize heat circulation. Directly cover the shelf with cookware that fits properly. The shelves should be secured with stop-locks (labeled A through F).

**Preheating and Baking**  
Before baking, select the desired temperature on the BAKE function and press START/ON. The oven will preheat until it reaches the set temperature, indicated on the display. Proper preheating is essential for optimal results when baking cakes, cookies, and bread.

**Safety Precautions**  
When handling the lowest shelf (A), maintain a distance of at least a few inches from the heating element to avoid burns. Always use caution when removing food from the oven. 

**Cooking Temperature Guidelines**  
For food safety, ensure that meat is cooked to a minimum of 140°F, as per USDA guidelines. The cooking time should be adjusted based on the thickness of the item to ensure even cooking without over-browning.

**Clock and Timer Functions**  
To set the kitchen timer, touch the KITCHEN TIMER ON/OFF button. The clock feature allows you to track cooking times. Use the CLOCK button to display the current time or to turn the clock off. 

**Automatic Shut-Off Feature**  
The oven has a built-in shut-off feature that activates after a certain period. This is useful for unattended cooking. Adjust settings accordingly if cooking multiple items or if the timer exceeds the programmed time.

**Self-Cleaning Mode**  
For self-cleaning, follow the instructions precisely to ensure safety. Note that the cleaning cycle is automatic and should only be initiated when the oven is empty.

**Sabbath Mode Instructions**  
The oven includes a Sabbath mode, which allows for cooking while adhering to religious practices. Ensure you follow the instructions for activating this feature.

**Thermostat Calibration and Maintenance**  
If you suspect inaccurate temperatures, check the thermostat. Use an oven thermometer to verify its accuracy. If temperatures are consistently off, recalibrate or replace the thermostat as needed.

### Self-Cleaning Instructions for GE Appliances

To initiate the self-cleaning cycle, visit www.GEAppliances.com. Be aware that the heavy shelves, cookware, and oven components should not be cleaned in the self-clean mode; instead, they should be cleaned manually with appropriate cleaners. Use a soft cloth and non-abrasive cleansers for this purpose.

**Important Notes:**
- Ensure the latch is functioning correctly; if it appears jammed, allow the oven to cool down before retrying.
- Start the self-cleaning cycle by touching the "SELF CLEAN" or "START/ON" button. The process generally lasts several hours, depending on the selected clean duration. A countdown will appear once the cycle begins.
- Inspect the oven's interior for any signs of damage, including frayed or worn elements, and replace them if necessary.

**Cleaning Guidelines:**
- If you need to stop the self-cleaning cycle, press "CLEAR/OFF." Wait until the oven cools down sufficiently for safe handling before unlatched components and shelves.
- Use a damp cloth for wiping down the surfaces after the self-cleaning cycle concludes. If stubborn residues remain, apply suitable cleaning solutions and scrub gently.

**Safety Precautions:**
- Regularly check for any damaged parts, and if any components are worn or malfunctioning, replace them promptly to avoid health hazards.
- When cleaning, ensure the oven is turned off and cool to prevent injury. Avoid using scouring pads or abrasive materials on painted surfaces.

To resolve issues with your appliance, press the CLEAR/OFF button located on the back. If the self-cleaning function is activated, ensure the latch is secured. To initiate the self-cleaning cycle, press CLEAR/OFF and wait at least 30 seconds. If the operation light is flashing, it may indicate a miswired connection or a tripped circuit breaker. 

In the case of the clock flashing, set the clock to the correct time by pressing the CLEAR/OFF button. Allow the appliance to cool down for one hour after the self-cleaning cycle is complete. The oven's cleaning section may require maintenance if used frequently, and insulation can sometimes be compromised, leading to temporary issues.
