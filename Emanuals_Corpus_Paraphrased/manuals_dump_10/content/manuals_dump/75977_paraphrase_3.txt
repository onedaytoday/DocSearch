### INSTALLATION OF THE WINE COOLER

**Installation Types**   
The wine cooler can be installed either as a freestanding unit or built-in (refer to the relevant section of this manual). Ensure that the front is unobstructed.

**Site Preparation**  
Consider the weight of the unit when fully loaded. The cooler must be grounded and plugged into a 120V, 15A GFCI outlet in accordance with local electrical codes and ordinances.

**WARNING: ELECTROCUTION HAZARD!**  
Grounding is required. Use a three-prong (grounded) outlet to prevent shock hazards. Avoid using the appliance with two-prong adapters.

**Preparation of Clearance**  
Ensure proper clearance for air intake and exhaust around the cabinet or wall—specifics include a minimum clearance for airflow to the front. Follow the guidelines for installation and allow adequate ventilation.

### WINE RACKS WITH WOOD TRIM
The wine cooler features wooden racks that combine aesthetics with durability. The factory-applied clear finish should not be altered. **CAUTION:** For finishing purposes, ensure the surface is clean and dry before applying any stain or finish. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations, allowing sufficient drying time, as this could affect the warranty.

### RACK REMOVAL/INSTALLATION  
To remove or install racks, unscrew them as necessary. Clean moldings using a cloth, and apply a thin layer of a protective finish if desired. Follow instructions carefully, allowing drying times as specified. 

### LEVELING THE UNIT  
To level the cooler, adjust the four leveling feet by turning them clockwise or counterclockwise as needed. Check the unit’s level after adjustments.

### REVERSING THE DOOR  
The door can be adjusted to open from either side. Remove the plastic plugs and top screws using an appropriate wrench, then remount them in the desired location after relocating the top and bottom hinges as shown. 

Follow these steps carefully to ensure proper installation and function of your wine cooler.
