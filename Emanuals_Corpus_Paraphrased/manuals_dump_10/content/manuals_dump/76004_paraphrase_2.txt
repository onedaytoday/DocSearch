The compactor can be installed as either free-standing or built-in. For built-in configurations, it can be converted to a free-standing model by using the Toe Accessory ETC15TKH (sold separately). In a free-standing setup, proper adjustments must be made at the back of the unit to facilitate its operation. For built-in installations, it is essential to secure the unit to the countertop. Ensure that all mounting brackets are properly attached, taking care to align them as indicated in the installation instructions. 

Please note: When installing on countertops or cabinetry, it's crucial to adhere to the manufacturer's grounding instructions to avoid pinching the electrical cord during service. The cord should not obstruct the back of the compactor, and the electrical outlet should be positioned high enough to accommodate the installation. 

The compactor features four leveling legs that allow for height adjustments. Ensure that the screws are only tightened sufficiently to hold the unit in place. Use a wood block against the front of the compactor to help align it during installation. Ensure that the back slots are clear for mounting the screws.
