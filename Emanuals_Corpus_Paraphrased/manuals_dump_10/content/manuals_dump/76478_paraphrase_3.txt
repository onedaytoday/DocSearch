Ensure you remove packaging materials immediately. Keep items like plastic sheets away from children, as they can pose suffocation hazards.

**FOR CHILD SAFETY:**
Keep cords and packaging out of reach of children. 

**ELECTRICAL INFORMATION:**  
Ensure that the refrigerator is properly connected to a grounded AC outlet to prevent electrical shocks. The outlet should have a three-prong grounding mechanism. Adhere to local electrical codes to ensure safe operation. If there are any issues, disconnect the power source before servicing.

If necessary, remove the door carefully by unscrewing the relevant fasteners from the top and hinge.

Keep the fridge away from direct sunlight and heat-producing appliances. Do not overload it, as this can obstruct airflow and affect cooling. Ensure food items are properly wrapped to minimize moisture buildup.
