### COOLMATIC and FROSTMATIC Functions

The **COOLMATIC** feature enables efficient cooling, allowing users to select their desired temperature. Once activated, it maintains this temperature for a designated period. The system indicates the current temperature while automatically reverting to the original setting after the specified duration. Users can also manually control the COOLMATIC function, with an indicator light signaling its status.

The **FROSTMATIC** function is designed to quickly freeze fresh food items and safeguard previously frozen goods. Similar to COOLMATIC, it can be activated and manually managed, with an indicator light showing its operational status. If manually turned off, it will deactivate automatically after a set time.

#### Appliance Operation

To switch the appliance on or off, use the ON/OFF button. A countdown timer displays the remaining time until the appliance shuts down, with lights indicating the status. The appliance can only be completely disconnected from the power supply by unplugging it or switching the main power off.

#### Proper Use and Maintenance

For optimal performance, ensure the unit remains closed to prevent unintentional temperature changes which could lead to spoilage or mold growth. Adjust shelves and racks for height to maximize storage. Heavy items should be placed on lower shelves, while lighter goods can be stored higher.

It's important to keep certain products, such as meat, at the appropriate temperatures by monitoring with a thermometer and maintaining ideal storage conditions. Fresh food should be adequately covered to avoid contamination.

#### Alerts and Notifications

The appliance features warning indicators and tones for various conditions, such as when temperatures are too high or when there are issues with operational functionality. If a malfunction occurs, an acoustic alarm will sound. When the issue is resolved, the alarm will deactivate automatically. 

#### Defrosting Procedures

For defrosting, the appliance should be switched off and allowed to complete the defrost cycle. The location of frost accumulation should be monitored, and the interior should be cleaned regularly following the defrosting process. 

#### Cleaning Instructions

Turn off the power supply before cleaning. Avoid using harsh chemicals or bleach-based products which could damage surfaces. Regular cleaning should involve thorough maintenance of the interior and exterior surfaces, ensuring components are free from dust and debris.

For any specific issues or technical assistance, users should refer to the operating manual or seek help from customer service. Always remember to follow the safety protocols when handling and cleaning the appliance to prevent accidental injuries.

It seems there are issues with the appliance, indicated by warning tones, flashing lights, or abnormal temperature readings. If you experience these symptoms, check your household lights and make sure everything is functioning properly. If there is frost buildup or if the appliance is too cold, temporarily increase the temperature settings.

For any mechanical malfunctions or breakdowns, please contact AEG Service Force, as these appliances are subject to specific regulations (GSG, VBG, VDE) and EU directives (73/23/EWG, 89/336/EWG, including 92/31/EWG).

If the appliance is malfunctioning, it may be due to improper sealing, obstructed airflow, or issues with recent food placement. Heat is generally dispersed through the rear of the appliance in a closed system design to maintain cooling efficiency.
