**Operating Guide**

This section outlines how to utilize various functions such as loading, rinsing, conditioning, starching, and cleaning the appliance. Additionally, guidelines for troubleshooting and handling emergencies, including child safety precautions and transport instructions, are included.

**Safety Precautions**

Always ensure children are supervised and cannot access the appliance to prevent accidents. Repairs should only be performed by qualified professionals to avoid risks of shock or overheating. Disconnect the appliance during maintenance or cleaning.

**Installation and Use**

The appliance features comply with technical standards. It’s important to ensure the machine is correctly connected to the water supply and to watch for any freezing conditions if located in unheated areas.

**Loading Instructions**

For effective washing, sort items appropriately. Materials like delicate fabrics should be washed separately, and ensure that items such as colored fabrics are washed with similar colors to prevent dye transfer.

**Cycle Selection**

Choose appropriate wash programs based on fabric type. Options include:

- **COTTONS/LINEN**

- **DELICATES**
- **WOOL (Handwash)**

Select features like Pre-wash, Rinse+, or Delay Timer when needed. The machine intelligently adjusts settings based on load type.

**Maintenance and Water Management**

Monitor and adjust water levels as necessary. Follow operation instructions for optimal performance, ensuring the right cycle and load size.

**Software Updates**

If the appliance requires software updates, refer to customer support for guidance. Ensure that components like hoses are properly maintained and disconnected when servicing or relocating the appliance.

By adhering to these instructions, you will ensure efficient usage and longevity of your KO-LAVAMAT appliance.

### DELAY TIMER Instructions

To set the DELAY TIMER, press the DELAY TIMER button and select the desired duration in hours. The START/PAUSE button will illuminate to confirm your selection. If the timer shows the indicated hours and the cycle needs to be adjusted, turning it OFF will disable the operation. To utilize the PRE-WASH option, press the PRE-WASH button, which also activates the DELAY TIMER for the selected duration.

The DOOR/LIGHT button indicates whether the door is securely closed. A red light signals that the door is not locked adequately, which may interrupt operation. Ensure that loads are properly sorted according to fabric type and load size to optimize washing conditions. 

For washing products and additives, such as conditioners and treatment solutions, refer to the specific compartments indicated for use. Be cautious not to exceed the MAX fill lines for pre-wash and main wash compartments.

If the START/PAUSE button flashes while being pressed, ensure the door is fully closed. Incorrect closing may prevent the cycle from starting. 

### Stand-By Functions

The stand-by state engages when the control panel is not actively being used. If the EASY IRON option is chosen, the washing machine will complete the selected cycle effectively and transition to an end phase, indicated by the END light.

At the end of the cycle, the machine may automatically switch to stand-by mode. If selected options are not functioning appropriately, follow the troubleshooting steps outlined in the manual or contact Service Force for assistance.

### Troubleshooting and Maintenance

If the device does not operate as expected, various issues may be at play, including water supply interruptions or software alerts displayed on the control panel. Make sure to inspect connections and settings as illustrated. If troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, it is advisable to contact Service Force.

Cleaning and maintaining the machine is essential. Regularly check and clean all compartments and the exterior with a soft cloth, avoiding abrasive cleaners. 

### Warnings

1. Disconnect the power supply before performing any cleaning or maintenance.
2. Ensure the emptying hose is free from blockages and securely reattached after any maintenance work.
3. If over-dosing occurs, the wash cycle may not complete properly.

By adhering to these guidelines, the operational efficiency and longevity of the washing machine can be ensured.

**Instructions for Hose Connection and Manual Drainage:**

To securely connect the emptying hose, turn it clockwise. If manual drainage is required, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power source first. To initiate the emptying process, turn the dial to the "SHORT SPIN" setting and press the button until the RINSE indicator flashes. During this time, release the button and observe the RINSE indicator as it continues to flash.

**Water Cooling Functionality:**

To activate the water cooling function, rotate the dial to "SHORT SPIN." Press the PRE-WASH button for a few seconds until the MAIN WASH light begins to flash, then release the button. If you wish to check if cooling is active, repeat the process. This functionality can also be designated as "Additional Water Cooling."

**Integrated Features:**

Ensure the machine's display is readily visible. To use the stain removal feature, set the dial to "SHORT SPIN." Press the STAIN button until the END light flashes, then release. If you need to verify the status of the stain removal feature, repeat the aforementioned steps.

**Protection Settings:**

For child protection, press and hold the START/PAUSE and PRE-WASH buttons simultaneously for several seconds. This activates the child lock, preventing any unintended operation during washing.

**Transport Precautions:**

Always transport the appliance with caution by positioning it from the front or the right side. Avoid moving it without proper support, using a trolley if necessary. Ensure both hoses are securely connected to prevent damage.

**Installation Guidelines:**

Place the appliance on a level surface, ensuring it is free from heat sources or moisture. Check the height of the rear foot manually to adjust its length, if needed.

WARNING: This appliance must be earthed. Connection ratings can be found on the rating plate. Use appropriate wiring according to local regulations, ensuring correct attachments for the earth (yellow/green wire), neutral (blue wire), and live connections (brown or red).

**Plumbing Requirements:**

For permanent plumbing, connect the water supply using the supplied hose. Make sure to position the drainage hose correctly to avoid backflow, and maintain an appropriate height for effective drainage.
