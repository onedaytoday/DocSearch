**11B INSTALLING DOOR HANDLES ON STAINLESS STEEL MODELS**

Begin by attaching the protective shoulder (A) at four designated locations. Use a wrench to secure the top screw (B), followed by affixing screw (C). Next, install screws (D and E); ensure that one section of screws is positioned appropriately, and that the other is secured beneath the surface. All screws should be tightened firmly.

**CONNECTING WATER SUPPLY**

Switch off the house water supply and direct the hose to the front of the refrigerator. Turn the water valve off to prevent leaks during installation. 

**TURNING ON THE POWER**

Activate the power switch to the "ON" position. Verify that the lights in the Fresh Food section are functioning. Allow several hours for the appliance to stabilize.

**STARTING THE ICEMAKER**

Ensure that the icemaker switch is set to "ON" for automatic operation. Do not interact with the arm until the unit begins creating ice. If you need to pause the icemaker, switch it to "OFF."

**INSTALLING THE TOE KICK**

Attach the toe kick (shipped taped to the top of the unit) using the screws provided for stability.

**DOOR ALIGNMENT**

Stand back to inspect the alignment of the doors. If they appear uneven due to the weight, adjust the Fresh Food section or the other door as needed, using a wrench as shown. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Ensure that the Fresh Food compartment is aligned slightly higher than the freezer section. Adjustments may be necessary to maintain proper alignment.
