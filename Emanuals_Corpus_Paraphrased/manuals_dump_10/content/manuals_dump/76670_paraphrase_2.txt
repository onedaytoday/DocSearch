RF components include EL D300, J405, J401, J301, J404, J300, BT300, J407, J400, J400 RF EL25, J407 EL25, and H2 100A UD. Additionally, models such as J500 and J406 feature LCD displays. The devices H2 100A UD, J400, and J407 are combined with multiple 3D2 16B units, along with D102 and D153 models. The setup includes various devices like J402, LEDJ200, SPKR, D514, D513, and SW300, incorporating remote options with RFMODKT and RFMODKT3 interfaces. J403, J201, and microphone damage boards are also noted, with optimal wiring using RG-6. The security systems utilize HID units such as CPTK3, CPT3PH, CPTK33, CPT33PH, RFMODKT (MHZ), and RFMODKT3 (MHZ) for unlocking functions in conjunction with J400 and J407. It's crucial to ensure proper screw operations and detection protocols for these security components: CPT1, CPT2, CPT13, CPT23, J400, RF Security, CPT4, and CPT43.
