### IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS
Please adhere to the following safety precautions concerning the appliance. If there are any concerns, refer to the manufacturer. This appliance is heavy; use caution when moving it. Ensure compliance with specifications for power supply connections, and avoid exposing it to high heat. The rear should not be obstructed during installation and should remain clear for proper ventilation. 

Allow the appliance to settle for several hours before use to ensure stability. Ensure compatibility with high-voltage requirements to prevent overheating or potential ignition hazards. Only authorized technicians should undertake any repairs or servicing, especially because improper handling or repairs could lead to serious malfunction. Children should not be allowed to play near or with the appliance to avoid risks of suffocation.

Food should not be placed in the appliance while still hot, and items prone to bursting (like carbonated beverages) should be stored carefully to prevent accidents.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLIANCE
- **Fresh Food Compartment**

## OPERATION
To operate the appliance, familiarize yourself with the thermostat controls. The thermostat light indicates if the compartment temperature is appropriately set (the yellow light at -16°C shows normal operation). Adjust the temperature based on the food's condition and your storage needs.

The red warning light activates if the compartment temperature falls above -12°C, indicating potential spoilage. Fast-freeze options can help preserve food quality; ensure to limit interruption of this setting.

### FRESH FOOD STORAGE
Optimize storage by gradually introducing items. Once food has fully frozen, you can manually switch off the fast-freeze function. Allow adequate space for air circulation around food items. Ensure that all stored items are properly sealed to minimize spoilage and maintain quality.

### DEFROSTING
Frost accumulation should be managed by turning off the appliance when ice build-up exceeds acceptable levels. Remove food items and use layers of newspaper to absorb moisture during defrosting. Re-adjust the thermostat to a working temperature after defrosting is complete.

### MAINTENANCE AND CLEANING
Always disconnect the appliance from electricity before cleaning. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials on any surfaces as they may cause damage or leave lingering odors. Use the appropriate cleaning products for both internal and external surfaces.

### TROUBLESHOOTING
If issues arise with the appliance, ensure it has been installed and used according to guidelines. Conditions such as continuous frost build-up may indicate mechanical failure or improper settings. Check the thermostat and surrounding environment for obstacles and functionality.

**INSTALLATION**  
Position the unit for optimal efficiency, ensuring it’s situated in an environment where temperatures remain below 10°C (50°F) or above 32°C (90°F). Avoid exposure to heat and sunlight, and ensure there is adequate airflow around the back and top of the unit. 

Leave sufficient space above the unit. Alternatively, follow the guidelines for clearances based on the model specifics.  

To install the unit, gently place it on its back, allowing for approximately 3 inches of clearance from the top. Unscrew any components as needed, including the top and feet, ensuring that the hinge is handled carefully. Be cautious when tightening screws to avoid any operational issues.  

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTION**  
WARNING: THIS APPLIANCE MUST BE EARTHED. Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that the power supply is turned off and that the electrical fittings are secure. The connections should be made as follows:

- Use appropriately colored wires:  
  - Earth (E) - typically green/yellow  
  - Neutral (N) - usually blue  
  - Live (L) - often brown or red  

Ensure that any molded plugs comply with BS1362 standards. This appliance meets E.E.C. Directive specifications to minimize interference. 

Keep in mind that proper grounding is essential for safety.
