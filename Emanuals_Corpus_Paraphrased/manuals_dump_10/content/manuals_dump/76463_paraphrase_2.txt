### Applications for Water Heater Cold Water

**Overview:** The system is designed to manage cold water flow and combine it with heating functions. The flow switch is essential for regulating the mix of water, with a specification of GPM determined by the head height and other factors.

**Installation Notes:** Ensure that the installation maintains a temperature differential of 10°F (5°C) below the heater's set point. A relay rated higher than 85W should be employed to prevent any operational issues. This includes integrated shut-off and service mechanisms.

**Safety Features:** The system incorporates safety mechanisms to prevent scalding and backflow, with a focus on operation at higher temperatures. A remote control option is available but comes with warnings regarding possible interference.

**Connection Instructions:**
- Connect the remote cord to the unit by matching the black and white wires to their corresponding connectors.
- Ensure the connections are secure to prevent malfunctions.

**Installation Specifications:**
- Ensure a precise height for each fitting from the bottom of the case to adhere to installation requirements.
- Components include a condensate drain, hot and cold water inlets, gas inlet, and wiring thoroughways for AC120V.

**Additional Information:**
- Wall anchor provisions should be included to secure the installation and prevent exposure to direct sunlight.
- Proper installation height and wire management are crucial for optimal performance.

**Warnings and Cautions:**
- Follow all shutdown instructions carefully to avoid overheating and potential system failure.
