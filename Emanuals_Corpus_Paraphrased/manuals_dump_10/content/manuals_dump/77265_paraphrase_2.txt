### Battery Installation and Remote Control Operation

To install the batteries, use AAA batteries and ensure they are inserted correctly, matching the polarities. If both batteries are low, replace them immediately. Avoid mixing old and new batteries to prevent performance issues in the remote control. If the remote does not function properly, check for obstructions in front of the DVD receiver that may interfere with signal transmission.

### Connecting Devices

Follow the provided instructions to connect the DVD player properly. Use the correct AV cables: connect the red and white cables for audio, and the yellow cable for video. Ensure that all connections are secure to avoid any disruption in sound or visual output.

### Surround Sound Configuration

For optimal surround sound, position the speakers as follows: the front left and right speakers should be directed towards the listening area, and the rear speakers should be positioned to create a surround effect. The subwoofer is best placed close to the main speakers to enhance bass response. Aim for speaker alignment that promotes a balanced sound environment.

### Speaker Connection

To connect the speakers, strip the insulation from the wire ends, secure them in the terminals, and ensure they fit tightly. Proper speaker connection is crucial for sound quality and to prevent any interference.

### Antenna Connection

For FM and AM reception, position the antenna in a location that maximizes signal clarity. Adjust the antenna as needed for optimal reception.

### Power Supply Connection

Make sure to connect the power supply correctly to the AC outlet. Use the power button on the front of the unit to turn it on. If there’s an issue with power, check for electrical interference from other devices.

### Basic Operation

To select the sound source, press the corresponding function button (DVD, TUNER, AUX, etc.) to activate the chosen input. The selected input will be indicated on the display. To adjust the volume, use the controls on the front panel or remote. Pressing the mute button temporarily silences the audio.
