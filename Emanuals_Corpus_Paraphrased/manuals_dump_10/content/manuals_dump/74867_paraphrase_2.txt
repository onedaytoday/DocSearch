### III. Operating Instructions

**General Overview**
This unit features a meat and gas-heated option, which can be combined with either a smooth or a grooved griddle plate. It accommodates GN (Gastronorm) pans. 

**Operation and Igniting the Pilot Burner**
Each burner is controlled separately by a dedicated switch. To ignite the pilot burner, press the ignition button and turn it clockwise for a few seconds. Continue to hold the button to allow the gas to flow, and the pilot light should ignite during this time. If the pilot does not light, repeat the process.

**Igniting the Main Burner**
To ignite the main burner, turn the control knob anti-clockwise from the "off" position to the desired setting, which correlates to the rated thermal output.

**Temperature Selection**
The temperature range is adjustable between 195°F and 570°F (90°C and 300°C), with the option to select the desired intensity from high to low.

**Initial Operation**
Before cooking, preheat the entire griddle surface to a temperature of 320°F (160°C) to ensure optimal cooking conditions.

**Preheating**
Ensure the gas supply is connected correctly prior to initial heating.

**Working Guidelines**
Adjust cooking based on the thickness of the food; thinner items will cook quicker than thicker ones. 

**Switching Off the Grill/Griddle**
To turn off the main burner, rotate the knob clockwise until in the "off" position. Make sure the pilot burner is extinguished as well after cooling.

**Long Shut-Downs**
During extended periods of non-use, turn off the gas supply and disconnect any gas bottles, particularly when temperatures drop below 32°F (0°C).

**Cleaning**
Allow the unit to cool before cleaning. Use a soft cloth and a suitable cleaning product to maintain it. Avoid high-pressure cleaning methods and harsh chemicals that can damage the surface.

**Malfunction**
If the heat is inconsistent or the pilot light fails to ignite, check for potential causes such as a dirty burner, defective thermostat, or gas flow issues. Contact customer service for resolution.

**Storage Space**
Recommended storage areas should remain clear and properly ventilated.
