The system comprises coolers operating at temperatures between -2°C and +8°C, featuring appropriate thickness and optional built-in components. This configuration supports pre-charged cooling mechanisms and requires knowledge of construction and installation practices. The new design enhances performance, utilizing pre-painted polyurethane insulation that is free of CFCs and HCFCs. 

The units have rounded internal corners, facilitating quick assembly and ensuring airtightness, particularly with PVC components for high pressure conditions (up to +43°C) and R404A refrigerant. If necessary, defrosting is achieved with a heated mechanism to minimize downtime and enhance operational efficiency, featuring internal IP54-rated lighting. 

Included features comprise an ON/OFF switch, an internal lighting switch, and a functioning thermostat. The right-hinged door is designed with smooth, rounded cam-lift action hinges, ensuring airtight closure and excellent insulation, which aids in reducing energy consumption and maintaining performance according to HACCP standards. Shelving is available as an accessory.
