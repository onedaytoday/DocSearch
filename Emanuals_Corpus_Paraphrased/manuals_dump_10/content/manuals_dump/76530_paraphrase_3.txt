**Instructions Overview**

**Important Notice:** Please follow these instructions carefully for setup and commissioning. 

**Specifications and Responsibilities:**
1. **Assembly and Commissioning:** 
   - Options: 1-Phase, 3-Phase
   - Rotation Direction: Switch control 
   - Protection: Release and collector information provided
   - Application: Refer to specified tables for height, outlet spacing, and input requirements.

2. **Acoustic Specifications:** 
   - Sound levels rounded according to DIN standards.

3. **Compliance:** 
   - Ensure adherence to provided instructions. Any defective components should be replaced immediately. Repairs must be completed by qualified personnel to prevent malfunction.

**Mounting and Dimensions:**
- Follow the guidelines regarding mounting plate heights, moulding strips, and tenons. 

**Electrical Setup:**
- For 1-Phase connections, ensure the unit is linked to an earthed socket protected by an RCD (Residual Current Device). Voltage: 230V, 16A required.
- For 3-Phase setups, connection must use a 16A CEE type earthed with RCD protection. Voltage: 400V, ensure proper supply section.

**Rotation Direction Setup:**
- Default rotation for three-phase systems is counter-clockwise when viewed from above. Ensure proper wiring of leads including the yellow-green earth cable.

**Safety Features:**
- Built-in protection relay switches off the system in case of overload. For manual operation, the release switch must be correctly connected to the supply.

**Collector and Moulding Applications:**
- Follow safety precautions when using collection systems as they may generate hazardous conditions. 

**Operational Guidelines:**
- Feed materials using pushsticks or pushblocks to avoid direct hand contact. Ensure materials fed are suitable and in good condition to prevent excessive wear or damage to components.

**Maintenance:**
- Clean all components regularly to maintain functionality and ensure safety standards are met. 

**Compliance with UK Regulations:**
- Adhere to the relevant laws affecting operation within the UK, including Safety and Health Regulations. When in doubt, consult a qualified electrician.

**Final Note:**
