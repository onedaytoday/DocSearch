**EM78612 Universal R9 Selection**

The EM78612 features a Universal R9 Selection (0B_1111_1111) that allows users to select which MCU (Microcontroller Unit) is connected to the RC (Root Controller) via USB Application (0B_0000_0000). This setup includes endpoints EP0_W for writing and EP0_R/EP1_R for reading from the RC. The device Firmware automatically communicates these operations to the Universal Device Controller (UDC) in compliance with the Product Specification (V1.0).

Upon receiving a STALL SETUP from the host, this status is automatically cleared. Both reading from and writing to the EP0 FIFO requires the UDC to complete its task first. Successful transmission results in a specified status, which is reset when the activity is completed, and should only occur when USB communication is established.

The firmware handles writing to the FIFO such that if it needs to overwrite existing data, it clears it first. The registers, including RD (USB Application FIFO) and RE (USB Application FIFO), relate to the operations of the EP0 FIFO (0X10), demonstrating the required instruction flow.

The EM78612 supports various configurations for its RF functionalities while handling USB endpoint interactions. It includes TCC (Timer Counter Control) and other state registers to manage I/O interactions.

**EM78612 I/O Control**

IOC5 to IOC8 configurations allow for different operational modes, including specifying pull-up or pull-down resistors for connected devices. The integrated options facilitate the management of device connections, enabling functionalities such as toggling between USB and PS/2 with appropriate settings outlined in the Product Specification (V1.0).

**Global Operation Management**

The handling of commands, state changes, and interrupts via the IOCF (Interrupt Output Change Flag) ensures that the MCU can dynamically respond to commands sent through the USB interface. EM78612 includes a robust architecture that accommodates firmware-free operations, thereby streamlining USB command processing through the built-in UDC.

**Conclusion**

The EM78612 is designed to support flexible I/O management while efficiently interfacing with either USB or PS/2 connections. The firmware functions harmoniously with its internal architecture, allowing seamless transitions and clear condition monitoring, as described in the Product Specification (V1.0).
