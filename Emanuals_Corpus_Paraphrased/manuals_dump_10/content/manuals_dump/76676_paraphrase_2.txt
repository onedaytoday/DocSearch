**Self-Adhesive Rear Installation Instructions | www.elitescreens.com**

To proceed with installation, please refer to the following guidelines. 

**Materials Needed:**
- Microfiber cleaning cloth 
- Scraper 

**Installation Notes:** 
Ensure the surface is clean and free from dust or debris before installation. Avoid touching the projection surface to prevent creases or scratches. It is important to handle the screen carefully to minimize the risk of trapping air bubbles during installation. 

Use a proper glass cleaning solution and apply it thoroughly to achieve a smooth, blemish-free surface. Ensure that surfaces do not stick together before applying, as this may lead to uneven adherence. 

After applying the screen, allow it to settle for several hours for optimal adhesion.
