**Wave-Touch™ Controls Overview**

The Wave-Touch™ interface provides user-friendly access to various display options, including WATER CUBES and CRUSHED ICE. The active display lights up brightly, allowing users to interact by touching any area on the screen. After a few seconds of inactivity, the display will dim, prompting users to press and hold for three seconds to turn the options ON or OFF. An illuminated LED indicates that the appliance is OFF.

The system has specific settings that can be manually activated or automatically triggered, particularly in relation to food preservation and cooling functions. Users can cycle through sound preferences, with tones muting during warning alerts, and restore factory settings by pressing and holding for three seconds.

When the operation mode is active, users may adjust cooling levels, with high modes acknowledged through sound notifications. It is also important to note that the appliance maintains functionality during the Sabbath, with lights and displays deactivated as necessary.

For operational efficiency, it is crucial to ensure a proper water supply, avoiding malfunctions caused by inadequate connections. Users should also flush the supply regularly to maintain hygiene and performance.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**

It’s recommended to clean the appliance carefully, avoiding harsh chemicals, and ensuring any cleaning agents used do not interfere with food items. For shelf adjustments, items should be lifted gently upwards before removal. The smooth-glide and soft-close features enhance usability, especially in high-humidity environments.

Users are encouraged to monitor ice and water supply levels to prevent empty operations and to adjust temperatures according to specific item needs. Regular maintenance ensures optimal performance and extends the life of the unit.

**Perfect TM**

The Perfect TM is designed for food items, whether in the cooler, warmer, or fresh food sections. It features smooth-glide ball-bearing functionality for optimal performance. The appliance can effectively thaw foods over several hours and will automatically switch modes as needed. The temperature settings can be adjusted between 28°F and 42°F, using the On/Off and F/C buttons to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Once a temperature option is selected, it remains active unless the unit is turned off. The three settings provide flexibility for various food products, including meats. When the unit is off, do not use abrasive cleaners, and handle with care while cleaning. It is recommended to wipe the unit with a cloth or use the dishwasher-safe cover.

**Soft Serve**

The Perfect TM can easily accommodate items like soft-serve, enhancing operational efficiency while preventing overcrowding on shelves. Proper organization is key to optimizing airflow and cooling. It’s advisable to store food products in airtight containers to prevent freezer burn.

**Cleaning Maintenance**

Regular maintenance is essential for the Perfect TM to maintain its efficiency. Clean the appliance every few months, ensuring the water filter is replaced as needed, and avoid using harsh cleaners that may damage the finish. 

During operation, expect to hear certain sounds like hissing from the defrost heater or clicking when the cooling cycles on and off; these are normal operational noises.  

**Water Filter Management**

The water filter should be checked and replaced every six months. Ensure that it is properly seated to maintain optimal function. If necessary, the supply should be turned off while performing maintenance. 

**General Care Tips**

To preserve the appearance and performance of the Perfect TM, clean it regularly with a cloth and avoid using abrasive materials. When traveling or during prolonged periods of non-use, it’s best to turn the cooling off and clean thoroughly to prevent buildup. 

In summary, proper usage and maintenance of the Perfect TM will ensure its longevity and efficient operation for a wide variety of food storage needs. For further assistance, refer to the product manual or the manufacturer's website.
