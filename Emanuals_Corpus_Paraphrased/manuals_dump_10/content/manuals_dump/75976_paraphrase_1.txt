### Note
Always prioritize safety and adherence to these guidelines to ensure optimal appliance performance.

### Normal Sounds and Cooling Performance

You may hear various sounds from the appliance while it operates. Normal operational noises include whirring from the cooling fan or sounds from the thermostat. These are typical when the thermostat is adjusting to maintain optimal temperature. Ensure food is stored properly and not overcrowded to allow for even heat circulation, which can be affected by obstructions. If the food is too close to the cooling vents, it may hinder cooling efficiency, resulting in temperature issues.

### Defrosting and Cleaning

Defrosting occurs when frost collects on the evaporator coils, particularly during the cooling cycle. For cleaning, always disconnect the appliance from the electricity supply before proceeding. Use mild cleaning agents, avoiding those with bleach or harsh chemicals, and ensure all surfaces are cleaned thoroughly. Be cautious while cleaning to prevent any damage that can impair cooling efficiency.

### Light Specifications

To ensure safety, switch off the appliance before replacing the light. Apply the appropriate voltage and wattage when selecting a replacement bulb. For assistance, consult AEG Service Force or authorized retailers. To replace the bulb, remove the light cover and unscrew the old bulb.

### Troubleshooting and Service Information

If the appliance is not functioning correctly, check for high frost build-up or if the door is properly sealed. If frost accumulates continuously, the light might indicate an underlying issue. For persistent problems, contact AEG Service Force for professional assistance. Ensure you have your purchase details, including the PNC and serial number, ready for quicker service.
