# Operating and Installation Instructions for Electrolux Refrigerators Type A310 Model RM 123E and Model RM 122F

## Important User Information
It is crucial to keep this instruction manual for future reference. If the refrigerator is sold or transferred to another owner, ensure that this manual is also passed along for guidance on operation and maintenance. 

**Safety Precautions**: Children should not be allowed to play with the refrigerator or its controls. Service should be performed by authorized personnel only. Adhere strictly to the manufacturer's specifications; using the refrigerator outside of these guidelines may compromise its function. Ensure proper clearance as outlined in the instructions to avoid overheating and to maintain optimal food preservation.

**Defrosting Instructions**: When defrosting, do not use sharp tools to remove ice buildup forcibly. Allow ice to thaw naturally as per the guidelines. After installation, allow the refrigerator to stabilize before switching on.

## General Guidance for Plug Fitting
The proper assembly of the plug is essential. Remove the outer sheath or insulation around the conductors carefully while attaching it to the outlet.

## Installation Instructions
### Introduction
Follow these instructions meticulously to ensure the correct installation of your refrigerator, allowing adequate airflow for cooling. Proper spacing as detailed in this manual is essential for efficient operation. 

**Temperature Guidelines**: The refrigerator functions effectively at temperatures up to 32°C (90°F) with cooling efficiency extending to about 35°C (95°F). To avoid overheating, ensure proper clearance around the unit, especially at the back, for ventilation.

### Ventilation and Safety
Ventilation is critical for optimal cooling performance. The design minimizes the risk associated with bottled gas operation. Consult local authorities and guidelines to comply with installation regulations.

### Importance of Leveling
Ensure the refrigerator is level to maintain effective cooling and operational efficiency. An unlevel appliance can affect the performance of components such as the ice tray.

## Changing the Door Hinges
To change the door hinges, gently remove the door and detach the screws from the top and bottom hinge assemblies. Reposition the door as needed and secure it with the screws on the opposite side.

## Changing the Outer Door Panel
If you're changing the outer door panel or matching it with another style, detach the existing panel by removing screws, and replace it with a new panel of compatible thickness and size.

## Refrigerator Dimensions and Building-in
When building in the refrigerator, ensure that there’s adequate circulation space around the unit for cooling efficiency. Recommended dimensions should be followed as indicated in the manual.

## Vent Hole Installation
A vent hole beneath the refrigerator should be created to facilitate heat dissipation and should lead directly to the outside to ensure efficient operation.

## Flue Arrangement
The flue must be correctly installed to promote proper ventilation and cooling function. Follow the provided guidelines for positioning to prevent operational issues.

## Electrical Installation
For models RM 123E and RM 122F, ensure that the electrical supply meets the required specifications (75W, 230V). The refrigerator should be properly grounded in accordance with local electrical standards.

When connecting the refrigerator to the vehicle's 12V supply, ensure that the polarity is observed, connecting '+’ to the positive terminal and ‘-’ to the negative terminal. Use appropriate wiring to maintain safety and compliance with specifications.

By adhering to these guidelines, you will ensure the appropriate installation and functioning of your Electrolux refrigerator.

### Electrical and Gas Supply Instructions

**Electricity Connection**  
The appliance should be connected to a properly earthed 230V electrical supply. The outlet must be accessible and compatible with UK standards. The wire colors are coded as follows:  
- **Green and Yellow** = Earth  
- **Blue** = Neutral  
- **Brown** = Live  

In the UK, ensure the Green and Yellow wires are connected to the earth terminal. The Blue wire connects to the neutral, and the Brown wire connects to the live terminal. **WARNING:** This appliance must be earthed.

If the appliance is intended for 12V operation, ensure that it is fused appropriately when connected to systems in different countries. The 12V supply should be able to handle the appliance's heating needs, and the wiring must be secure to facilitate servicing. 

**Gas Connection**  
Use gas supply lines that are continuously operational, preferably with an incorporated shut-off valve for safety. Supply connections should utilize B.S.P threaded fittings and be securely sealed. When connecting, ensure all safety precautions are taken, and avoid any flame during the process.

### Instructions for Use

**Operational Guidelines**  
For optimal performance, follow the guidelines provided. Improper setup may impair cooling efficiency. Ensure proper airflow from front to back of the unit; any obstruction can lead to overheating.

When using the appliance, it is important to disconnect power to prevent overheating if tilted beyond a certain angle. In case of malfunction or overheating, allow for cooling before restarting.

### Start-Up Process  
To start the refrigerator, ensure the gas bottle is properly connected and operational. Ignite using a lighter or flint only after confirming the gas flow is uninterrupted. Once lit, allow the thermocouple to heat for a few seconds to maintain ignition.

### Emergency Lighting Procedure  
For emergency situations, a 12V supply should use batteries like PP3, PP7, or PP9. Ensure correct polarity when connecting. Always turn off the electric supply before maintaining or servicing the unit.

**Temperature Control**  
Control temperature settings according to the contents and external conditions. Pre-cool the appliance for optimal performance. Adjust the thermostat as necessary based on the volume of items stored and the need for cooling.

### Food Storage  
To maximize space and maintain food safety, use half-depth shelves and keep items covered. Maintain separation of different food types to prevent contamination.

### Ice-Making  
When making ice, fill the tray to one inch from the top and allow for sufficient freezing time before releasing the ice.

**Travel Catch**  
Ensure that the travel catch is securely in place while transporting the appliance to prevent accidental openings.

By adhering to these instructions, you can ensure safe and efficient operation of your appliance.

### DEFROSTING and Ice Tray Maintenance

Regular defrosting of the ice tray is essential for optimal performance, typically once every few weeks. To do this, switch off the refrigerator, remove the ice tray, and allow any frost to melt. Clean the ice tray and the shelf thoroughly before refilling it with fresh water, ensuring the unit is free from any residue or debris.

### CLEANING

Clean the refrigerator as needed when it is turned off. Use a soft cloth and mild detergent for cleaning surfaces. Avoid strong chemicals, abrasives, or heavily scented cleaning agents on any part of the refrigerator. After cleaning, ensure everything is dry before reconnecting power.

### USAGE 

When not in use, disconnect the refrigerator from the 12V power supply, empty it, and clean it thoroughly to prevent issues upon reactivation.

### TROUBLESHOOTING

If the refrigerator fails to operate, consider the following checks:

1. **Follow the "STARTING THE REFRIGERATOR" instructions.**
2. Ensure the bottle is empty as needed.
3. Check the 12V power supply is properly connected and functioning.
4. Verify that the thermostat is not set to 'off.'
5. Inspect for any winter covers that may be obstructing airflow.
6. Ensure doors are closed tightly.
7. If issues persist, have a qualified service technician assess the situation.

### MAINTENANCE

Regularly inspect hoses for cracks and test couplings. If any problems arise, consult a service technician.

### ADDITIONAL TIPS

Ensure the 12V system functions while the vehicle is running to prevent battery drain. Keep the refrigerator clean and organized for optimal performance during operation.

### SERVICE AND SPARE PARTS

For repairs or spare parts, consult your local service center or reference your telephone directory for assistance.
