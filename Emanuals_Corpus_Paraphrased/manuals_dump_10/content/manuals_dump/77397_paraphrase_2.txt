The PFH unit is designed without optional capacities and is available pre-charged with R-407C, featuring a phenolic coating for enhanced protection. It is equipped with various internal components including a crankcase heater, high-pressure switch, and sight glass. The unit supports single-phase and three-phase operation.

#### Installation Considerations
Before installation, inspect the delivery to ensure all components are intact. Ensure the location allows for proper air supply and is at least 5 feet from walls or other obstructions to maintain airflow. The electrical supply must meet the required specifications per Emerson Network guidelines.

#### Maintenance and Troubleshooting
Regular maintenance is essential to ensure optimal performance. A troubleshooting guide is included to assist with common issues. Units are designed for easy access to crucial elements for service and repair.

#### Electrical Specifications
For installation, ensure compliance with local electrical codes. The unit operates at 277V with a typical current draw detailed in the electrical specifications section. Additional multi-phase wiring configurations are provided for different unit capacities.

#### Wiring Diagrams
Wiring diagrams for both single and three-phase configurations are included. These diagrams outline the proper connections for safe and effective operation, following NEC Class standards.

#### Additional Notes
Refer to the tables for recommended applications, sound ratings, and charge requirements at different temperature settings. Various models offer specific operational features tailored to various service needs.

This overview encapsulates the vital features and requirements of the PFH unit, ensuring that users have clear guidance for installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting.

### Considerations

The 3-ton unit comes factory-charged and can be connected without additional equipment. It features insulated suction lines. The 8-ton unit has four insulated suction lines and is pre-charged with R-407C (3.5-ton capacity only). Optional sweat kits are available. 

### Important Notes

Differences should be noted in PFH model numbers, mounting locations, and installation requirements. Refer to the provided table for guidance on mounting configurations, ensuring all local compliance standards are met. R-407C requires special attention due to its hygroscopic properties; care should be taken to prevent exposure to moisture. 

### Installation Guidance

Suction lines should be installed with proper pitch, and any connections must be made using clean techniques. Ensure all fittings are secure, and check the tightness of threaded connections. The table provided specifies the recommended outside diameters (OD) and other necessary details for installation configurations.

For recovery of existing systems using R-22, ensure to follow protocols for transferring refrigerant and inspect installation sites for sufficient clearance. Each new unit should be connected appropriately, considering the recommendations for both R-407C and existing refrigerant types.

### Electrical Setup

Prior to connecting power, confirm compliance with NEC standards and ensure the unit is properly grounded. The operation should only commence once all pre-checks are completed. Pay close attention to supply voltage, especially concerning the crankcase heater and its operation relative to pressure readings.

### Operational Procedures

During operation, monitor the high head pressure and ensure that the crankcase heater is functioning correctly. Set up should include a three-phase rotation check. Should high head pressures trigger operational cutoffs, the unit will follow pre-defined protocols before restarting. 

### Conclusion

Follow the detailed guidelines for charging, installation, and maintenance to ensure the longevity and efficiency of the installed units, and adhere to all relevant safety and regulatory standards throughout the process.

The implementation of a suction bypass is more advantageous than relying solely on suction due to the potential for overheating. When the system is operating at elevated suction levels, overheating can occur, particularly when closures are engaged. If the suction level drops below a certain threshold, the system's flow may revert back to suction. Increased superheat is associated with this condition, permitting three specific operational modes and enhancing overall performance. Superheat sensors must be strategically positioned downstream, with targets set at higher superheat levels (50-60°F or 10-15°C) for optimal operation. 

Regular maintenance involves accessing the housing for cleaning, which may be performed with suitable cleaners. Caution should be exercised by turning off the power switch before isolation to ensure safety. If any overheating issues arise, it is essential to address them promptly to prevent insulation burns and equipment failure. Warranty terms may be affected by cleaning procedures and any potential mechanical failures indicated.

In the event of a burnout, procedures should follow guidelines established by Emerson. Equipment should be returned to the factory for assessment, with credit issued where relevant. When charging the system, it is important to follow proper recovery procedures and guidelines, ensuring all components are isolated as necessary.

Charging the system should be done cautiously, checking the sight glass for accurate levels and avoiding excessive release of refrigerants into the atmosphere. Special attention should also be given to temperature thresholds and conditions affecting the sight glass reading. Each receiver system should be inspected for charge consistency, and proper assembly should be maintained.

In troubleshooting scenarios, various factors like phase rotation, superheat levels, and mechanical component performance may be analyzed to determine the cause of issues. Compliance with operational guidelines is crucial in high-stakes applications, especially for Emerson Network's business-critical technology solutions, which guarantee continuity in demanding environments.
