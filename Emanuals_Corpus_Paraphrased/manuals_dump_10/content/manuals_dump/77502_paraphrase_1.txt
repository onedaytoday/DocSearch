**Clock Functionality**
Users can manually adjust the clock using specific buttons to set the time or navigate through options. To manually set the time, hold the designated buttons until the display shows the current setting. If interrupted, the clock will revert to its previous state. The buttons are also used for setting alarms (ALM). While adjusting, the AM/PM indicator will flash; ensure it is set correctly before finalizing.

**Alarm Selection**
The clock provides three alarm settings, accessible through the ALM button. When the alarm is activated, it can be turned on or off using the appropriate buttons. To navigate through alarm modes, hold the ALARM MODE button and follow any prompts. Any changes made can be overridden by repeating the process with the ALM buttons.

**FM/AM Tuner Operation**
To operate the FM/AM tuner, press the POWER ON/OFF switch located at the top. Tuning between stations can be done using dedicated buttons to cycle through frequencies. When tuning, the display will show the selected station. If the tuning is interrupted, press the corresponding buttons to recover the previous station.

**Memory Function for Stations**
The device can store up to 10 FM and 10 AM stations for easy access. To save a station, press the MEMORY button while the desired frequency is displayed, followed by the PRESET button. This will assign the station to memory. To switch between AM and FM modes, use the AM/FM button.

**Compact Disc Functionality**
The device supports standard CDs, including CD-R and CD-RW formats, but playback may vary based on the disc type and recording software. To start CD playback, press the POWER ON/OFF button. If the device was switched off before, the last used track will continue from where it left off. The PLAY/PAUSE button allows for temporary playback halts.

**Playback Controls**
For playback control, the OPEN/CLOSE button is used to insert or eject the CD. If playback needs to be paused, use the PLAY/PAUSE button. To skip tracks, press the SKIP/SEARCH buttons; this offers fast navigation through the CD. High-speed search is available by holding these buttons.

**Repeat Playback Option**
To repeat a specific track, press the REPEAT button after selecting it. The REP indicator will signal that the track is set to repeat continuously. For multiple tracks, activate the REPEAT function, and it will enable continuous playback.

**Programming Tracks for Playback**
Programming tracks allows for customized playback order. Press the PROGRAM button and follow the prompts to select tracks. Once set, press PLAY/PAUSE to initiate playback.

**Sleep Timer**
The sleep function allows the user to set a timer for the device to automatically shut off after a specified duration. This can be adjusted using the SLEEP button, which allows selection of different time intervals.

**Snooze Feature**

The built-in lithium battery will eventually require replacement, depending on factors like usage and household conditions.

Disconnect from AC before replacing to maintain memory. 

**Clock Memory**: If the lithium battery is depleted, it may trigger a flashing warning. The clock will reset upon AC power interruption. To restore the clock, use a new lithium battery. Follow the instructions to adjust the MONTH/DATE and TIME by pressing the corresponding buttons simultaneously, releasing them only after setting the necessary adjustments.

**CARE AND MAINTENANCE**: To maintain the unit’s appearance, clean with a soft, lint-free cloth. Avoid the use of abrasive materials or cleaners; if needed, utilize CD cleaning solutions.
