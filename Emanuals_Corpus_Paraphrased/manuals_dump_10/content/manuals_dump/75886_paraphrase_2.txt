**Lighting and Temperature Control:** 

The lighting in the unit should remain continuously illuminated. If food is exposed to frost or is too cold, this could indicate a problem. Water may contain symptoms that suggest an issue with the food's temperature within a few hours. To address this, adjust the thermostat to a warmer setting temporarily. Refer to the "Light" section and the "Initial" section for further guidance. 

**Warning:** Ensure the light switch is turned off, or disconnect the supply if necessary. To deactivate the light, adjust the thermostat accordingly, then remove the light cover and the screw. Follow the instructions for pressing the light mechanism gently to ensure it operates correctly. 

**Regulatory Compliance:** This device complies with various household legislation, including safety and electromagnetic compatibility regulations (GSG, VBG, VDE) and EU directives (73/23/EWG, 89/336/EWG, including 92/31/EWG).

**Technical Specifications:** The cooling system effectively transfers heat from the food to the surroundings, ensuring proper cooling. The unit is designed for optimal performance, with built-in components strategically positioned at the rear. This design helps in efficiently dissipating heat released during operation to the surrounding environment.
