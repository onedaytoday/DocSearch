**Disclaimer**  
This document serves as a guideline. All installations and operations should comply with the manufacturer's specifications and relevant regulation standards.

**Technical Paraphrase:**

**A. Earth Continuity Check**  
1. Connect the equipment to check for earth continuity. The reading should indicate a failure if the results are NO, NO, YES, NO. If this occurs, remediate immediately.  
   
**B. Insulation Check**  
- Ensure the appliance is electrically disconnected before conducting the insulation check. Switches should be in the ON position. Measure from the leads connected to earth. If the reading shows values other than infinity, further investigation is required. Disconnect and check each component to identify any faults. Look for signs of burning or arcing during inspection, particularly around the socket and fuse.  

**C. Polarity and Earth Check**  
- Verify that wiring connections for "N," "L," and earth are installed correctly. Ensure that the terminals maintain proper insulation and polarity through the HT leads.  

**Commissioning Procedure**  
1. Adjust the settings to maximum, then to minimum, and back from minimum to maximum. If the indicator remains extinguished, follow the troubleshooting steps outlined.  
2. Use a thin screwdriver to adjust the ignition system's settings. Monitor the light indicators: if the light remains stable and extinguishes upon reaching maximum, the adjustment is successful.  
3. Conduct tests on the injector system by turning the power supply on and observing the readings. 

**Conversion to LPG**  
- When converting from a different gas type to LPG, ensure that all injectors are correctly set, and the supply is marked in the 'OFF' position. Adjust injectors as necessary and secure them with a thin screwdriver to meet the specified rating.
