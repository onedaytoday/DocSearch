### Mechanical Flow Section - March: Safety and Assembly Guidelines

#### Surface Temperature Hazard
Be aware of potential hazards due to high or low surface temperatures. Always wear protective gear when working with equipment that may reach these extremes.

#### Cutting Hazard
Handle sharp objects with care. Use protective equipment to avoid serious injuries when dealing with sharp edges.

#### Transportation Hazard
Caution is required during the transportation of components. The bore may become obstructed or present tripping hazards; ensure pathways are clear before moving equipment.

#### Crushing Hazard
Avoid placing hands or limbs near moving parts to prevent serious injuries. 

#### Escaping Fluids Hazard
The purchaser is responsible for selecting compatible components. Ensure all connections are secure to prevent leaks. If fluids escape from the housing, take immediate action to mitigate serious issues.

#### Fluid Pressure Hazard
Contents within housings may be under pressure. Do not attempt to release pressure carelessly, as this can result in serious injuries.

#### Assembly Information
All flow components are pre-assembled and tested at the factory. There are multiple mounting options available, including direct and remote mounts, with various configurations such as explosion-proof and intrinsically-safe setups.

#### Operating Guidelines
When operating flow systems, ensure correct orientations are followed. Incorrect installation can lead to malfunctions. Reference the API MPMS and other guidelines for permissible configurations.

#### Safety Precautions
All personnel must follow the safety instructions provided and receive proper training. This includes adhering to rated specifications to prevent damage and ensure safe operation.

#### Hoisting and Rigging
Utilize appropriate hoisting methods in accordance with DOE-STD-1090-2004 standards. Ensure all equipment is rated for the task at hand.

#### Inspection Procedures
Regularly inspect all components. If there is any sign of shock damage, conduct thorough inspections or replace them as necessary.

**Note:** Use only the specified thread ratings for fasteners. Consult the provided references for purchasing and thread rating information relevant to your setup.

#### Temperature Considerations
When mounting heated or cooled components, ensure that they operate within specified temperature ranges. Be mindful of potential hazards related to extreme temperatures. Always use appropriate protective gear.

### Flow Section Overview

**TTL Collector Conductors**  
When using TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic), selected conductors must connect properly to ensure effective input. Inputs must be monitored, and grounding characteristics adhere to specific AWG standards to maintain low resistance (measured in Ohms/ft) across the system. The system should pull input signals properly and manage higher voltages efficiently.

**Grounding Requirements**  
The grounding housing must be internally grounded and connected to the chassis ground for stable operations. Secondary grounding should also link to the chassis ground to ensure safety and compliance with regulations.

**Safety Precautions**  
It is imperative to follow safety protocols when working with hazardous voltage. Serious injury or death could arise from improper handling, particularly in explosive environments. Always ensure that power is disconnected before working in the field and complete necessary checks and applications as per specifications to maintain safety.

**Communication Protocols**  
The system supports TCP/IP for communication instead of traditional ASCII or RTU formats. Communication interfaces include RS-485 and RS-232. HART compatibility allows for integration with field devices and software, facilitating the transfer of essential data through the system's architecture.

**CPU and LED Management**  
The CPU's functionality is indicated by an LED, and a protection switch prevents accidental overwriting of firmware. The system includes Ethernet connectivity and supports various protocols like TCP/IP, ensuring secure data transfer and system management.

**Configuration and Connectivity**  
The IP configuration can be set to DHCP for automatic assignment. Ethernet should be configured for both network safety and access control while providing direct communication to the CPU. The system can detect and switch between RS-232 and RS-485 links automatically, allowing for flexible integration depending on the setup.

**I/O Connections**  
The I/O interface includes multiple ports to connect different outputs based on operational requirements. Each output can be configured to provide specific flow data, direction, and functionality. The system can manage both corrected and uncorrected flow readings, aiding proper monitoring and control.

**Isolation and Security**  
Outputs are designed with opto-isolation from the CPU, ensuring at least 500V isolation for safety. Each connection must be securely grounded to prevent electrical interference and faults. 

**Input Management**  
Inputs are designed to be isolated and configured for various services, including HART functionality. The firmware protects critical operations and safeguards against unauthorized access. 

By adhering to all outlined specifications and safeguards, the system can operate efficiently and safely, ensuring optimal performance in various environments.
