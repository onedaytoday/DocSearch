### XDR Precision Cooling: Ensuring Business Continuity

**IMPORTANT SAFETY GUIDELINES:**  
**SAVE THESE INSTRUCTIONS**

**WARNING**: The unit is top-heavy, which may lead to injury or death if not handled according to these instructions during setup or operation.

**WARNING**: High-pressure risks are present. Failure to follow specified guidelines for installation and servicing could result in serious injury or death. Always isolate the service before handling components.

**CAUTION**: Only personnel who are properly trained and equipped with appropriate headgear should proceed with installation or servicing. Ensure that all components are accurately installed to prevent injury or property damage.

**NOTICE**: Ensure that overhead clearances are measured and maintained to avoid interference with operation.

### PRODUCT OVERVIEW

The XDR cooling unit provides high-density heat management and is typically mounted at the rear of a 42U enclosure. This system is designed to effectively manage heat transfer through the front of your setup, facilitating optimal cooling conditions.

**Mechanical Considerations**: The mounting should support the weight of the XDR appropriately while maintaining proper airflow pathways to enhance cooling efficiency.

### INSTALLATION GUIDELINES

1. **Preparing for Installation**: Ensure that the installation area is well-insulated and free of obstructions. Use appropriate tools and follow all safety protocols during setup.

2. **Connecting Methods**: Installation can involve hard-piped or pre-charged one-shot couplings. Follow best practices for leak-checking and evacuation.

3. **Mounting**: Use M6 screws to secure the XDR unit to the rack. Ensure that it is tightly fastened to prevent any risk during operation.

### MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION

Before operating, verify that the system is correctly assembled and that all components conform to specified standards. Perform regular checks to ensure optimal performance.

### IMPORTANT NOTES

- Always ensure that any XDR system components are properly sealed and secured post-installation.
- Continuous monitoring of the XDR’s functionality is recommended to maintain optimal heat management.

By adhering strictly to these guidelines, you can ensure that your XDR cooling system operates safely and efficiently, facilitating ongoing business continuity.

### Paraphrased Text

The piping for the XDR should connect to designated locations for the XDP and XDC. It is essential to comply with standards for fluorinated refrigerants like R407C and R410A, adhering to relevant European regulations. The system is designed for recovery and servicing while ensuring efficient operation with these refrigerants. If the XDR system or cooling components are linked to an XDP or XDC, they must be properly interlaced. Typically, the XDR features non-interlaced piping. 

### Specifications and Dimensions
Typical XDR diagrams are not to scale, and installation details include connection points for the XDR and XDP, following ASTM standards. The XDR incorporates hard-piped connections with a low-pressure holding charge and optional one-shot couplings to enhance installation ease and reduce the risk of oxidation.

### Charge Management
The XDR and associated equipment, such as the XD, come with a pre-charged option designed for efficient operation and reduced oxidation risk. Guidelines for testing, installation, and use follow best practices from ASHRAE. Recommendations include specifications for branch ODs and IDs to ensure compatibility.

### Leak Checking and Service Procedures
Leak-checking procedures and stability during installation and assembly are critical. Should service or retrofitting be necessary, follow the outlined instructions closely. Use appropriate wrenches and maintain cleanliness to prevent debris from affecting the threads during connection.

### Connection Methods
For connecting the XDR to the XD using one-shot couplings, ensure tools are suitable and maintain a mindful approach to avoid over-tightening. If a pre-charged option is selected, verify connections and allow assembly under proper conditions to prevent charge leakage.

### General Assembly and Maintenance
During maintenance, maintain a focus on safety and correct procedures. Confirm that all couplings are appropriately tightened and inspect for serviceability and potential restrictions. Avoid any rotations that might compromise connections.

**Disconnecting the XD from the XDR**

To safely disconnect the XD from the XDR, follow these steps carefully. First, use a wrench to detach the XD, ensuring you turn it by the specified inches. Next, connect the XD using one-shot couplings while ensuring that no couplings are obstructed. To remove the XD coupling, use a wrench to make sure it is done safely. It’s crucial to properly train personnel and follow the given instructions to avoid any accidents or injuries. Once disconnected, each XD module must be independently secured, ensuring safe handling.

**Installation Checklist and System Verification for Startup**

Before starting up the system, confirm that the XDR is securely attached and complies with all connection specifications. Ensure that the isolation for each XDR, XD, XDP, or XDC is properly connected to the header assembly. Refer to the product specifications for charging instructions and verify that they align with the required standards. Ensure that insulation and connections are fully secure prior to operation.

**Starting the Liebert XD System**

For startup, ensure that the correctly selected model, whether XDP SL-16644 or XDC SL-16671, is utilized. The user should refer to the documentation available at www.liebert.com to begin operations with the XD.

**Maintenance Guidelines for XDR Operation**

Regular maintenance of the XDR is essential for optimal operation. Cleaning should focus on cooling fins and ensuring the cooling system is functioning efficiently. Any fluorinated cooling agents must comply with regulations, such as R407C and R410A, to meet environmental standards.

**Specifications Overview for XDR Models**

Refer to the technical specifications table for various XDR models, including cooling capacities, height, and configurations. Ensure all parts are properly labeled and assembled according to the designated part numbers for efficiency.
