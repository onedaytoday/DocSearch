For repairs, it is advisable to seek professional help if you lack experience, as improper handling can lead to severe issues.

Ensure that all components, like screws and hoses, are intact and securely installed. If you are in a frost-prone area, consult the relevant section regarding installation to prevent damage.

When cleaning the unit, refrain from washing components that aren’t designed for it. Always keep cleaning products and tools out of reach of children to avoid accidental suffocation risks.

When selecting options on the controls, you may notice a sequence of sounds, which will halt after approximately 10 seconds if inactive. The child lock function is automatically activated to prevent unintended modifications.

The available cycles include Prewash, Synthetics, and Wool, which can be adjusted using the control dial. 

**Operational Guidelines:**
- To select your preferred setting, turn the dial clockwise or counterclockwise.
- For additional options (e.g., Night Mode), repeatedly press the relevant button until the desired setting illuminates.

**Notifications and Timer:**
The operational timer will display remaining time for cycles, flashing briefly at the end, while alerts will activate for malfunctioning or incorrect settings. 

You can modify options before starting the washes by selecting the desired cycle and confirming within the time frame.

The hose is equipped with threading for connection. It has been lengthened. If it becomes excessively long, there is a need to procure a hose specifically designed for this application. The hose must be adequately connected to the water supply for proper operation. If there are any issues, it should be addressed directly with the relevant authorities. For optimal functioning, the hose should be securely installed as part of a permanent plumbing system.

Firstly, the hose must be securely fitted to an internal water supply. It’s important to ensure that water flows correctly from the hose to the outlet. If the hose is blocked or damaged, it can affect the operation of connected appliances like dishwashers, which should be linked to a fouling treatment system. If you have any further questions, it is best to consult with the appropriate authorities.

It is crucial that the electrical supply is switched off while performing any maintenance. Ensure that the installation complies with the provided ratings, as mentioned on the rating plate. Proper wiring procedures must be followed: the earth wire should be connected to the designated terminal, the neutral (N) to the appropriate terminal, and the live wire (L) to the corresponding terminal.

Warnings should be observed to avoid any risk of electrical shock. If any parts need replacement, allow a qualified service technician to handle the electrical supply connections. This device should only be handled by professionals authorized to operate in your country. Take care of the environment and recycle responsibly.

In most cases, dishes can be cleaned without pre-washing. Load the dishes into the machine as instructed; the cleaning cycle will commence automatically.

In case of defective workmanship or appearance issues within the warranty period, the service will be provided free of charge according to the specified instructions. Ensure that any repairs are conducted by authorized Service Force technicians, as unauthorized service may void warranties or lead to charges.
