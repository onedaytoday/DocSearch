**AM Black Detergent and Additives**

For optimal results when washing clothes and household textiles, it’s important to use the correct detergents and additives tailored to the specific needs of your laundry. Use non-biological detergents like Fairy for whites and colored items, while ensuring that bleach is avoided for delicate fabrics. For heavily stained garments, consider using stain removers such as Vanish In-Wash. You can choose between traditional powders and liquid detergents, applying them according to the measurements indicated on the packaging. Make sure to follow the instructions provided on the back of compact powders or liquids.

Fabric conditioners enhance the feel of your clothes and can be used in conjunction with your washing machine both for easy-care items and regular loads. Be cautious, as certain fabrics, particularly synthetics, can be flammable. 

**Drying Instructions**

Selecting the appropriate drying settings is crucial based on the type of laundry. Refer to the provided chart for guidance on drying durations based on the material and load type. For items like towels, check if a specific drying cycle is recommended, and utilize the START/PAUSE feature if needed to ensure items are fully dried and distributed evenly during the cycle. 

**Additional Cleaning Tips**

Regular maintenance, such as cleaning detergent compartments and hoses, is vital to prevent clogs and ensure efficient operation. If issues arise, follow troubleshooting steps carefully, noting error codes and their meanings. Contact support if problems persist.

For further assistance, consult the cleaning and care instructions specific to your washer model, ensuring that all elements, such as hoses and filters, are appropriately managed to maintain long-lasting performance.
