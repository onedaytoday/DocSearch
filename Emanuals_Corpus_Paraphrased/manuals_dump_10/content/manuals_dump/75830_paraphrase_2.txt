This version maintains the technical essence while clarifying the information and format.

The food is positioned too high. Water accumulates on the plate, and when it flows, it can reach the ground. Additionally, there may be frost present, and the appliance is not sealed properly. This could lead to issues with food preservation, particularly if the food is packed incorrectly or stacked too closely. 

To address these problems, ensure that the appliance is appropriately closed and the frost is managed. If clogging occurs, clean the drainage outlet to maintain proper airflow. It's crucial for food to be wrapped correctly to prevent contamination.

For optimal performance, the appliance should be situated in a location that adheres to the guidelines specified in the technical rating plate. This promotes efficient operation and airflow. The operational temperature ranges vary by model: SN: +10°C to +32°C, ST: +16°C to +38°C. Ensure the unit is positioned correctly to facilitate air circulation, ideally below the rated height mentioned on the plate.

If any adjustments or repairs are needed, ensure the appliance is earthed properly and refer to the relevant E.E.C. directives for guidance. When making modifications, such as adjusting shelves, follow the provided instructions carefully.

Finally, this appliance is designed for household use only; proper recycling methods must be followed to adhere to environmental regulations. For more information regarding service or recycling, consult the website at www.electrolux.com.
