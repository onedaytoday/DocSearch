**WARNING:** Always turn off electrical service before starting any installation. This is critical to avoid the risk of serious injury or property damage. 

**Usage Guidelines**

This unit is intended solely for general ventilation. Do not use it to exhaust hazardous or explosive materials. To minimize the risk of fire or electric shock, adhere to the following precautions:

1. Ensure the power is off before servicing or cleaning. If the circuit can be locked out, do so securely.
2. Work only with qualified personnel, especially in fire-rated constructions.
3. Follow all local codes and industry standards, such as those from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and ASHRAE.
4. If applicable, ductwork should be installed correctly to mitigate fire risks.
5. Use only metal ductwork for installation. 

**Safety Measures**

To reduce fire hazards:

- Always monitor cooking, especially at high heat, and clean frequently to prevent grease buildup.
- In the event of a grease fire, smother flames with a suitable cover, turn off the heat source, and evacuate the area immediately. Never attempt to move a flaming pan—call the fire department instead.
  
**Installation Specifications**

Ensure that installation meets the relevant ANSI/NFPA and CSA standards. The unit should be connected to a properly grounded circuit. For ductwork, aim for the most direct and efficient route to the exhaust location.

**Additional Notes**

- Use the provided assembly template and components, including screws and anchors, for a secure installation.
- Cold weather installations should be adjusted to accommodate thermal loss.

For more information or specific installation inquiries, please consult with a qualified technician. 

**Final Remarks**

Read and retain these instructions for future reference. Follow all safety precautions to ensure correct and safe operation.

**Mounting Instructions for the Cover**

To mount the cover, align it at the back. Ensure that the top of the cover is positioned correctly as per the included template. Mark the screw locations for the installation process. It's essential to use wall anchors where necessary, ensuring you drill enough to allow the anchors to expand properly.

If ductwork is involved, ensure it aligns straight with the designated outlet from the back to the wall ducting. Measure from the top of the house location to the appropriate height, maintaining a distance of at least 4-7/8" from the indicated screw locations.

**Important Note:** Be cautious with power tools during installation to avoid accidental injury or damage. Ensure that the screws are securely fastened and that their heads are not obstructed by grease or dirt during installation.

**Connecting the Ductwork**

Follow the provided diagrams to connect the ductwork, ensuring a tight seal. Secure the assembly using the included screws, and measure distances as necessary to confirm accurate installation. If removal is needed, uninstall by taking out the assembly screws methodically.

**Electrical Grounding Instructions**

This appliance is equipped with a junction box. The green/yellow wire is essential for grounding—connect this to your home’s electrical grounding system without cutting or removing it to prevent electrical shock hazards.

**Operating the Appliance**

Before switching the appliance on, ensure the internal ON/OFF switch is set correctly. Use designated buttons to control the blower and light functions. Confirm the button operations correspond to the light status, ensuring the light can be turned on or off as required.

**Clock Functions**

The clock functionality displays time and is adjustable using the provided buttons. It can show time down to seconds, allowing for precise tracking. Reset or modify the clock as necessary based on user preferences, ensuring that accurate timekeeping is maintained.

Turn the blower on for effective kitchen ventilation during cooking, adjusting as necessary to manage heat and grease. Keeping the blower consistently operational reduces the buildup of unwanted residues during food preparation. Regular maintenance and cleaning are essential for optimal performance.
