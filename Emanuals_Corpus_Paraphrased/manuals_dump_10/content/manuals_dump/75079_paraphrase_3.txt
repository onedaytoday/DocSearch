The following is a more technical paraphrase of the provided text, maintaining the original meaning:

The cooking process utilizes a heating function that preheats the oven, typically reaching temperatures suitable for cooking. This preheating stage is crucial for achieving optimal cooking results, and it may be necessary to reduce the recommended cooking temperatures by approximately 20-25°C (36-45°F). The positioning of the heating elements within the oven allows for multiple batches of food to be cooked efficiently.

To operate, adjust the function and thermostat. The indicator light will illuminate when the set temperature is achieved, then cycle on and off during the cooking and cooling phases. It is essential to allow the oven to cool down after cooking is complete.

Note that the cooling process is essential to maintain temperature stability. Food items, such as cakes, should be arranged at appropriate distances on the shelves to ensure even cooking. When preparing certain dishes, the positioning of the shelves should allow for adequate airflow.

This oven can cook various foods, including those that require no prior thawing. When roasting, maintain recommended temperatures to avoid excessive browning. Use the cooking chart provided for specific dish types like cakes, bread, and meats, all of which have designated preheating instructions.

Ensure thorough cooking by monitoring the internal temperature with a thermometer, particularly for meats, to prevent undercooking. Follow the directed thickness and quantity specifications as per the cooking chart.

Cleaning should be performed regularly, involving switching off power and using appropriate cleaning products that do not damage surfaces. Chemical cleaners with bleach should be avoided. Regular maintenance includes cleaning interior surfaces, shelf supports, and ensuring the catalytic system remains operational.

For replacing parts like light bulbs, ensure you adhere to specified wattage and types. If issues arise, such as inconsistent cooking or malfunctioning indicators, verify that the electrical connections are secure and that the unit has been adequately set up according to the guidelines.

Safety precautions include ensuring proper earth connections for the oven and adhering to installation specifications to prevent overheating and related hazards. Building installations need to withstand temperature increases and should comply with local regulations.

Overall, users must familiarize themselves with the operating instructions and technical specifications to ensure optimal performance and safety of the cooking appliance.
