### Instructions for the Cooker

#### Introduction

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for using the cooker in accordance with the British C.E. Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It is essential to read and understand these instructions thoroughly before operating the cooker. The cooker is designed for cooking food effectively. Please refer to the installation instructions if the appliance has been fitted. If your cooker came with a set of instructions, ensure they are included for reference.

#### Rating Plate Location

The rating plate can typically be found on the front of the appliance or in the top cavity. Alternatively, it may be located on the back or the top of the unit. Please refer to the rating plate for specific details about your appliance.

#### Lighting the Hotplate

To light the hotplate, set the control to the highest setting and press the igniter. Release it once the flame is established. **Warning**: Should the flame extinguish, do not attempt to reignite immediately; allow the gas to dissipate to avoid a potential flare-up. Ensure the hotplate is safely turned off when not in use.

#### Cooking Indicators

Adjust the heat setting on the hotplate by turning the knob counterclockwise from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then to 'LOW'. This adjustment is crucial for different types of food, such as cooking rapidly or simmering.

#### Safe Cooking Practices

When using the hotplate, keep a close eye on the temperature settings to prevent burns. It's advisable to avoid using the high setting for longer than necessary and to monitor the progress of food as it cooks. Supervise young children around the appliance to prevent accidents.

#### Food Placement and Preheating

When placing food in the cooker, arrange items according to their size and thickness to ensure they cook evenly. Preheat the cooker as required, especially for items like Yorkshire pudding or yeast-based dishes. 

#### Cooking Times and Temperature Management

Follow the provided cooking charts for recommended cooking times and temperature settings. Ensure heat can circulate freely around the food by not overloading the shelves. This facilitates better cooking performance.

#### Roasting Guidelines

When roasting, avoid covering the meat, as this can impede heat circulation, prolong cooking times, and prevent proper browning. Monitor the food closely to ensure it doesn’t overcook or dry out.

#### Cooking Chart Reference

Refer to the cooking chart for guidance on timing and temperature for various dishes such as:

- **Roasting Meat**: Ensure thorough thawing and appropriate cooking times, allowing for stuffing if applicable.
- **Cooked Dishes**: For items like mince or pastries, ensure proper placement on the shelves for even cooking.

#### Final Notes 

When cooking tougher cuts of meat, adjust temperature settings to allow for adequate cooking time. Always use a meat thermometer to verify that internal temperatures reach a safe level. Thoroughly thaw all items before cooking to avoid uneven temperatures.

By adhering to these guidelines and instructions, optimal results can be achieved from your cooker.

### Cooking and Cleaning Instructions

To prepare soups, start by placing the ingredients on the hotplate. Cook until heated thoroughly. If using beans or meat, ensure they are cooked tightly, then reduce the heat and allow them to simmer. For thickening purposes, consider using cornflour, which can prevent curdling. Always ensure food is completely thawed before reheating. Food should only be reheated once, preferably using either the hotplate or microwave.

### Cleaning Protocol

Maintain cleanliness to prevent fire hazards and ensure efficient operation. Utilize only recommended cleaners, and avoid using polishes or cleaners that may dull brass finishes. For the hotplate, clean the surface with appropriate materials. If the cooking surface shows signs of burning or residue, clean it promptly. For crowns, ensure they’re free from debris and cleaned regularly.

### General Maintenance

To avoid tarnishing, regularly clean around kitchen appliances. Clean the top shelf as required, and always follow instructions for maintaining finishes. If any parts become chipped or scratched, consult Service Force for repairs, ensuring compliance with current safety regulations. 

### Positioning and Safety

Ensure the appliance is securely positioned and that no flammable items are nearby. Follow all installation instructions regarding electrical connections, ensuring they comply with BS safety regulations. 

### Servicing Information

For servicing or further assistance, contact Service Force via the provided contact details. This includes support for breakdowns or maintenance concerns. 

### Technical Specifications

- **Dimensions**: Check the height and clearance of the hotplate as indicated.
- **Electrical Connections**: Ensure the appliance is connected to a suitable power source (230V-240V) as specified.
- **Safety Compliance**: Adhere to British Standards for ventilation and combustion product management to minimize hazards.

### Important Notes

Always follow the specified cleaning and cooking protocols to ensure optimal performance and safety. In the event of issues, consult the detailed guidelines or reach out for professional support.

**APPLIANCE LOCATION**  
This appliance should be positioned away from bathroom fixtures, such as showers, and must have sufficient clearance as indicated below. The hotplate must not be installed lower than the specified height. For conditions involving L.P.G. (liquefied petroleum gas), installation must not be below ground level or aboard a boat.

**INSTALLATION PARTS REQUIRED**  
The hotplate must be leveled. Adjustments can be made by rotating the leveling screws either clockwise or counterclockwise, ensuring the appliance is correctly positioned in relation to surrounding shelves.

**STABILITY BRACKET INSTALLATION**  
It is advisable to install the stability bracket (part SK.4729.A) as per the provided instructions to ensure the safety and stability of the appliance. Positioning for the bracket is specified with reference points labeled 'A' and 'B,' and specific heights should be maintained as indicated.

**GAS CONNECTION**  
The gas line connection should comply with the specified standards, with only liquid sealants allowed for use. Avoid P.T.F.E. sealant tape. Ensure the flexible tubing meets BS regulations, marking its compatibility with L.P.G., including a red stripe, band, or label.

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTION WARNING**  
This appliance must be properly earthed and should not be grounded using gas supply piping. An appropriate 230V-240V A.C. supply should be connected. In case the molded plug is cut, proper disposal is necessary to prevent electrical hazards. Ensure that exterior wiring follows I.E.E. regulatory standards. Correct wiring color codes must be adhered to: BROWN to L, BLUE to N, and GREEN/YELLOW to E (earth).

**PRESSURE TESTING**  
Conduct pressure tests on the appliance, including checks for F.S.D. (Flame Safety Device) operation, integrity of the gas supply, and functionality upon reassembly. The hotplate, grill, and oven systems should be inspected for proper seating and ignition.

**OVEN CHECKS**  
Ensure both the main and second oven thermostats are functioning correctly, observing any safety devices such as F.S.D. during operation. Ensure the light operates appropriately.

**GENERAL NOTICES**  
Users should familiarize themselves with the appliance, including controls and operation guidelines. Service Force should be contacted for any service-related inquiries or needs.
