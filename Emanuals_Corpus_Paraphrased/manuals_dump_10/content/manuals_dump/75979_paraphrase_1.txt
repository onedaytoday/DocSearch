### LONGFRESH 0C Storage

The LONGFRESH 0C compartment maintains a constant temperature of around 0°C, ideal for preserving the freshness and quality of various food items. The adjustable shelves can be moved up or down to accommodate different bottle heights. Ensure that items are positioned correctly to allow for optimal airflow and cooling.

This compartment helps maintain the moisture level necessary for food preservation, preventing them from drying out. Foods such as fruits and vegetables, as well as certain meats, should be stored appropriately to retain their quality over time. 

### Food Storage Guidelines

Use airtight containers and wraps for short-term storage. Foods should be placed in the LONGFRESH 0C area correctly, with lighter items at the front and heavier items at the back. Proper wrapping helps prevent spoilage and maintains the food’s texture.

Avoid storing delicate items directly next to the back wall of the compartment where frost buildup can occur. Be mindful of maintaining even temperatures and humidity levels to prolong freshness.

### Defrosting Procedures

To ensure effective performance, regularly defrost the compartment and follow the outlined cleaning instructions to maintain hygiene. Be cautious when using mechanical aids or heating methods to expedite defrosting, as this may pose safety risks.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

Regular cleaning is necessary to prevent buildup and ensure the functionality of the LONGFRESH 0C compartment. Switch off the appliance and disconnect it from the power supply before cleaning. Clean using appropriate materials that do not pose harm to the surfaces.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions

Should any issue arise with the appliance, reference the operation manual for troubleshooting instructions or contact customer service. Symptoms such as excessive cooling or lighting issues can usually be rectified by following the necessary steps outlined in the guide.

### Compliance and Regulations

This appliance adheres to EU safety regulations and standards, ensuring safe operation in household environments while conforming to relevant directives.

### Technical Note

The appliance operates by removing heat from the food content, thus cooling it while maintaining energy efficiency. Proper positioning of the appliance and regular maintenance contribute to optimal performance and longevity.
