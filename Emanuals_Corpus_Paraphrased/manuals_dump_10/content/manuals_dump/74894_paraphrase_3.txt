The Iron AIA Iron (DGR10U) features both ribbed and smooth surfaces (DGS10U and DGSS1OU) designed for single-phase operation. Its user-friendly design allows for versatile cooking on the smooth plates, suitable for both commercial and professional use. The plates are coated for scratch resistance and to prevent oxidation. The shock-proof heating elements are mounted to ensure efficient thermal conductivity, while the adjustable thermostat allows for precise control of cooking temperatures. Constructed from AISI stainless steel, the surfaces are treated to enhance food safety and resist oxidation. The unit is ETL certified and utilizes a NEMA 5-20P plug. 

For first-time use, the device is protected against grease buildup, which also aids in thermal management. Regular cleaning is essential; it should be done at least once daily or as needed, especially after cooking. Grease should be emptied regularly to maintain optimal performance and cleanliness.
