These controls include options like HIGH, LOW, REVERSE, NEUTRAL, ENGINE ON/OFF, OVER TEMP LIGHT, ATTACHMENT CLUTCH ENGAGED/FREE WHEEL. It is crucial to follow safety instructions closely to prevent serious injury or death. Warnings regarding oil pressure, fuel levels, attachment status, choke operation, parking brake, battery status, and general hazards must be acknowledged. Users must familiarize themselves with the tractor’s operation by reading the owner's manual and the safety guidelines.

The THROTTLE/CHOICE CONTROL adjusts engine speed; the ATTACHMENT CLUTCH LEVER manages the power to attachments mounted on the tractor. The ATTACHMENT LIFT LEVER raises or lowers attachments, while the CLUTCH/BRAKE PEDAL is utilized for declutching and stopping. The GEARSHIFT LEVER allows selection of the tractor's operational gear, and the IGNITION SWITCH turns the engine on and off. The LIGHT SWITCH controls the headlights.

To engage the PARKING BRAKE, ensure the tractor is stationary, disengage the clutch/brake, and secure it firstly to avoid movement before leaving the operator's seat. When stopping mower blades, shift to neutral and engage the clutch. Adjust the THROTTLE to regulate engine speed as necessary, especially when navigating hilly terrain.

To alter the mowing height, adjust the relevant controls, ensuring gauge wheels are slightly above the ground for optimal performance. The blade height should be measured from the ground and adjusted to the recommended levels for seasonal conditions.

Before starting the engine, check the oil level, ensuring it is adequately filled and secured. For operation in colder climates, fresh winter oil is recommended. Always utilize clean, uncontaminated gasoline.

Starting the engine requires sitting in the operator's seat, engaging the clutch/brake, and following the appropriate starting procedures. In warm conditions, allow the engine to warm up gradually. For cold weather, initial rough running is normal until the engine stabilizes.

Maintenance is critical; follow the recommended schedule for checking tire pressure, battery condition, and other lubrication requirements, ensuring the tractor is cleaned and serviced regularly in accordance with the service manual.

Lastly, ensure the operator presence system and interlock functions are working properly to maintain safety while the tractor is in operation. Always perform blade care and sharpening according to the guidelines, and securely reassemble components post-maintenance.

### Note: 

To clean the battery and terminals, disconnect the BLACK cable first, followed by the RED cable. Use a bright cleaning solution for both the terminals and connectors. If replacing the battery, refer to the "Service and Adjustments" section for proper procedures. Additionally, ensure that the transaxle is free of any cooling build-up, which might affect the V-belts, and check for wear after hours of operation as necessary.

Use high-rated API service SG-SL engine lubrication, selecting SAE oil based on the anticipated temperature range for optimal performance before the next oil change. Specifically, 5W-30 or 10W-30 is suitable for temperatures above 32°F. Change engine oil after every designated hours of operation or at least once a year. Always make sure to securely fasten the crankcase each time after an oil change.

To clean the air filter, do so every few hours or as needed to prevent overheating. Ensure the air screen is free from debris. Perform inspections on the muffler and spark plug annually or every few hours of operation, depending on usage, as specified in the Product Specifications section. The in-line fuel filter should also be checked and replaced if clogged.

**Warning:** To avoid serious injury, ensure the clutch/brake and gearshift are in the neutral position, and completely disconnect before performing any adjustments or service. 

When removing the mower, disengage the clutch and ensure it is positioned correctly. Follow the installation process carefully, leveling the mower housing as needed according to specifications provided.

**To Replace the Mower Blade Drive Belt:** Follow the designated steps for belt removal and installation found in this section. Check and adjust the brakes securely, inspecting both the clutch/brake and driving mechanisms.

If the steering wheel is misaligned, adjust it accordingly, ensuring the wheels are positioned properly concerning the tractor's frame. 

To start the engine with a weak battery, utilize jumper cables by connecting the RED cable to the positive terminals and the BLACK cable to the negative terminals as instructed. Reverse this order when removing the cables.

Replace the headlight bulb as needed, ensuring it fits securely into the socket. For fuse replacement, use automotive-type fuses as specified.

**To Adjust the Throttle Control Cable:** If not operating at factory settings, adjustments can be made according to specified guidelines. 

Always store the tractor properly during the off-season and perform necessary cleaning and maintenance to prevent deterioration. 

### Troubleshooting Chart:

**Problem:** Choked engine  
**Cause:** Improper starting procedures  
**Correction:** Refer to the operation section for guidance. If the engine is flooded, empty and refill with fresh fuel.

### Service Notes

#### Recommended Guidelines for Safe Operation on Inclines   
**Slope Indicator:** Align the indicator along the dotted line. Only ascend or descend hills, not traverse across them.  

**Degree of Slope:** Ensure visibility by aligning with a vertical tree or other upright reference point on the hill.  

**Warning:** To prevent serious injury, avoid operating the tractor near the edge of slopes.
