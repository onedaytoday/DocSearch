**Instructions for Operation and Installation of the FTA1100**

---

**INTRODUCTION**

This document covers the installation and operational guidelines for the FTA1100 system. Please read all instructions thoroughly for proper implementation. For any uncertainties, contact support or seek factory service. The FTA1100 complies with UL218, CSA, and various national standards including NEMA and NFPA.

**MOUNTING THE CONTROLLER**

- **Wall Mounting Plate:** Ensure the mounting location is secure. Use the appropriate anchors and washers for the wall type. Securely fasten the controller to the mounting surface using four anchors. 
- **Base/Legs Mounting (Optional):** Begin by unpacking and inspecting the mounting hardware. Confirm that all components are intact and ready for installation.

**ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS**

Follow proper procedures for electrical connections, ensuring all wiring corresponds with national standards. Ensure power disconnections during servicing. Connect AC supply and battery terminals according to the labeling on the controller (CB1 for AC, CB2 and CB3 for batteries).

**SYSTEM PRESSURE CONNECTIONS**

Connect the system pressure input to the designated FNPT port on the controller, consistent with safety regulations.

**PROGRAMMING THE MARK II XG**

Turn on the device and follow the onboard instructions to configure timers and interlocks. The interface provides visibility into system status including active alarms, power availability, and operational states. 

**USER SETTINGS**

Customize the display settings, including brightness and contrast. You can also adjust language preferences, pressure units, and set access levels for security (password management).

*Note: Be aware of potential risks associated with incorrect setups, as it may impact fire protection systems. Always ensure proper understanding of these settings.*

**FINAL CONFIGURATION TIMERS AND PRESSURE CONTROLS**

Adjust timers for system start-up and shut down sequences, ensuring continuous operations meet specified parameters.
