### OIL CARE 

To initiate, switch to the cooling mode and open the drain valve by rotating it counterclockwise to allow for oil collection. Clean the trough and replace the cover securely.

### CHANGING THE FRYING OIL

When the oil becomes degraded, follow these steps: switch to cooling mode, allow the trough to cool, and then drain the oil through the valve. Dispose of the used oil appropriately.

### CLEANING

Ensure the system is cooled down before cleaning. Turn off the valve and clean the trough thoroughly. Use a clean cloth for the trough and valve, and consider using a high-pressure cleaner for extensive cleansing. Clean the front area appropriately, avoiding any abrasive methods that might cause damage. 

### SHUTTING DOWN

To properly shut down, follow the prescribed procedure, especially when temperatures drop below 32°F (0°C). Protect the trough with a thin layer of oil, which should be done regularly.

### MALFUNCTIONS

If the system malfunctions due to overheating and the STB trips, a defective thermostat or heating element may be the cause. Report any issues to service promptly. 

For further assistance, always contact customer service for troubleshooting and repairs.

### GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

These guidelines include installation, operational instructions, safety precautions, and maintenance protocols. Ensure compliance with all safety regulations during use. 

### ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

Installation requires proper protection measures at connection points. 

### OPERATIONAL DETAILS

The thermostat (STB) and controls are designed for efficient operation, including options for temperature regulation and timing during frying. 

Always adhere to recommended frying temperatures and maintenance practices to ensure optimal operation.
