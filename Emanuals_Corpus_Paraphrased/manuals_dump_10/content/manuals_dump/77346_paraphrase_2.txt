### How to Operate the Machine

#### Initial Setup and Operations Before Use
Before starting, ensure the seat is properly adjusted by securing the four screws once you have found the ideal position. Adjust the tire pressure to the specified levels.

#### Refueling and Oil Filling
**Warning!** Never use an open flame near the fuel tank. Avoid smoking during refueling. Check fuel levels by removing the tank cover and using a screwdriver to reach the minimum and maximum indicators. Always ensure the tank is properly sealed after checking.

#### Safety Precautions
**Warning!** Do not use the machine without the grass-catcher protection in place. Regularly verify that all safety devices are functioning properly; consult a licensed service provider if issues arise.

#### Brake System Check
Regularly assess the braking system for efficiency. If repairs are needed, seek assistance from a licensed service provider.

#### Blade Maintenance
Ensure the blades are correctly sharpened. Use protective gear while inspecting or sharpening the blades.

#### Starting and Operating the Engine
**Warning!** Perform all operations carefully, as exhaust gases are toxic. Adjust the choke for cold starts, toggle between slow and fast settings, and ensure the engine starts smoothly before operating. If the engine falters, shut it off and troubleshoot.

#### Transporting the Machine
**Warning!** When transporting, ensure the machine is secured and not in motion. Follow safety guidelines for effective transport.

#### Grass Cutting Guidelines
For optimal performance, use the highest speed and ensure the machine does not encounter solid debris. Adjust cutting height based on ground conditions to prevent clogs.

#### Grass-Catcher Maintenance
Empty the grass-catcher when full, ensuring the machine is off before doing so. Check for blockages and clear them promptly.

#### Post-Operation Protocol
After use, set the speed to slow, turn off the machine, and ensure the battery is charged if it has been in operation for an extended period. Clean the machine thoroughly to remove grass and debris.

#### Long-Term Inactivity
For prolonged inactivity (over a month), disconnect the battery and recharge as necessary. Regularly maintain battery health and system cleanliness.

#### Slope Operation
When operating on slopes, slow down before turning and ensure the machine is stable. Use caution to minimize the risk of slipping.

#### Maintenance Recommendations
**Warning!** Disconnect power before attempting any cleaning or repairs. Wear appropriate safety gear and ensure compliance with maintenance instructions.

#### Routine Maintenance
Follow the manufacturer's lubrication schedule and recommended oil types. Pay attention to engine care, ensuring proper function by following guidelines and performing regular check-ups.

#### Battery Care
Maintain the battery by connecting it properly and following manufacturer's recharge instructions. Regular checks will ensure longevity.

#### Blade Sharpening and Balancing
Regularly sharpen blades to avoid damage and maintain cutting efficiency. Use genuine replacement parts as specified to ensure safety and performance.

### Maintenance Guidelines

#### Cutting Deck Alignment
For optimal performance, ensure the front of the cutting deck is positioned lower than the rear. Confirm that the deck is aligned correctly before operating. If adjustments are required, consult a Licensed Service technician.

#### Blade Engagement and Brake Adjustment
The blade engagement should be set to operate within seconds. If this fails to occur, seek assistance from a Licensed Service technician. 

**WARNING:** Do not perform any additional brake maintenance beyond what is outlined in this manual.

#### Drive Belt Tension Adjustment
Ensure the drive belt tension is appropriate when disengaged. This can be gauged by checking the belt's slack, ensuring it meets prescribed measurements from designated points.

#### Wheel Replacement and Repair
To replace wheels, use a screwdriver to remove load-bearing components, including washers. It is crucial to apply grease to the washer and components for optimal performance. Ensure parts are correctly fitted and aligned.

#### Electric and Protection System
This system features protective screws and a cover to maintain safety. If the electric system is not functioning correctly, repairs may require a delay. Always replace blown fuses with the same type, and if issues persist, consult a Licensed Service technician.

#### Replacement of Belts
Always use genuine replacement belts to maintain system integrity. Consult a Licensed Service technician for assistance.
