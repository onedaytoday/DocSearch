Utilize the fan-controlled defrosting function to thaw foods without applying heat. This is especially beneficial for items covered with frostings or icings, such as cheesecakes. Monitor the food as it defrosts, and keep in mind that meat should be thawed promptly to avoid bacterial growth. Once defrosted, cook food immediately.

Before cleaning, turn off the appliance and allow it to cool. Avoid using bleach-based cleaners, as they may damage the finishes. For exterior cleaning, use a soft cloth with mild cleaners, ensuring to wipe off promptly. When cleaning the oven's interior, refer to the specific guidance for your model.
