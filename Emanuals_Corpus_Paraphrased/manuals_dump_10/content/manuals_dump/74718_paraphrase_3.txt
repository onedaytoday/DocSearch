### DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLIANCE
- Fresh Food Compartment 
- Cold Food Compartment 

#### OPERATION
To start, set the thermostat to the desired temperature; the yellow light indicates operation. If altered, the thermostat must be switched off for an appropriate cooling period. 

The red warning light activates if internal temperatures exceed acceptable limits, indicating that fresh food should not be stored until conditions stabilize. When using the fast-freeze function, allow sufficient time for food items to freeze thoroughly. 

Perform manual operations as needed, keeping the compartment door closed to maintain temperature integrity.

### HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES 
All food must be stored in accordance with safety regulations to prevent contamination:

- Allow food to cool before placing it in the appliance. 
- Foods should be covered and not overcrowded to ensure adequate cooling.
- Maintain cleanliness by regularly sanitizing the interior surfaces and utensils.

### DEFROSTING 
Ice buildup can hinder performance. If frost becomes thick, switch off the appliance and follow defrosting guidelines. 

For effective defrosting: 
- Place layers of newspaper inside the unit to absorb moisture.
- Set the thermostat to a higher setting until defrosting is completed.

Ensure all food is removed during the defrosting process to prevent damage. Avoid refreezing foods that have been thawed and warmed to higher temperatures.

### Installation

Position the unit efficiently in a location where temperatures remain below 10°C (50°F) or above 32°C (90°F). Ensure the unit operates in an environment free from heat and direct sunlight. Allow sufficient clearance around the back and top of the unit for airflow.

The installation should ensure there are no restrictions at the back or on top. Maintain a distance of several inches from walls or other objects. 

To prepare the unit, gently rest it on its back and permit a gap of a few inches from the base to prevent any obstruction. Carefully unscrew the top and base components for proper assembly. Follow the instructions for securing screws and positioning the unit correctly.
