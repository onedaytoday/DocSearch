The Reference Remote facilitates various functions, including connectivity via USB. *Note: This is not applicable for TVs.* 

The remote's front panel can be closed, but when opened, it allows access to all controls. If the remote is at the forefront, pressing a button will adjust the volume or switch the TV channel. During recording sessions, it enables playback of the captured content. Additionally, if it is at the forefront, it can access previous channels or navigate through channel numbers. 

The remote allows you to play or fast-forward programs, displaying recorded content or live shows. It can also reveal or hide the on-screen display while managing sound levels.

To rewind, users can specify a duration in seconds, while fast-forwarding is also available for the same timeframe. The remote provides high-speed options for both functionalities. The Stop/Reveal button activates the reveal feature for text.

For recording, the remote supports functions to adjust size and manage ongoing recordings. Users can monitor these via the info button, which accesses recording details and available software.

The remote operates seamlessly both during recording and playback, ensuring that cached data is efficiently managed. Functions like HOLD and SELECT enable full-screen viewing and additional navigation options.
