**EOG Overview**

**Introduction**  
This document is aligned with British standards, specifically the EU Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It contains essential information for the proper usage and maintenance of cooking equipment. Users must refer to the first set of instructions thoroughly, including information about food preparation. 

The guidelines cover optimal cooking practices and installation requirements, ensuring that equipment is ventilated appropriately—whether through natural or mechanical means. Prolonged use or inadequate ventilation may hinder performance. 

**Safety Precautions**  
Users should be cautious about flammable materials and observe instructions related to maintaining the housing and finish of the equipment. Perishable foods should be monitored closely to avoid spoilage.

**Operational Instructions**  
Make sure to familiarize yourself with the equipment's functionalities, including the cooling and lighting apparatuses. For lighting, ensure all settings are appropriate and safe.

**Electrical Connectivity**  
The appliance must be earthed and properly connected to prevent electrical hazards. If malfunctions occur, ensure that connections align with safety ratings.

**Cooking Techniques**  
To achieve optimal results, adjust cooking settings based on food type. Use higher settings for tasks like toasting, and rotate food for even cooking. Follow preheating instructions closely and maintain adequate shelf placement for various foods. 

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Regularly clean any build-up on surfaces to prevent fire hazards. Proper alignment of components is crucial for safety and efficiency.

**Roasting Guidelines**  
For best results with roasting, use methods that allow heat to circulate freely, and avoid obstructive coverings that could impair cooking efficiency.

**Food Preparation**  
Thoroughly thaw and prepare foods as per cooking charts. Recommended cooking times vary, and the use of a meat thermometer is advised to ensure safety and quality.

**Timer and Cooking Functions**  
Be familiar with timer settings, as indicated on the control panel. Ensure the timer is activated for desired cooking duration, and consult the function guide for optimal use.

Adhering to these instructions will enhance safety and performance while operating cooking equipment.

**WARNING: Electrical Connection Instructions**

Ensure the appliance is properly earthed, connecting it to a 220V-240V electricity supply. If a different type of supply is used, appropriate adjustments must be made. The power cord should connect to the supply without extending it using plastic or ceramic connection terminal blocks or insulation tape. To reduce the risk of electric shock, avoid running the power supply through areas where individuals may be at risk. 

**Wiring Connections:**
- Connect the BROWN wire to the terminal labeled 'L' (or RED).
- Connect the BLUE wire to the terminal labeled 'N' (or BLACK).
- Connect the GREEN and YELLOW wire to the terminal labeled 'E' or the earth terminal.

**Fuse Requirement:**
Install an appropriate amp fuse in the plug fuse holder.

**Pressure Testing:**
Access the unit via the top right panel. To perform testing, turn the head counterclockwise to disengage, then adjust the thermostat. Switch on the electricity supply; observe the indicator light, ensuring proper operation. Refer to L.P. FIG.6 for additional guidance.

**Deassembly Instructions:**
To remove the fascia panel, unscrew the four screws securing it to the top. NOTE: Be cautious of top mounts during disassembly.

**Oven or Grill Door Removal:**
Open doors slightly to facilitate removal. 

**Grill Functionality Check:**
Ensure the grill ignites properly—activate the switch when closed. Confirm that the power supply turns off when doors are fully closed.

**Setting the Time:**
Turn on the electricity supply and adjust the clock accordingly. Set the time by rotating the dial to the correct hour.

**Main Oven Check:**
Confirm the clock operates correctly and the thermostat is set to the desired temperature. The oven should ignite, indicating normal function. Observe the flow of gas to ensure it matches operational requirements. 

**Automatic Operation:**
For automatic cooking, set the clock and thermostat properly. Adjust the timer to the intended cooking duration and ensure indicators function accurately.

**Warranty Information:**
This appliance is covered for specified conditions within months of purchase due to workmanship defects, provided it was used as instructed. Repairs must be conducted by authorized service centers. Unauthorized modifications will invalidate the warranty.
