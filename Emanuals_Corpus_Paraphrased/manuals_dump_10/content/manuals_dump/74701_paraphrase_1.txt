Here's the paraphrased version of the text:

To enhance food preservation, it's essential to protect shelves with material such as plastic wrap. Food that has thawed properly should either be cooked and consumed promptly or discarded. For safety, meat should be thoroughly cleaned and can be cooked from a frozen state, while cooked items should be reheated directly after thawing.

Ensure that electrical appliances are functioning correctly according to their specifications. Guidelines and guarantees provided by the manufacturer must be adhered to. For service inquiries or parts purchase, contact the Service Force at the designated phone number or visit their website for additional support.

Regarding maintenance, maintain proper ventilation around the unit to prevent overheating or obstruction of airflow. Normal operational sounds may include occasional clicking from the thermostat. If issues arise, ensure the appliance is not overloaded and that the door seals are intact.

For cleaning, always disconnect the appliance from the power supply. Defrost the unit when frost accumulation reaches a certain thickness, and avoid using abrasive or chemical cleaners that could damage surfaces. For detailed cleaning instructions, refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines. 

Regularly ensure that all components, such as light covers and screws, are correctly fitted and maintained for optimal performance.

**Normal Sounds: Hints and Tips**

When operating your appliance, you may notice various sounds, particularly related to cooling. These sounds can sometimes indicate issues, such as airflow obstructions. If you hear clicking or whirring noises while the thermostat is operating, it may affect food cooling. Ensure food items are arranged in a manner that allows proper airflow, avoiding overlap and ensuring the appliance door closes tightly. 

**Food Performance:**

Monitor the food temperature and ensure the thermostat is set correctly to maintain freshness. Over time, frost buildup can occur, which may require defrosting. Foods should be placed in suitable containers to minimize thawing or water accumulation on surfaces. 

**Refrigeration Guidelines:**

- Shellfish and ice cream should not have ice crystals if stored properly.
- Meat must be thoroughly cooked and stored separately from ready-cooked foods.
- Breads should remain sealed to retain moisture.
- Ensure that all food is labeled and stored in airtight conditions to promote longevity.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Regularly clean the shelves and ensure they are correctly positioned. If malfunctions arise, consult the Service Force. Routine maintenance is crucial for optimal performance, and any unusual sounds or behaviors should be addressed immediately.

**Customer Support:**

For parts, service, or additional guidance, please reach out to the Customer Care Department or visit www.serviceforce.co.uk. The installation must be done correctly, ensuring proper alignment with the electrical supply and adhering to temperature recommendations.

**Safety Precautions:**

Make sure that old appliances are rendered unusable to prevent accidents, especially around children. Handle setup meticulously to avoid potential hazards and ensure that the appliance operates under specified temperature ranges. 

**Technical Specifications:**

Refer to the appliance's technical specifications for optimal performance, including power supply voltage, capacity ratings, and energy consumption details. Ensure food is stored properly to prevent freezer burn or spoilage, and familiarize yourself with operating procedures for best results. 

Please adhere to all operational guidelines for safe and effective use of your appliance.

The colored indicators on the appliance align with the E.E.C. Directive regarding interference.

Before commencing, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply. If necessary, use the appropriate tools, such as a cross-slotted screwdriver and a wrench, to assist with installation. The wiring setup should correspond with the following color codes: the Earth wire should be yellow; the N (neutral) wire should be indicated by a specific color (not provided), and the L (live) wire should be red. Ensure correct placement of rear spacers, requiring screws for secure attachment to the walls.

In positioning, measure from the floor to achieve the desired height, ensuring stability by tightening all fixing screws. Follow the provided illustrations closely for correct assembly. Also, ensure ventilation is unobstructed, following the arrows indicated.

It is essential to retain this instruction manual for future reference regarding safe operation and troubleshooting. If there are any issues with the appliance, avoid attempting repairs unless you are properly trained. In such cases, always consult authorized service personnel.
