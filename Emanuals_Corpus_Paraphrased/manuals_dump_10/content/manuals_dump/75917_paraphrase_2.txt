## Operating Instructions

### Controls

The refrigerator has various switches for power supply and operation. The thermostat controls the temperature settings. Ensure the proper gas supply is operational before starting the unit.

### Starting the Refrigerator

To initiate the LP operation, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the gas shut-off valve is open.
2. Press the power switch and adjust the thermostat to the highest setting.
3. Wait for the indicator light to illuminate. If not, check your connections and ensure the gas supply is sufficient.
4. For termination, revert the thermostat and switches to the off position.

### Winter Operation

For cold weather, it is advised to cover the cooling vents to optimize performance during colder months.

### Regulating the Temperature

Allow several hours for the refrigerator to reach the desired operating temperature. Ensure that the thermostat is appropriately set for efficient cooling.

### Travel Catch

Adjust the travel catch to secure the door during transit. Ensure it is tightly fitted to prevent air leaks.

### Food Storage

Store food items carefully to avoid spoilage. Allow hot items to cool before placing them in the refrigerator to maintain proper temperatures.

### Ice-Making

Refer to the manual for instructions on creating ice and managing freezer storage effectively.

### Defrosting

Keep frost buildup minimal as it can affect performance. Regular defrosting is necessary when frost becomes excessive.

### Cleaning the Refrigerator

Use a cloth with a mild cleaning solution to keep the interiors clean. Avoid strong abrasive materials to prevent damage.

Make sure to follow these instructions closely to ensure optimal performance and safety of your refrigerator.

### BUILDING-IN

The relationship between the cooker and the radiated heat from below can impact heat performance, leading to increased operational inefficiencies. For this reason, the vehicle should be oriented southward, which aids in managing heat and combustion. The cooker should be sheltered adequately to prevent obstruction of airflow to the cooling system, as this can also affect performance. 

Refer to the TECHNICAL DATA for details on installation. The tor (tornado) should be positioned such that it’s accessible for maintenance, with the screws fastened securely to withstand vehicle dynamics. Ensure the screws pass through the appropriate mounting area, allowing for necessary clearance adjustments. Use high-quality insulation (PU) where needed to enhance efficiency.

### VENTILATION OF THE UNIT

Proper ventilation is crucial for optimal performance, especially at high temperatures. Fresh air should flow through the designated inlet and recess, ideally maintaining a temperature of C° or higher. The design allows for easy inspections and repairs without requiring removal of components.

Ensure the external area of the vehicle is protected from debris and winter conditions; this includes sealing off any potential openings. The mounted unit should maintain a specified connection type, preventing integrated models as appropriate. 

### LP GAS CONNECTION

Use the specified type of LP gas for operation. Ensure that the pressure supplied to the refrigerator is appropriate, noting the specifications on the reducing valve. Caution: only use authorized, continuously operated, threaded connections; avoid push-on connections. The supply should be adequately sealed and routed for safe servicing. 

### ELECTRICAL CONNECTION

When connecting electrical systems, comply with current I.E.E. regulations. Ensure all wiring is properly earthed, and utilize the appropriate outlet and coupler. Important wiring colors should be adhered to: 
- **Green-and-yellow** for Earth 
- **Blue** for Neutral 
- **Brown** for Live 

These must connect correctly to the corresponding terminals. 

WARNING: This appliance must be earthed, especially in regions outside the UK. Ensure the unit operates with the specified current rating and that the battery leads are appropriately routed. Maintain a reliable connection to the charger for consistent operation. 

### MOUNTING OF FRONT FRAME

For models RM and RM4213, follow specific guidelines ensuring secure installation and optimal functionality.
