### paraphrased text:

The ZT LZ LR acoustic LS LC C operates in a soft mode (soft deactivated) which primarily heats food efficiently, particularly items with high thermal conductivity. This approach minimizes overheating and burning. When the soft mode is activated, heating is tailored to the specific food type, preventing sticking or browning.

The clock display (AZ) indicates time, while (AT) shows the cooking phase; the switch (S) allows for the activation of HACCP appliances, which can also be analyzed through the THERMACAM system. By pressing the HACCP button (C), the indicator lights (LC) illuminate, activating the clock (AZ) and heating process (TT). 

Turning off the cooking process activates the HACCP function (C), which will deactivate with further button interactions. The mechanical tilting operation engages via access controls (H) when switches are adjusted. This includes manual options for emptying (K), turning, and self-locking mechanisms.

Users can easily select temperature settings (T), ranging from 110°C (230°F) for lower heat to above 111°C (231°F) for higher settings. If the temperature drops below specified thresholds, it will switch modes accordingly and cut off power during cooking interruptions.

When cooking meat, recommended temperatures include initial roasting at 200°C (391°F), then adjusting for proper cooking. Poultry specs advise starting at 140-160°C (284-320°F) before finishing at 80°C (176°F). Proper loading techniques consider 1 inch space from the heating element to avoid burning.

For cleaning, appliances must be cooled and shut off prior to maintenance. Clean components with absorbent materials, avoiding any abrasive substances that could cause damage. Specific cleaning procedures are mandated to ensure optimal performance and to mitigate malfunction risk.

In case of operational issues, indicators on the display will alert users via acoustic signals. The service procedures involve acknowledging alerts and potentially contacting service support for technical issues. Compliance with operational regulations is crucial for safety and efficiency in appliance usage.
