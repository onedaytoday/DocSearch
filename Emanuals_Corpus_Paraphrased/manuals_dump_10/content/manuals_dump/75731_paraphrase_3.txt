### COOLMATIC/FROSTMATIC Function Overview

The **COOLMATIC** feature is responsible for effectively cooling your appliance, indicated by a yellow light when activated. Once the desired temperature is selected, the feature will operate for a predetermined number of hours. The actual temperature will also be displayed, allowing for manual adjustments if necessary. 

The **FROSTMATIC** function, designed for optimal preservation of fresh food, also has a visual indicator when enabled. It can be manually switched on or off, and if activated manually, it will turn off automatically after a set duration. 

### Appliance Operation and Control

To power off the appliance, press both the ON/OFF buttons simultaneously for a few seconds until a countdown appears. This feature helps manage energy consumption effectively. When power is interrupted, the appliance can resume normal operations by holding the ON/OFF buttons again.

### Temperature Management and Safety

Regular inspection of the appliance is essential to avoid unintentional closures that can contribute to spoilage or mold. Use a thermometer to monitor the internal temperature, especially for meat and perishables, ensuring it stays below 5°C. This proactive approach helps maintain food safety, as outlined in guidelines from the Food Standards Agency.

### Food Placement and Storage

Arranging shelves appropriately can enhance cooling efficiency. It’s important to leave space between bottles to allow for air circulation. Always cover food items to prevent contamination and promote optimal storage conditions. 

### Defrosting and Maintenance

The defrosting process accumulates moisture in a trough at the back of the appliance, which should be monitored regularly for frost buildup. If ice exceeds a certain thickness, it is essential to defrost the unit to maintain efficiency.

### Appliance Sounds and Performance

Normal operational sounds may occur, such as whirring from the compressor. If sounds are unusual or persistent, it may indicate a malfunction requiring attention. Always ensure food is organized effectively to allow proper airflow and cooling.

### Cleaning Guidelines

Before cleaning, ensure the appliance is disconnected from the power supply. Use suitable cleaning products and avoid harsh chemicals that may damage surfaces. Regular cleaning can prevent build-up and maintain hygiene within the appliance.

### Troubleshooting Malfunctions

In the event of a malfunction, refer to the troubleshooting section for guidance. If issues persist, contact a qualified service technician. Proper maintenance and attention to the appliance’s operational indicators can help prevent potential issues and ensure longevity.
