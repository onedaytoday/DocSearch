### Troubleshooting and Operating Instructions

For any oversights, please consider the following operational details. The E10 and E20 models will emit a sound every few seconds once activated, similar to the E40 and EF0 models. Ensure that if service is required, it is performed while the system is completely shut down. The E40 hose must be secured tightly. Proper installation is crucial; check to ensure everything is correctly assembled and the buttons are fully engaged.

If a blockage occurs, immediately address it. Ensure the hose is clear, especially for models E10 and E20. Inspect the settings to ensure they are correct, and if necessary, redistribute the load or clean the hoses as needed. If you experience an unsatisfactory performance, it may be due to clogs or improper settings.

Should the error indicators activate, check the door seals and ensure the system is evenly balanced. Redistribute any excess load, as this may affect performance. Ensure compatibility with other motors if modifications are made.

For service inquiries or technical support, please retain purchase information. Refer to the technical specifications regarding water supply requirements, and consult the reference charts for washing guidelines based on fabric types, including ECO, Synthetics, Wool, and Handwash options.

During installation, make sure the hoses are securely fastened to avoid obstructions. Check the placement of the appliance to ensure it is not near a heat source that could cause damage.

In the event of electrical issues, it's crucial to ensure proper grounding. The appliance must be connected using the recommended wire configurations: typically, the Earth wire should be connected to the terminals marked for grounding. The use of a certified plug, meeting BS1363/A or BSI standards, is essential.

If the appliance requires servicing, please contact your local authorized service provider. For recycling information, refer to local guidelines for proper disposal of household appliances.

For optimal operation, follow the recommended washing protocols and ensure loads are treated based on fabric types as indicated on the appliance.
