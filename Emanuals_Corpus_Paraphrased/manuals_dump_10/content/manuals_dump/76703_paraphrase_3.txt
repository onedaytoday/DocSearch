**Tension 031210-JA Projection Screen Installation Instructions**

For assembly, use a screwdriver to securely attach the connecting housing components. Ensure the threads of the connector housing are properly aligned, tightening them completely. Once assembled, rotate the housing clockwise with the screwdriver for a secure fit.

The assembled connector is positioned on the right side to facilitate operation via IR, RF, or wall switch controls. 

For installation, align the connecting boards (labeled C and D) with the connector housings, ensuring all components (including parts B, C, D, H, and others) are properly secured.

**Shelf Installation:** When installing the infrared-sensitive (ISSD) component, ensure no light beams are obstructed as this can interrupt the closing operation. Clear any obstructions using a soft cloth to maintain the device's longevity.

Avoid exposure to heat or fire. For troubleshooting, cease operation immediately if any issues arise. If there are malfunctions related to the IR, RF, or connected items, refer to the switch instructions provided.

**Warranty Information:** The warranty covers defects in workmanship for three years from the date of purchase. This includes GEMR (Government, Educational, Religious) purchases. For any defective products (DOA), report within business hours to obtain RMA authorization.

Please note that unauthorized returns will be refused. Ensure all items are returned without RMA approval to avoid complications. For further assistance regarding warranty and service, contact our customer service.
