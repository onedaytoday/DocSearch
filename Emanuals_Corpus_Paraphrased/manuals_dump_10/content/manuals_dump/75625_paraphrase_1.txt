**Unpacking:** If the appliance is not yet unpackaged, do so carefully, avoiding contact with any surrounding structures. 

**Water Supply Connection:** The water inlet should be connected to a household water supply with an outer diameter of 1/4 inch. Ensure that you shut off the household water supply before making connections, following all applicable instructions. If necessary, consider consulting a professional for installation to ensure proper supply connection.

**Important Note:** The minimum and maximum water temperatures for operation are 55째F (13째C) and 110째F (43째C), respectively. Position the power cord and water supply line so that they run straight back without obstruction.

**Installation Process:**
1. Adjust the front and rear supports to maintain adequate clearance.
2. Make sure all components are aligned and not binding.
3. Fasten all screws securely, tightening with an appropriate wrench when needed.

Upon completion of these steps, ensure the appliance is operational and connected to the water supply before proceeding. For any further assistance or information about normal operational sounds, visit www.electroluxusa.com.
