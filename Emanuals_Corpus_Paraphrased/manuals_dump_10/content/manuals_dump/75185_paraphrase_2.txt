By adhering to these guidelines, you can maximize the performance and safety of your oven.

### Preheating Instructions

When cooking breads, cakes, or other items, always preheat the oven. Ensure that the oven is not overcrowded, as this can cause uneven cooking and affect the temperature. The oven should reach the desired temperature before placing food inside, ideally around 25°F (12°C) higher than recommended to compensate for any temperature loss. Follow the manufacturer's instructions closely, allowing enough clearance for each item to avoid warping or inadequate cooking. 

### Convection Baking

Convection baking circulates hot air around the food, providing even cooking and browning. This method is especially effective for batch cooking and defrosting. When using convection, you may need to lower your cooking temperature by about 25°F (12°C) compared to standard baking. Ensure that food is spaced correctly on the racks for optimal airflow.

### Timed Bake and Timed Convection Bake

To set a timed bake, adjust the oven to the desired temperature (e.g., 350°F or 177°C) and select the duration. The oven will automatically turn off after the preset time. Monitor the clock to ensure proper timing for your food.

### Delayed Timed Bake and Delayed Timed Convection Bake

To program a delayed bake, configure the oven to your desired temperature and set the timer. The oven will begin cooking automatically at the specified time. Ensure to calculate settings carefully to avoid undercooking or overcooking.

### Broiling Instructions

When broiling, preheat the oven to red-hot, typically around 550°F (288°C). Position the food correctly to allow for even heat distribution. It's critical not to cover the food, as this may lead to grease fires. In case of a fire, do not use water—it's advisable to have a fire extinguisher nearby.

### Self-Clean Feature

The self-cleaning option utilizes high heat to clean the oven cavity without the need for chemical cleaners. Ensure that the oven is completely empty and cool before starting. The self-clean cycle can take up to a few hours depending on the selected cleaning level, and the door will lock during this process for safety. 

### Starting the Self-Clean Cycle

To initiate the self-cleaning cycle, press the appropriate buttons, adjusting for light or heavy soil as needed. The oven will indicate when it is locked, and the cleaning process is ongoing. Once completed, wait until the oven has cooled down before opening.

### Delayed Self-Clean Cycle

To set a delayed self-clean, follow similar steps to the timed settings, ensuring the oven is closed and locked. Program the desired start time and soil level to ensure efficient cleaning. Remember, the oven will automatically turn off after the cleaning process is complete.

### General Cleaning Instructions

**Cleaning Procedure:** Ensure the oven is turned off and completely cool. Promptly address any spills or heavy grime. Regular cleaning can reduce the need for more intensive cleaning sessions later.

**Cleaning Painted, Decorative, and Chrome Parts:** Use a cloth to wipe these surfaces clean, applying grease remover directly where necessary. Avoid using abrasive cleaners as they can scratch the finish. Always clean with the oven turned off. For stubborn grease, use a suitable cleaner, applying it with a cloth or towel. 

**Oven Light Shield and Cleaning:** Remove the light shield for cleaning as instructed. 

### Important Service Information

In case of operational issues, such as control beeping or error codes F1 through F10 displaying, the first step is to reset the oven by pressing "CANCEL" or consulting an authorized service provider. 

**If the Oven Doesn’t Operate:** Ensure the power supply is connected properly. If the oven light is not functioning, it may simply be a burned-out bulb which can be replaced following the provided instructions.

### Self-Cleaning Cycle

Ensure the oven door is properly closed before initiating the self-cleaning cycle. If smoking occurs during broiling, adjust the meat's position for better clearance and ensure proper preheating.
