### Operating Functions

**Off Condition**  
Closing the switch activates both the main and secondary interlock switches. This allows A.C. power to be supplied to the system. The display will show "WELCOME; PRESS CLEAR AND PRESS CLOCK." To set the clock, first press the STOP/CLEAR button. Then press CLEAR, and the cooking condition will be displayed. By selecting a number and pressing START, the following operations will take place: the appropriate relays will close, activating the connected components as follows:

- **Relays**:  
  - RY: Turntable  
  - RY2: Secondary  
  - RY3: [Component]  
  - RY4: A.C.  

The A.C. supply will be approximately [specify] high voltage. The microwave power is then directed through the cavity, where it is utilized to cook the food.

**Cooking Condition**  
When cooking terminates, the microwave stops. The system transitions to an OFF state, powered down by the cook switch, interlock switch, and secondary interlock relay. This engages cooling systems and high voltage indicators to read out the cooking status.

**Operating Sequence Description**  
Upon closing the first interlock switch, the secondary interlock relay engages. If both the primary interlock switch and secondary interlock relay (RY2) are closed, any subsequent activation may lead to a blown fuse.

**Power Levels**  
The available power levels range from P-0 to P-90, correlating to various A.C. supply levels via relay RY2. Cooking operates in a Vari-Mode, with specific ON/OFF time ratios for different power settings as detailed below:  

- P-HI: 0 seconds  
- P-90: 9 seconds  
- ...  
- P-0: 0 seconds

**Ventilation Methods**  
- **Hot Air Exhaust (Vertical Venting)**: Air is directed from below through grease filters, exiting from the top of the unit.  
- **Horizontal Venting**: Similar to vertical but configured for lateral airflow.  
- **Recirculation (Inside Venting)**: Air circulates through a charcoal filter before returning to the cooking area.

**Electrical Components**  
Key components include thermal cutouts, fuses, resistors, noise filters, and capacitors that regulate power and prevent overheating. Notable details:
- Ensure terminal connections comply with markings.
- Specific models may utilize an absolute humidity sensor.

**Safety Considerations**  
Before replacing any blown components or fuses, thoroughly test the door sensing switch and other interlock systems for proper function. Follow troubleshooting protocols to isolate and resolve faults, ensuring all electrical connections are secure and compliant with safety standards.

### Note:  
All circuit designs and components are subject to modification without notice. Always refer to official service documentation for specific models.

### Troubleshooting Guide  
When troubleshooting, ensure the microwave is disconnected from its power source, and isolate all leads to prevent electric shock. Complete all tests methodically, ensuring proper safe handling of components.

**Component Testing Procedures for FMV156 Models**

**Models:** FMV156DBE, FMV156DSE, FMV156DQE, FMV156DCF

1. **Power Issues:**
   - Check if there's low voltage or no power at the outlet. Inspect for shorted or damaged power cord and verify wiring for open or short circuits.
   - Test the hood motor capacitor, hood lamp or socket, turntable off condition, turntable motor, fan motor, and oven lamp or socket.

2. **Relay and Control Systems:**
   - Assess relays RY-1 through RY-5 and inspect the key unit and control unit. Verify proper operation of the hood fan motor, thermal cut-out, monitor fuse, monitor switch, and interlock systems.

3. **Heating Functionality:**
   - Ensure that when food is placed inside, the lights (work light or night light) illuminate and the turntable operates. If the food is not cooked adequately, verify the cooking and defrost functions.

4. **Microwave Output Power Testing:**
   - Disconnect the power cord and isolate the unit. Measure high voltages carefully during the cook cycle. Use a thermometer or thermocouple to gauge microwave output power after input calibration.

5. **High Voltage Component Testing:**
   - Conduct high voltage rectifier and capacitor tests by disconnecting the supply and measuring the respective terminals for continuity. Replace any defective components.

6. **Thermal Cut-Out Testing:**
   - Inspect the cavity thermal cut-out and the magnetron temperature fuse once the unit is powered down. Confirm that they closes below specified temperatures.

7. **Interlock System Testing:**
   - Test the primary interlock switch and the secondary relay for correct operation, ensuring they function properly under specified conditions.

8. **Hood Fan Motor Testing:**
   - Disconnect power and check the continuity of the hood fan motor. Ensure that the motor operates and there are no shorted connections.

**Caution:** High voltage is present during testing; take necessary precautions. Ensure that all wiring is correctly connected and that protective components are in place to prevent electrical hazards.

### Test Procedures for FMV156 Series Models
