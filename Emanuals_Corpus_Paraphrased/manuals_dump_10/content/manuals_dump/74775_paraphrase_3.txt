To properly defrost the unit, it is important to address frost build-up, which can affect both the internal and the food contents. To initiate defrosting, first turn off the appliance and disconnect it from the power supply. Remove any food items and clean the interior thoroughly before restoring power. 

For efficient operation, refer to the troubleshooting chart for guidance on common issues. Abnormal sounds or flashing lights may indicate that the door is not closed properly or that the temperature is set too high, leading to excessive frost accumulation. Ensure that food items are not overcrowded and that proper air circulation is maintained. 

In troubleshooting, check that the unit is connected to the correct electrical supply and that the power switch is functioning adequately. If any issues persist, consult the service manual or contact a technician for assistance. 

When installing, make sure the appliance is positioned correctly as indicated on the rating plate, ideally in a location where the ambient temperature remains between the specified limits (e.g., +10°C to +32°C for SN models). Ensure proper ventilation around the unit to maintain efficiency.

Regarding the water supply connection, it should be installed by a qualified plumber, and all components should be checked for integrity to prevent leaks. Regular maintenance and adherence to guidelines will ensure optimal performance and longevity of the appliance.
