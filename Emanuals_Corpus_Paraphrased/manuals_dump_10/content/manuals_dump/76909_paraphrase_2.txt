To ensure a smooth and accurate installation, please review these straightforward instructions prior to beginning the process. Confirm that your installation adheres to all relevant plumbing, electrical, and other applicable codes, as referenced in these guidelines. It is standard practice to ground electrical devices such as telephones and computers to water lines, which may occur either within or away from the building. However, this grounding can lead to electrical feedback into the fountain, resulting in electrolysis that may impart a metallic taste or increase the metal content of the water. This issue can be mitigated by utilizing the appropriate materials as specified. Any drain fittings provided by the installer should be constructed from plastic to ensure electrical isolation of the fountain from the buildingâ€™s plumbing system. 

Installation instructions indicate that the wall should already be prepared for the fountain as shown. Ensure that the water supply line is properly routed through the back and thoroughly flushed prior to connecting it to the fountain. After installation, securely tighten all connections and fittings. Adjust the water supply to the fountain, ensuring it is insulated and properly set. The recommended pressure for the water supply should be between PSIG, and if the pressure exceeds this or falls below 20 PSIG, the warranty may be voided. 

For troubleshooting and maintenance, consult the assembly instructions and ensure all services are performed by a qualified technician. Installer, please take note of the parts list and ensure all components are available. For replacement parts, contact your local distributor or call Elkay Manufacturing Company.
