**Customer Advisory**: Please utilize these operating instructions for optimal use of your appliance. Pay special attention to warnings (Warning!, Attention!) and notes regarding operation and safety.

**Additional Guidance**: This document contains crucial information about your appliance's functions, addressing any potential malfunctions in the "Something Not Working" section. For further assistance, refer to the AEG Service Force chapter.

**Appliance Overview**: This guide includes details on initial setup, operation, accessories, food preparation, defrosting, cleaning, and troubleshooting. Compliance with safety regulations is critical throughout.

**Safety Information**: Proper use is essential to avoid hazards, such as food spoilage or appliance malfunction. If the appliance becomes operationally deficient, it could pose risks, including suffocation hazards for children, so keep it out of their reach. Use caution around flammable materials and consider having a fire extinguisher accessible.

**Startup and Operation**: Prior to usage, ensure the appliance is upright for several hours after switching it on. Adjust the temperature using the ON/OFF switch and ensure the cooling settings are optimally set. Follow guidelines for food placement and storage to avoid cross-contamination.
