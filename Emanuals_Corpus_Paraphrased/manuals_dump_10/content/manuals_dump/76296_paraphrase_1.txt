The AEG-ELECTROLUX EWD1477 washer-dryer requires specific care and attention to ensure safety and effectiveness. It is crucial to avoid washing items that could pose fire hazards, such as those contaminated with cooking oil, as they can spontaneously ignite due to heat and oxidation. Always follow guidelines for washing items that might be affected by such oils or chemicals; they should be pre-washed to minimize risks. 

Items like textiles with rubber coatings, textured materials, or those containing flammable properties should not be placed in the washer-dryer, as they may catch fire when heated. Ensure that any clothing or bedding used does not obstruct the dryerâ€™s operation, and keep hazardous materials away from the machine. Additionally, safeguard children and vulnerable individuals from potential suffocation hazards by keeping them away from the appliance. 

For precise cleaning and operational instructions, consult the user manual specifically designed for the AEG-ELECTROLUX EWD1477.
