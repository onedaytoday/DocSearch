**Defrosting Guidelines for Frost-Free Appliances**

To completely defrost a frost-type appliance, it is crucial that the internal food items are not present during operation. To begin the defrosting process, follow these steps: 

1. Turn off the appliance using the switch.
2. Disconnect it from the electrical supply.
3. Remove all food items and clean the interior thoroughly.

If you find frost accumulating on food or inside the appliance frequently, consult the technician for assistance using the provided information chart. During operation, unusual sounds may occur, which is normal. However, if these sounds are continuous or concerning, verify that the appliance is functioning correctly.
