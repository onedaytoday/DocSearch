### Introduction

This document serves as an introduction to the British Council Directive 90/396/EEC, which pertains to proper usage and maintenance of the cooker. It provides essential guidelines for correctly operating the cooker, ensuring safety and efficiency. 

### Lighting the Cooker

To ignite the hotplate, adjust the heat settings to the maximum level. It’s important to release the ignition button promptly. Warning: If a fire starts on the hotplate, immediately cover it with a cloth or another suitable material to smother the flames. 

### Cooking Instructions

When using the cooker, it's essential to monitor the temperature settings closely. Adjust the heat from 'OFF' to 'HIGH' and then down to 'LOW' as necessary. Regularly check on the food to ensure even cooking. Keep in mind that different food items require varying heat settings; for example, toast requires higher heat whereas thicker foods need a lower setting to cook thoroughly.

### Preheating

Preheating the oven is generally recommended for baked goods and when reheating certain meals. Proper positioning of food within the oven can significantly affect cooking times and temperature distribution.

### Hotplate Functions

The hotplate should be adjusted according to the type of food being prepared. Higher temperatures are suitable for items such as chips, whereas stews and similar dishes may require moderate heat. Always exercise caution with the hotplate to prevent burns, particularly when handling heavy cookware.

### Roasting Guidelines

When roasting, ensure that meat or poultry items are not overcrowded on the shelf, as this can hinder heat circulation and extend cooking times. Consider using a thermometer to check internal cooking temperatures, especially for thicker cuts of meat.

### Cleaning Procedures

It is crucial to maintain cleanliness to prevent the risk of fire hazards from grease splatters. Utilize appropriate cleaning materials and follow the manufacturer's instructions for maintaining the cooker’s appearance and functionality.

### Summary

The provided guidelines cover essential operational instructions and safety measures for the effective use of the cooker, including lighting, cooking, preheating, and cleaning protocols. Following these instructions will enhance the overall performance and safety of the appliance.

### Revised Technical Instructions

**General Information**  
Avoid using combustible items near the cooker, including covers. Ensure that the cover is securely in place. To maintain proper function, keep the cooker clear from the front to the rear, especially at the corners. Regular maintenance is necessary, typically every few months.

**Battery and Ignition**  
The AA battery is located at the front of the unit. Light the burner using a match once the battery is installed. If there's an issue with the ignitor, this may prevent lighting.

**Cooking Guidelines**  
Ensure that items do not obstruct the trays or cause any fire hazards. Use the hotplate light indicator to check if it is functioning; if not, troubleshoot accordingly. Follow recommended cooking instructions for optimal results, ensuring even cooking.

**Maintenance Instructions**  
Servicing should only be performed by qualified technicians. Direct any service inquiries to the appropriate support channels. For consumer protection, refer to The Consumers' Council (GCC).

**Installation Requirements**  
Follow the installation instructions in compliance with current regulations, including BS standards. Ensure adequate ventilation, as the appliance requires a proper flow of combustion air.

**Location of Appliance**  
The cooker should not be installed in bathrooms or areas with direct moisture. Maintain a minimum distance from walls, shelves, and adjacent surfaces.

**Assembly Instructions**  
Position the appliance securely and level it using adjustable feet. Refer to the provided assembly instructions for mounting the grill and splash plate.

**Connecting to Gas Supply**  
Use only approved connections for gas supply. Ensure that the flexible tubing meets BS standards and can operate safely at up to 50MBAR. Liquid sealants should be used for threaded gas connections—do not apply PTFE tape.

**Battery Installation**  
Insert the battery as directed. 

**Pressure Testing**  
Conduct thorough pressure tests to ensure all connections are secure and functioning before use.

**Safety Checks**  
Regularly check whether the grill, hotplate, and oven are operating safely. Verify the functionality of all safety devices.
