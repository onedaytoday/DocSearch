### Instructions for the Cooker

#### Introduction
This document serves as an introduction to the cooker in compliance with the British C.E. Council Directive 90/396/EEC. It provides comprehensive written instructions for users regarding the proper operation of the appliance. This cooker is designed for food preparation. Please refer to the user manual for guidance on installation and safety measures. If installation instructions are missing, you can still locate essential components like the rating plate, which is typically found on the front, top, or back of the cooker.

#### Lighting the Hotplate
To ignite the hotplate, turn the control to the highest setting. Press and hold the ignition button while keeping a safe distance from any flames. **Warning:** If a flame spreads, quickly cover it or smother it with a suitable material to prevent fire hazards. The safety cut-off will engage if the hotplate is closed off for an extended period; ensure that the gas flow is turned off when the hotplate is not in use.

#### Cooking Recommendations
- Adjust the heat setting gradually from "OFF" to "LOW" and then to "HIGH" based on your cooking requirements. 
- Regularly monitor your food to minimize burning.
- Thicker foods should be cooked on higher settings for optimal results, while delicate items can be prepared at lower settings.
- Preheating is typically recommended for optimal cooking, especially for items requiring browning or even heat distribution.

#### Shelf Positioning
Ensure that food is arranged level and spaced appropriately on the shelves for even cooking. Cooking times will vary depending on the thickness of the items. The top shelf may be used for foods that cook more rapidly than those on lower shelves. Always check the manual for specific preheating instructions based on the type of food.

#### Roasting Guidelines
When roasting meats, do not cover items unless specifically instructed, as this restricts heat circulation and affects cooking duration. Maintain an appropriate distance from the heat source to ensure uniform cooking outcomes. 

#### Cooking Chart
For reference, use the cooking chart included, which outlines shelf placements and temperatures for various food items:
- Thoroughly thaw items prior to cooking to ensure even heat distribution.
- Suggested cooking times and temperatures are provided for different recipes, including roasting of meats and baking pastries.

#### General Safety and Care
Keep areas around the hotplate free from flammable materials. Regularly check and maintain the appliance to ensure optimal performance. If issues arise, consult the service manual or contact a certified technician for assistance.

This guide serves to enhance your cooking experience while ensuring safety and efficiency in the use of your appliance.

Here’s a paraphrased version of the text in a technical yet natural manner:

**Soup Preparation and Cooking**: Begin by placing the ingredients on the hotplate for cooking. You can combine beans or meat with other foods, ensuring tight cooking. After cooking, let the mixture simmer and allow it to cool before thickening, potentially using cornflour. Be careful to avoid curdling while cooking or reheating. Food should be fully thawed before cooking and should ideally only be reheated once, whether on the cooktop or in the microwave.

**Cleaning Procedures**: To maintain cleanliness and safety, it’s essential to keep the cooking area free from splashes and spills. Use only recommended cleaning products, as harsh chemicals may damage surfaces. For the brass-plated components, a soft cloth is advised, and avoid any abrasive materials that may dull the finish. Clean the hotplate using a gentle approach to avoid damaging the surface.

**Crowns and Burners**: Ensure the crowns are clean; use scouring pads as necessary. Regularly check that they are positioned correctly to prevent burning food. If light indicators show issues, investigate the fittings and screws, ensuring they are secure. Loose components can affect performance.

**Safety and Installation Guidelines**: Prioritize safety by adhering to installation guidelines. Keep combustibles at a safe distance from the hotplate, and ensure proper ventilation to eliminate any combustion byproducts. If servicing is required, consult a qualified technician.

**Technical Specifications**: The hotplate operates at 230V-240V with specific dimensions and connections detailed in the specifications. Compliance with safety standards such as BS.6172 and BS.5440 is crucial to ensure proper function and safety in use.

**Customer Support**: For additional information or service, including troubleshooting or purchasing parts, customers can contact Service Force or refer to their website for guidance.

This paraphrase retains the meaning while enhancing clarity and readability.

### Appliance Location

The appliance should be positioned as specified below, ensuring it is installed above the countertops or directly on shelves that accommodate the hotplate. Any installation must maintain clearance above the hotplate, particularly in areas like kitchens or bathrooms. The hotplate must not be situated below ground level, whether on a boat or elsewhere.

### Installation Parts Required 

The hotplate needs to be level with the appliance height adjustments made by turning either clockwise or counter-clockwise as described. Ensure the brackets are fitted securely using the provided kit (SK.4729.A). Follow the installation instructions carefully, positioning the fixing points as illustrated in the diagrams (A, B, C).

### Connecting to Gas 

Ensure the appliance is connected to the gas supply using the designated R/8 B.S.P. threaded inlet at the rear of the hotplate. **Important:** Use only liquid sealants; do not apply P.T.F.E. tape. The connection should allow for adequate movement and flexibility while complying with current BS standards for LPG connections, including a red stripe, band, or label.

### Electrical Connection

**Warning:** This appliance must be grounded. Do not connect grounding to the gas supply piping. The appliance should be connected to a 230V-240V A.C. supply. If the molded plug is removed, dispose of it safely to avoid electric shock hazards. External wiring must adhere to I.E.E. wiring regulations, avoiding extensions with plastic or ceramic connectors.

For wiring connections, follow these color codes:

- **Brown** → Live (L)
- **Blue** → Neutral (N)
- **Green/Yellow** → Earth

Ensure an appropriate fuse is fitted in the plug holder.

### Pressure Testing

Perform pressure testing while monitoring the front and back panels. Make sure the Flame Supervision Device (F.S.D.) is correctly positioned, and confirm the proper operation of the gas jets. 

### Functionality Checks

- **Grill**: Ensure the grill initiates correctly upon activation.
- **Hotplate**: Confirm that the burner crowns are properly seated and operational. 
- **Lid Shut-off Device**: Test that it correctly prevents gas flow when the lid is closed.
- **Main Oven**: Verify that the oven thermostats respond accurately and that the gas ignites as expected.
- **Second Oven**: Check functionality similarly by adjusting the thermostat and ensuring gas flow.
- **Main Oven Light**: Check the light operation as described.
