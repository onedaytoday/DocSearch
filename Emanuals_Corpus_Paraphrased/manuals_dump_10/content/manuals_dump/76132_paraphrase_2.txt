**INSTALLING THE COOKER HOOD**

Begin by attaching the Ceiling/Support Shelf to the designated area of the shelf using the provided template. Ensure the template aligns correctly with the positions marked on the shelf. Use screws appropriate for hollow ceilings, matching the thickness specifications provided. When securing the shelf, connect it to the outlet (Ducted) using the specified screw type, making sure to cross them appropriately to stabilize the installation.

To adjust the height, position the screws according to the required elevation, and tighten them securely. Ensure all screws are fastened completely, following the provided guidelines.

The mounting structure must withstand the weight and thrust of the installation, so itâ€™s critical that it is anchored to a structurally sound area. 

For optimal extraction performance, especially if the ducting was purchased through DIY sources, maintain the shortest possible path for the duct. Avoid sharp bends where possible, and if the duct exceeds 90 degrees, ensure airflow is not obstructed. The installation must also conform to fire safety standards, such as British or DIN 4102-B1.

When selecting ducting, you have the option to either vent it from the top of the housing or through an alternate fixture. If the installation site is associated with heat sources like stoves, ensure the ducting is properly sealed or suited for that environment. If connected to heating units, make sure they are compatible with the charcoal filters installed.

Regarding the chimney assembly, it consists of several sections connected with the provided screws, ensuring they are tightly affixed. Utilize the M6 screws for attaching additional components and securely connect the lighting to the designated screws.
