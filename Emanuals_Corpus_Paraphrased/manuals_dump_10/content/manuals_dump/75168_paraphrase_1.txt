The Air-o-Steam LW GN series combines traditional cooking methods with innovative research to enhance professional creativity. It offers a versatile range of operation modes—including convection cooking—which allows for cooking without the need for gratin. The half-power steam function ensures efficient steam cooking, reducing cooking time and preserving the quality of the food. 

The control system allows for precise cooking management, with options such as "HOLD" for items like cakes, maintaining optimal temperatures automatically. It also includes features for improved cleaning and cooling, which accommodate various cooking styles both manually and electronically. 

The system complies with HACCP standards, enabling monitoring and recording of cooking parameters. Key technical specifications include a steam and convection system suitable for a range of foods, a cleaned and thermo-glazed cooking chamber height, and an integrated hose for efficient water supply. 

Several accessories are available, including GN1/1 grids for whole chickens, frying baskets, automatic water softeners, various sizes of baking trays, banquet racks, and more. An array of additional support utilities like grease collection kits, heat shields, and a range of non-stick pans ensures versatility in kitchen operations. 

Operational legends include indicators for cold water, cooling, and electrical connections necessary for troubleshooting and maintenance.
