For assistance, consult the troubleshooting section or contact customer service for expert support.

### INITIAL START-UP

Before operation, ensure the unit is connected to a grounded 115V power supply. The ON/OFF switch should be turned on, allowing power for the unit to start. Initially, allow the system to run for a few hours without interruption. 

### CYCLE SELECTOR SWITCH
The operation of the system involves a continuous flow of water into the trough, which accumulates until it reaches a specified thickness. The unit then cycles off and repeats the process. Maintaining optimal cleanliness of the ice cubes is important, as variations in thickness can affect quality.

### ICE DISPENSER OPERATION AND CARE
The ice cube thickness is factory-set. To adjust, turn the dial clockwise to increase thickness and counterclockwise to decrease it. Allow a few hours for the changes to take effect.

### SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
For optimal performance, protect the unit from sunlight and keep it in a temperature range of 45°F (7°C) to 110°F (43°C). Exceeding these limits may void your warranty. Regular maintenance, including cleaning, is critical to longevity and efficiency. Use appropriate cleaners meant for stainless steel and avoid abrasive pads that could damage the surface finish.

### CLEANING INSTRUCTIONS
Do not use steel wool or non-stainless steel-specific cleaners. If needed, use Bon-Ami or similar non-abrasive products. Regular cleaning should occur monthly, and an automatic clean cycle is recommended. Follow specific guidelines to prevent damage.

### MAINTENANCE AND DRAINING
If the unit will not be used for an extended period, disconnect it from the power supply to avoid hazards. Ensure proper drainage to prevent damage and maintain performance when the unit is not in use.

### TROUBLESHOOTING
If the unit malfunctions, check the basic operation guidelines first. Inspect water supply and connections. If issues persist, contact your service provider with the unit's serial number and model information during troubleshooting.

### SERVICE
For any required service, contact the retailer where the unit was purchased and provide necessary details for efficient handling.
