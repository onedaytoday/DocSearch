3. Verify the integrity of circuitry to mitigate interference (EMI) that may affect system performance.
4. Ensure that all electronic components operate freely without obstruction.

By maintaining awareness of these procedures and guidelines, you can ensure optimal performance and longevity of the VSG/VSSG systems.

### Section: Troubleshooting

**Reason for Issues:**  
Clicking noises may occur when the system operates intermittently, which can indicate overheating or a thermal switch malfunction. The system might only turn off when the thermal switch is engaged. During installation, ensure that the *VSG/VSSG* is set up according to the 35391SSG guidelines. The equipment should move freely, and the EEPROM memory within the system may be affected if the photochopper is malfunctioning. Ensure all screws are secure and that any visible yellow indicators are addressed. Overheating can often cause the thermal switch to activate prematurely.

**LED Indicators:**  
If the internal LED indicates an issue, check for proper functionality of both optocouplers. If either optocoupler isn't working or both need to be replaced, test them by manually operating the photochopper. Use a multimeter to check the DC levels at TP1 and TP2. Ensure the optocouplers are functioning correctly and that recalibration may be necessary. Issues might also arise from excessive external light interference or when servicing the unit without the cover in place.

**Thermal Switch Functionality:**  
Refer to the TS1 thermal switch leads on the board. They should be properly oriented for the *VSG/VSSG* system. If a thermal switch is suspected to be malfunctioning (when closed), check for a 24V supply. If the DC terminals are supplying 24V, it indicates the system is functioning normally; otherwise, further investigation into the EEPROM memory may be required if errors persist.

### Section: High Injection Capacity/Volume Troubleshooting

Symptoms may indicate that suction levels are either too high or too low, affecting operational efficiency. Evaluate suction settings and ensure they match the specifications for your equipment.
