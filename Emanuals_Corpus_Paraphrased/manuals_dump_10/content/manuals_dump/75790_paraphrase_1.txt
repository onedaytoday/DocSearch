**Technical Paraphrase:**

The unit operates continuously to prevent frost build-up, provided the products are arranged correctly. Thermostatic controls must ensure that items are not placed too closely together or improperly wrapped. Proper spacing and packaging are essential for optimal function. When food items are tightly packed, the thermostat may need adjustment to maintain adequate cooling, ensuring cleanliness and efficiency. 

For the best operating conditions, all cooling, lighting, and servicing components must be functioning correctly. Burnt components should be replaced according to specific guidelines. The unit's installation must follow the instructions in the designated chapter, ensuring it is four feet from certain surfaces. 

In terms of energy efficiency, the device has an EU Rated Class A efficiency level. It is advised to keep the machine unpacked and cleaned as per the provided instructions, especially around the ENB 32000W specifications. 

If cooling efficiency decreases, check for proper alignment of spacers and ensure the screws are secure. Insulation should remain intact, especially around heat-producing areas, and clearances should be maintained per the recommendations specified for wall-mounted installations.

When positioning the unit, ensure it can ventilate adequately. Carry out any installation steps carefully, following the product guidelines. Use the appropriate screws to secure the top cover, ensuring they are positioned correctly to avoid any damage.

Before service or maintenance, ensure the unit is earthed and that electrical connections are made according to the specified ratings. Avoid issues related to stray voltage by confirming wire colors: Brown for L (live), Blue for N (neutral), and Green/Yellow for Earth. 

For food storage, ensure that items are properly sealed and categorized according to their specific temperature requirements, with recommendations for various food types provided in a reference chart.
