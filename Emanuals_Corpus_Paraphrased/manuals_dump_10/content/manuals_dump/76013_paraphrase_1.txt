Assembly of the sawtooth head involves the rotation of the locking screw, which is designed to engage and secure the sawtooth in place. To disengage and release the head, ensure the STOP switch is set to I (START). Rotate the screw clockwise to secure, and counterclockwise to release. The sawtooth should move freely without obstruction.

When operating the system, ensure the throttle is released, and the switch is turned to O (STOP) after use. Regular maintenance is crucial; inspect the backpack for airflow and ensure the flow remains consistent. To maintain optimal performance, utilize only authorized service personnel for repairs.

Routine cleaning is essential to prevent overheating and ensure the longevity of the gearbox. Clean thoroughly every three months or after periods of heavy use. When reassembling the head, follow the specified diagram to ensure correct installation, taking care to replace worn components as necessary.

For optimal operation, maintain the cutting head at the correct height and distance from the ground to prevent excessive wear and reduced efficiency. Adjust the throttle to maintain control while cutting.

In case of any operational issues, refer to the troubleshooting section and ensure all components are functioning correctly. The authorized E.O.P. confirms compliance with applicable directives, ensuring the safety and performance of the device.
