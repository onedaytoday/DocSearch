The OSD (On-Screen Display) includes various features such as ELMO with specific functionalities. Users can navigate through the OSD, which displays options including DEFAULT CAMERA settings like BACKLIGHT, FOCUS, AUTO AE (Auto Exposure), AUTO WBC (White Balance Control), and ID DISPLAY settings. To access the camera menu, navigate through the OSD options, selecting items with the right/left controls. Adjust settings for BACKLIGHT, FOCUS, AE, WBC, and Aperture as desired. Initially, certain items will appear as <OFF> and can be switched to <ON> when necessary.

**BACKLIGHT FOCUS APERTURE**

The Backlight function compensates for low light conditions. Adjustments can be made between AUTO and MANUAL modes, affecting the internal operations of parameters like Sharpness. Additionally, diversifying the settings allows for high dynamic range (HDR) operations and brightness modifications. Users can select FOCUS and APERTURE settings based on preferences, and changes will revert to defaults automatically if not adjusted.

**AE MODE**

The AE (Auto Exposure) function provides options for automatic or manual light adjustments. Users can manipulate the IRIS, AGC (Automatic Gain Control), and SHUTTER functions to optimize light intake. Adjusting IRIS or SHUTTER affects sensitivity more significantly than the AGC.

**WBC MODE ID DISPLAY**

The WBC (White Balance Control) function helps customize color representation according to the surrounding light conditions. It features options to manually select white balance settings or set ID for display purposes. The adjustments are usable within specified limits.

**SETUP MENU**

In the SETUP MENU, users can adjust camera settings such as ZOOM SPEED, DIGITAL ZOOM, and calibrations. These changes can be either default or modified for optimizations. The settings can be reset to factory defaults if needed.

**ALARM SETTING**

The ALARM SETTING includes options for defining alarm parameters like N.O. (Normally Open) or N.C. (Normally Closed), as well as corresponding actions (e.g., preset positions, sequences) when alarms are triggered. Users can configure the system to respond appropriately based on specific criteria.

**HOME FUNCTION**

The HOME FUNCTION allows users to specify actions based on alarm triggers or operational preferences, such as navigating through predefined routes or return timings. Users can define whether specific actions occur under certain conditions.

**SEQUENCE**

SEQUENCE settings enable users to create programmed paths or behaviors for the camera system, including predefined positions, speeds, and dwell times, facilitating coordinated movement and monitoring. These settings enhance operational efficiency and effectiveness.

**AUTOPAN DWELL TIME**  
The DWELL TIME refers to the duration during which the system pauses between movements, set from 2 to X seconds. Adjustments to DWELL TIME can be made while running the sequence, and if set manually, the RUN SEQUENCE will adhere to these selections. To exit, select the item in the SEQUENCE menu and choose either rotating or motion options. The AUTOPAN LINE allows for continuous movement in preset directions (LEFT/RIGHT) without manual intervention.

To set the AUTOPAN START POINT, follow the prompted path and press <START POINT> and <ENTER> when the <TO FIND> item is highlighted. This will automatically turn on the item. Similarly, to save the END POINT, configure it and press <ENTER>. Note: The recorded START and END POINT can be accessed for adjustments, and the selected END POINT can also be altered as needed.

**DIRECTION**  
The AUTOPAN rotation direction can be set to clockwise by selecting <RIGHT> or anti-clockwise by choosing <LEFT>. The speed range for this rotation extends from minimum to maximum.

**CRUISE RUN AUTOPAN**  
Once CRUISE is initiated, the system allows manual control of the function. Exit allows recall of AUTOPAN operations as needed. To record the START of a CRUISE path, follow the prompts and then press <ENTER> to store the data. The path built will be displayed in memory during the process, and once the RECORD END is activated, the path will be finalized.

To manually run the CRUISE function post-completion, use the exit command.

**IR FUNCTION (WDR Only)**  
This feature allows the management of infrared (IR) output, optimizing visibility based on light conditions. When the IR function is engaged, it can automatically adjust brightness based on preset thresholds (<LOW>, <MID>, and <HI>). Users can select the IR COLOR mode (B/W or color) to match their needs.

**PRIVACY FUNCTION**  
The PRIVACY SWITCH enables the activation or deactivation of privacy features. When selected, it can obscure areas by shading them with preset colors (black, white, or gray). Adjust the positions of shaded areas to prevent overlapping through the CENTER control using LEFT/RIGHT navigations.

**TIME FUNCTION**  
For managing timestamps, choose <ON> for display or <NO> to disable. The settings menu allows for year, month, day, hour, and minute adjustments, with the option to save. 

**SCHEDULE FUNCTION**  
Select the SCHEDULE SWITCH option to engage or disable scheduling modes. This enables the configuration of scheduled actions, allowing users to set specific hours and minutes for various operations like PRESET, SEQUENCE, AUTOPAN, or CRUISE.

**EXIT**  
To exit the current OSD settings and functions, choose between the required operations for the IR FUNCTION. The configurations include options for automatic or manual settings and adjustments for effective function management.

**Technical Specifications**  
- **DR CAMERA**: Supports NTSC and PAL formats with BNC synchronization.
- **Scanning**: High-speed scanning capabilities with S/N Ratio specifications.
- **General**: Works within a temperature range of 0C to 40C (32F~104F).
- **Interface**: RS-485 connectivity.

**OSD Settings**  
The OSD menu includes a variety of settings covering camera options like IRIS control, exposure adjustments, alarm configurations, zoom speeds, and privacy settings. 

**Key Items for Configuration**  
Accessing the desired configuration options requires navigating through various settings in the OSD and can involve selecting items like AUTOPAN, CRUISE, or PRIVACY functionalities, along with detailed setup processes for adjusting each feature appropriately.
