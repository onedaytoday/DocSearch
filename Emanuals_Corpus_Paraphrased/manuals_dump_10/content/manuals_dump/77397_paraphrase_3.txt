### Unit and Precision Cooling: Ensuring Business Continuity

**Product Overview:**
PFH unit models, such as PFH037A-PL7 C, operate efficiently at 95°F (35°C) and 105°F (41°C) using R-407C refrigerant. The units are designed without optional features and have a capacity of up to 8 tons, utilizing either a pre-charged option or field-fabricated installation.

**Installation Considerations:**
When installing PFH units, pay attention to inspection locations and proximity to walls for service clearance. Ensure a supply of clean air and consider ground-level accessibility while adhering to all Emerson Network specifications. Promptly inspect all components upon delivery and contact Emerson Network for any discrepancies.

**Technical Specifications:**
These units boast high efficiency with internal isolation mounting, built-in protection features such as crankcase heaters, high-pressure switches, and sight glasses. Various capacities are available with optional phenolic coating for added durability.

**Maintenance and Troubleshooting:**
Regular maintenance checks are essential. Troubleshooting guides can be found in the accompanying documentation, which outlines common issues and their resolutions.

**Wiring and Electrical Setup:**
Units can be configured for both single-phase and three-phase electrical service. Proper grounding and adherence to NEC Class ratings are mandatory for safety and functionality. Ensure access to internal wiring for maintenance.

**Conclusion:**
Incorporate these PFH units into your cooling strategy for a reliable and efficient solution that meets your operational requirements while ensuring the longevity of your equipment.

### Considerations

The 3-ton unit comes factory-charged for R-407C, with provisions for connecting insulated suction lines. This applies without limitations. The 8-ton unit features insulated suction lines and can be pre-charged for R-407C, which is optional for the 3.5-ton version. It is important to follow the guidelines in the PFH Table concerning mounting and location discrepancies. For field-fabricated installations, adhere to cleanliness and pressure testing protocols. 

Note that R-407C is hygroscopic and must be handled properly to avoid contamination from the atmosphere. The integrity of the POE oil should be maintained throughout the installation process, and careful attention should be given when connecting units to ensure minimal moisture intrusion.

### Suction Unit Guidelines

Units should be connected as outlined in the PFH Table, ensuring proper alignment and height adjustments. Follow the recommended guidelines for diameter and piping lengths, with specific reference to the chart for R-407C specifications. Each component should be threaded securely, using synthetic cloth to prevent cross-threading.

### Charge Specification

Ensure that factory-charged values adhere to the specified table. If field adjustments are required, proper charge amounts and handling techniques should be strictly followed. Always refer to the charge tables for R-22 applications and consider the implications of switching to R-407C.

### Existing Unit Recovery

Recover the refrigerant from existing systems using the designated receivers and equipment. Validate that there is adequate clearance for installation and assess the compatibility of existing components with the new unit setup.

### Electrical and Operational Safety

Ensure all electrical connections comply with the relevant standards, specifically addressing the proper rotation and function of the three-phase system. Confirm operational integrity by following electrical guidelines and reviewing component specifications. The crankcase heater should remain operational during startup to prevent damage.

### Operational Protocols

Monitor the high head pressure switch. If the high head fails to acknowledge input within specified timeframes, take necessary actions to reset the system or address potential faults. Careful attention is required during initial start-up conditions for successful operation.

### Final Checks

Conduct thorough inspections of all installations, ensuring clearances, routes, and grounding are in compliance with operational requirements. Each unit should be verified for functionality prior to full operation, including checking for proper charge and component integrity.

Applying bypassing to the suction system enhances operational efficiency compared to standard suction methods. This strategy mitigates issues related to overheating by redirecting flow, ensuring that suction levels remain adequate during high-load conditions. Should suction pressure dip below a specified threshold, flow is redirected back to the suction inlet. Increased superheat levels, typically maintained between 50-60°F (10-15°C), facilitate optimal system performance. Components located downstream of the suction system should be carefully selected to maintain consistency under these higher superheat conditions.

For maintenance, access the housing and clean the cooled areas using appropriate cleaning agents. Always isolate the system before performing maintenance to ensure safety. Caution is advised when restoring power after service, as failing to do so properly can lead to insulation damage or burnout. It’s essential to address any suspected issues promptly to avoid warranty voidance.

When charging the system, ensure compliance with recovery procedures. Isolate components as necessary and follow specific instructions for handling refrigerants. Avoid releasing refrigerants into the atmosphere. Adjust the charge based on sight glass readings, and ensure that the system is functioning within optimal parameters.

For troubleshooting, common issues may include high head pressure or defective components. Check the electrical phase and relay functionality to ensure proper suction capacity. Keep an eye on superheat levels and address any discrepancies promptly to maintain system integrity.
