This section outlines safety measures related to various materials and equipment, emphasizing the importance of secure operation and adherence to guidelines regarding potential hazards. Failure to follow these instructions may lead to serious risks, including electrical hazards associated with the use of power cords and equipment. Always operate machinery with caution and never under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as these substances can impair your ability to operate safely. Consult with a physician if you are on prescribed medication.

Ensure that workspaces are clear of hazards and that equipment is used according to manufacturer specifications. Avoid operating machinery near children, and keep all safety guards in place. Be aware of the safety requirements detailed in this manual and comply with relevant OSHA and local regulations.

Never attempt to cut hazardous materials or those treated with harmful substances. Properly manage dust during cleanup—do not use compressed air, which merely redistributes the dust.

If any switch is damaged or the equipment is showing signs of malfunction, refrain from use and seek repair from authorized service centers. Always use protective gear, including eye protection and suitable clothing, to prevent injury.

Maintain a well-organized workspace to avoid accidents. Equip yourself with a fire extinguisher near the work area, and ensure proper grounding of electrical equipment to prevent shocks. Pay close attention to the assembly and operation of machinery to prevent injuries or damage.

Remember to review the technical specifications and adhere strictly to operational guidelines. This will ensure safe and efficient use of equipment, reducing the risk of accidents in the workplace.

For operation, ensure the protective equipment is worn, including ANSI-compliant eye and ear protection. Be cautious around moving parts to prevent accidental injury. The machine must be properly grounded before use, following the specifications outlined in the technical chapter.

Ensure all screws are securely fastened, especially when adjusting the tilt and height of the sawhead assembly. After any adjustments, confirm that the assembly is stabilized and then press the ON/OFF switch to operate the saw, holding it firmly in place.

Proper alignment and secure tightening of rotating and locking mechanisms are crucial to ensure safety and performance. Always handle the saw safely and avoid reaching over or under it during operation. 

For detailed adjustments related to cutting depth and assembly configuration, consult the product manual. Always be aware of your surroundings and maintain a safe working distance from the blade.

**DANGER**: Servicing should only be performed by trained and authorized personnel. Use proper protective gear to avoid injury from metal shavings or other debris.
