To minimize the risk of fire, electric shock, or injury, always turn off the power switch before performing any maintenance or service. Avoid using the device as a toy. Do not connect to an outlet that exceeds the cord's rated capacity. Ensure the power cord is free from damage and clear of any heated surfaces. Be cautious around open flames or hot objects. Ensure the appliance is cool before servicing, and turn off the power switch when disconnecting or connecting components.
