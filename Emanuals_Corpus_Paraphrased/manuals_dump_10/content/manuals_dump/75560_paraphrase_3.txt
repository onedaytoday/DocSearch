Stay safe and enjoy your cooking experience!

To ensure proper air circulation, make sure that cookware can move freely within the cooking cavity. This allows heat to evenly distribute around the food. When serving, it's essential to arrange food items so they are adequately spaced, either at the top or arranged enough that the light can reach them, ensuring thorough cooking. Use appropriate cookware to maintain food quality and safety while heating. Always cover food when necessary to enhance heat retention, and remember to clean cookware after use to avoid buildup.

For optimal cooking, select the appropriate heat setting on the control panel, which includes options like HI (high), MED (medium), and LO (low). If you need to adjust the cooking temperature, you can do so by touching the respective setting on the control panel until the corresponding indicator light remains steady. Preheating should precede the cooking process, taking into account the type of food being prepared.

When searing, ensure your cookware is adequately preheated, typically until the surface is red-hot. Monitor the food closely to achieve the desired doneness, adjusting based on thickness and preparation time. Avoid covering the cookware while searing, as this can trap grease and raise the fire risk.

When utilizing the self-cleaning feature, ensure that the area is well-ventilated. Do not attempt to force or manipulate the self-cleaning mechanism while it's in operation, as this can cause damage and safety hazards. Self-cleaning uses high temperatures to break down residues. Ensure that any components that cannot withstand high heat, such as fragile decorative parts, are handled appropriately.

For maintenance of the cooktop components, clean spills and residues immediately, following the included instructions for specific cleaning materials and methods. Ensure that no substances enter any gas orifice openings. Regularly check and clean the heads and grates, which can often go in the dishwasher, to maintain functionality and cleanliness.

When cleaning, be aware that not using the recommended products may damage surfaces and affect cooking performance. Always allow items to cool before cleaning, and carefully scrub surfaces to avoid scratching. Follow specific guidelines for maintaining the integrity of the appliance while ensuring it remains hygienic.

### Rephrased Text:

To properly engage the bearings at the front of the chassis, listen for a click indicating the bearings are seated correctly. If you hear this click, it confirms the bearings are in place. Please ensure to turn off the appliance before servicing; doing so while in "Self-Clean" mode could lead to serious injury or death.

When performing maintenance, ensure that the glass shield covering the light is always in position during oven operation. If you need to remove the cover, grip it approximately one inch from the back and use both hands to remove it while securely holding the screws in place. Follow the proper instructions for replacing the cover.

**Important Note:** Make sure the oven is cool before you begin cleaning. Use leather gloves for protection.

**Common Issues:** The display may show an F11 error or other lights. Check for potential causes, such as improper installation or clearance issues. If the indicators persist, press the STOP/CLEAR button to reset.

For cleaning, ensure that all connections are secure and the supply is turned on. Refer to the cleaning instructions for guidance.

Self-cleaning may also require adjustments based on various factors, such as the type of food used. Allow the appliance enough time to cool before reopening after self-cleaning. If the meat curls or cooks unevenly, proper placement and clearance are essential.
