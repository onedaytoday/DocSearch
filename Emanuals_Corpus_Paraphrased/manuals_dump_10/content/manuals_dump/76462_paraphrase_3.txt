### Water Heater Technical Overview

**Water Heater Capacity and Specifications**  
The hourly capacity of the water heater is expressed in thousands of water column (WC) units. This information is provided solely as a reference. Ensure a proper water supply for the unit's operation, which can be affected by various environmental factors, including combustion prevention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of different chemicals.

**Water Treatment Protocols**  
Water treatment may vary from soft to moderately hard, allowing for effective flushing. Proper setup includes a water heater shutoff mechanism. The optional cold water treatment system needs to be installed for optimal functionality.

**Installation Guidelines**  
Take care to ensure appropriate pitch for drainage and insulation when connecting to the water heater supply. **Caution**: Avoid adding any valves to the PVC system to maintain clearance and adhere to manufacturer guidelines.

**Operational Notes**  
For combined water and heating applications, a flow switch is recommended to monitor the flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM). The system should not exceed 85W. If higher temperatures are reached, precautions against scalding must be implemented. Be sure to install a backflow prevention device.

**Remote Connection**  
To connect the remote cord to the unit, ensure correct wiring alignment, specifically for the 120VAC circulating pump. Always inspect for potential electrical faults or malfunctions before operation.

**Installation Components**  
Key connections include:  
- Condensate drain  
- Hot water outlet  
- Cold water inlet  
- Gas inlet  
- Wiring thoroughway for electrical components  

Ensure all components are installed according to the specifications provided in the technical manual. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may lead to equipment malfunction or safety hazards.
