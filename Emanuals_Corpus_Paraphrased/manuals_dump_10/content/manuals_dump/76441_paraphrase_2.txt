### Guidelines for Washing and Drying Household Items

When washing the items listed below, it’s essential to sort them by type and condition, including tablecloths, tea towels, bath towels, and aprons. Pay special attention to any items with screws or buttons that may be damaged. Colorfast items should be washed separately, as white fabrics can bleed when mixed with colors. Items with ribbons require special treatment, and bleach should be used cautiously, with all bleach products stored out of reach. 

For wool items, use the appropriate washing conditions to prevent damage. Light-colored fabrics must be kept separate from darker ones to avoid attracting lint and prevent excessive wrinkling. 

Wash heavy items like whites and colored fabrics together when possible. Stick to the guidelines for washing temperatures, as dictated by EEC regulations, and utilize prewash settings for heavily soiled items. The appliance should indicate its operational status clearly to avoid issues.

For drying, synthetic materials require lower heat settings to prevent damage. Household items like towels and bathrobes can typically be dried on higher heat, whereas delicates should be cooled or air-dried. The use of fabric conditioners can help maintain the integrity of fabrics; ensure you follow the manufacturer's instructions.

When handling laundry symbols, be aware of recommended conditions for washing, drying, and ironing. Chlorine bleach can be used selectively, and care must be taken with other cleaning agents. 

If you encounter any functionality issues or errors during operation, disconnect from electricity and refer to the provided troubleshooting guide. The appliance may require cleaning or adjustments for optimal performance. For additional assistance, contact customer service or refer to supporting online resources.
