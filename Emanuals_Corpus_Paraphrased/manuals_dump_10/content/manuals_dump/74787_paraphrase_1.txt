The ventilation of this unit is critical for heat management and sunlight exposure. Proper placement allows food to remain fresh and reduces spoilage. The following guidelines specify which foods should be stored in specific locations to optimize preservation. Certain items, like glass bottles, can burst under high temperatures, so care should be taken not to overcrowd them or allow them to come in contact with hot surfaces.

Ensure that the area around food storage is free from obstructions to facilitate air circulation. Different types of food, including meat and vegetables, require distinct storage methods—such as airtight containers or polyethylene wrap—to maintain freshness. Cleanliness is also vital; all items, including bottles, must be thoroughly sanitized to prevent contamination.

When using the appliance, disconnect from the power supply before performing any maintenance. Follow instructions carefully to ensure correct placement of shelves, as improper installation can affect performance. The internal temperature settings should be monitored to maintain appropriate conditions, particularly for items stored below 0°C.

Important safety notes include ensuring that access to the appliance is not hindered and that children are kept away from potentially dangerous items. Additionally, compliance with legal regulations on recycling and appliance maintenance is necessary to ensure safety and efficiency.
