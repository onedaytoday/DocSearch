**IMPORTANT: READ THIS OWNER'S MANUAL AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE USING YOUR SNOW THROWER**

Familiarize yourself with the layout and controls of your snow thrower as described in this manual. Key components, such as the spark plug, ignition key, choke control, throttle, engine control, recoil starter handle, power cord plug, and primer are typically located on the engine, but their actual positions may differ depending on your specific model.

**Safety Compliance:**  
Your snow thrower meets the A.N.S.I. safety standards. Always ensure that the area is clear of children and pets during operation. When adjusting the throttle, be cautious not to place hands near moving parts to avoid injury.

**Operating Instructions:**

1. **Traction Drive Control:**  
   Release the traction control for movement. Adjust the throttle to control engine speed and operation modes, with options for FAST, SLOW, or STOP.

2. **Engine Oil Management:**  
   Before starting, check the engine oil level. The machine is shipped with oil, but you should ensure levels are adequate. Change the oil as necessary, following the guidelines in the maintenance section.

3. **Fuel Management:**  
   Use fresh, clean gasoline and consider adding fuel stabilizer for long-term storage. The fuel shut-off valve is located underneath the thrower; ensure it is open for operation.

4. **Starter Functionality:**  
   For cold starts, refer to the section on starting procedures, including the use of the electric starter or recoil starter. Avoid operating with the throttle set to full during the start.

5. **Discharge Control:**  
   Adjust the discharge chute to control the snow direction and distance. Higher positions result in longer throw distances.

6. **Self-Propelling Functionality:**  
   Utilize the traction control lever to move forward or backward. Ensure that the ground clearance is adjusted appropriately to prevent damage to the thrower or the work surface.

7. **Skid Plate Adjustment:**  
   The skid plates can be adjusted to vary ground clearance. Consult the lubrication chart for maintenance and adjustment recommendations.

8. **Post-Operation Care:**  
   After use, clean the unit thoroughly and perform necessary checks to ensure it is ready for the next operation. 

**Warning:**  
When handling the snow thrower, practice caution to avoid accidents that may result in injury or property damage. Always adhere to manufacturer guidelines. 

**Lubrication and Maintenance Recommendations:**  
Regular maintenance is crucial for reliable performance. Follow the provided lubrication chart and schedule services at least once a season to minimize wear and extend the appliance's life. Use OEM parts for any replacements to ensure optimal performance and compliance with warranty conditions.

### V-Belts and Wear Hours of Operation

To maintain optimal performance, it's essential to monitor the V-belts and the hours of operation. Refer to the Service section to accurately remove the belt cover. Only use OEM components with the thrower. The auger gear case should be serviced according to factory specifications. Do not apply grease if the traction drive system is involved. Be cautious with the shafts and the friction wheel during servicing.

### Engine Lubrication

Use high-quality oil rated at API service SF-SJ, selecting an SAE grade suitable for expected operating temperatures (e.g., 5W30 or 10W30). Note that oil viscosity may change at temperatures below 32°F. Change the engine oil every 50 hours or at least once per season, ensuring the crankcase is secure. 

### Maintenance and Wheel Removal

For maintenance, refer to the relevant Service section. Wheels should be securely fastened and disconnected before removal. Ensure the area around the wheels is clean, and perform maintenance on the thrower with the wheels slowly rotated. Always inspect the muffler and spark plug at the start of each season or after a specified number of operating hours.

### Adjustments and Performance

Pay close attention to the snow thrower's height, skid plates, and scraper bar settings as outlined in the Service section. If shear bolts become damaged, replace them immediately to avoid further issues. Follow proper procedures and keep safety precautions in mind during maintenance.

### Assembly and Repairs

When reassembling, ensure all components, including the traction drive belt and engine pulley, are seated properly. If encumbrances arise during reassembly, ensure parts are clear of debris. Make sure to fasten all screws securely for safety.

### Winter Preparation and Cleaning

Before winter storage, thoroughly clean the thrower, removing any grease accumulation, and inspect the engine and fuel system. Ensure the carburetor is functioning properly to avoid performance issues when the season resumes. 

### Troubleshooting

If issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting section for causes and corrections. Common problems may involve the throttle or traction components, requiring inspection or adjustments as needed. 

### Adjustments and Clearing

For effective operation, adjust the snow thrower's clearance settings according to detailed procedures in the Service section. Ensure that all components, including the traction belt and auger belt, are correctly positioned and functioning. 

### Final Notes

It’s crucial to perform regular checks and maintenance to extend the lifespan and efficiency of your snow thrower, adhering strictly to OEM guidelines and specified operational practices.
