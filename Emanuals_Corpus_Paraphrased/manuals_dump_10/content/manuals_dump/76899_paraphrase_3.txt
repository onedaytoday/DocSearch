To ensure a successful and accurate installation, please review the following instructions carefully before proceeding. Verify that your installation adheres to local plumbing, electrical, and other relevant codes. When installing components, note that it is standard practice to ground electrical equipment—such as telephones and computers—to plumbing lines. This grounding may occur within the building or externally. However, this practice can lead to electrical feedback affecting the fountain, resulting in electrolytic reactions that might impart a metallic taste or elevate the metal content in the water. This issue is preventable by using the specified materials. Any drain fittings supplied should be made of plastic to electrically isolate the fountain from the building plumbing.

All maintenance should be conducted by authorized personnel. Installers should take note of the following: the composite back panel (EDFPVR217C) is essential for the rough-in process (98409C). A washer is recommended to minimize potential damage during installation; noting that mounting bolts and washers are not included. The specific mounting holes must have adequate wall support (blocking) for proper fountain stabilization.

The optimum location for the water supply is via unplated copper tubing, with recommended locations also noted for the waste outlet. Make sure to turn the water supply on thoroughly and check for leaks before finalizing the installation. Avoid soldering directly onto tubes that are inserted into the strainer, as this may damage the O-rings. Ensure that the water supply pressure does not exceed the specified limits or fall below what is warranted; otherwise, the warranty may be void. 

Regular maintenance using a soft cloth or non-abrasive cleaners will enhance the lifetime of the unit. When cleaning, ensure all residue is thoroughly wiped away, and avoid using harsh solvents that could damage the finish.
