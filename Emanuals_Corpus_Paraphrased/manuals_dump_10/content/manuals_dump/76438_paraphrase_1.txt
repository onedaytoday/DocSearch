To manage the washing process, utilize the designated buttons to select your preferred options. When reducing the wash cycle, the focus should be on selecting the lowest settings, especially when dealing with synthetics and other materials. Follow the sorting guidelines and washing instructions closely: separate items into categories such as whites, colors, synthetics, towels, tablecloths, and various types of shirts. 

For optimal results, ensure that new colored items are washed separately to avoid color transfer to white fabrics. Additionally, treat stains before washing with a suitable cleaner or bleach, specifically designed for white or fast-colored materials. 

When selecting washing temperatures, use a maximum of 60°C for better cleaning, with appropriate additives when needed, while being cautious about overloading the washer. Consult the provided charts for recommended settings for various materials and ensure that water supply information is obtained from the appropriate authority.

Pay attention: some items, particularly synthetics, require special handling, including careful drying to prevent damage or fire hazards. Check drying settings and ensure they're aligned with the types of materials being processed. For items like bathrobes and towels, specific drying cycles may be recommended.

To maintain the washer-dryer, regularly clean the lint filters and hose as per the instructions to avoid clogging. Disconnect the appliance from the power supply before cleaning and ensure proper cooling. Always follow the specific steps for safely draining water from the machine, particularly in emergency situations.

If any alert symbols are displayed, such as E10 or E20, indicating potential malfunctions, refer to the troubleshooting guide. Address issues promptly by redistributing clothes to ensure a balanced load and maintaining proper washing temperatures to improve efficiency.
