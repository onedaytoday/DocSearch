### Overview of the Bridge Cooking System

The Bridge includes a front panel for cooking operations, which can accommodate various cookware types. Each section of the Bridge operates independently when cooking, allowing for optimal heat management. When using cookware, ensure it is correctly positioned to facilitate effective heating; rotate the cookware clockwise or counterclockwise as needed. 

### Cooking Operations

During cooking, adjust the heat settings appropriately. Utilizing the ESEC function allows for higher temperature settings to achieve even cooking results. Once the cooking is complete, switch the heat to OFF. The indicator will illuminate to signify that heating is disabled. Always allow the cookware to cool sufficiently to avoid burns.

### Warming Function

The warming feature is ideal for keeping pre-cooked foods, like stews or breads, at optimal temperatures. It is recommended to cover food items when using this function to retain heat and moisture. Ensure that the cookware is compatible with the warming feature, and keep the space clean.

### Cookware Compatibility

Different types of cookware impact cooking performance. Use the illustrated guidelines to select suitable cookware. For instance, aluminum is prone to scratching, copper heats quickly, stainless steel is efficient, and cast iron holds heat well. Avoid using porcelain-enamel metal and glass cookware due to their susceptibility to scratches and thermal shock.

### Control Panel Instructions

Before using the oven, review the instructions related to each function, including:

- **Self-Cleaning:** Duration settings for cleaning cycles.
- **Cooking Functions:** Settings for baking and broiling temperatures ranging from 170°F to 550°F.
- **Timer Features:** Options for continuous operation and delay settings.

### Clock Settings

To set the clock, follow the provided instructions. If there is a power interruption, the clock will display "PF." Press "CLO" to reset and adjust the hour.

### Operation Features

The timer and cleaning functions can operate silently as needed. If you encounter any operational sounds, adjust the settings via the control panel. 

### Final Notes

Ensure to follow the cleaning and maintenance guidelines provided, as well as adhere to the recommended cooking times and temperatures to achieve the best results.

**BAKE and BAKE TIME Overview** 

The BAKE and BAKE TIME functions allow for precise control over cooking settings. To begin, select your desired temperature and press the "BAKE" button. The display will show the current settings, and after pressing "TIMED," you can specify the cooking duration, which can range from minutes to multiple hours. Once cooking starts, an alert will sound when the time is complete. Be cautious to avoid foodborne illnesses by adhering to proper cooking times and temperatures, particularly for meats.

**Setting Instructions** 

To use the BAKE settings, adjust the temperature to 350°F and load the racks with food. Activate the system by pressing the "BAKE" and "TIMED" buttons. If the cooking time exceeds one hour, ensure to follow the guidelines in the user manual for effective operation.

**Handling High Temperatures** 

While the oven can achieve temperatures of up to 550°F, preheating is crucial. Always maintain a safe distance from flames and have extinguishing means at hand in case of fire. Avoid covering with foil or using grease-laden items incorrectly to prevent flare-ups.

**Convection Cooking Features** 

The convection cooking feature ensures even heat distribution, enhancing cooking efficiency. When using CONV BAKE, it’s recommended to set the temperature to approximately 325°F to accommodate for convection effects. Regular checks are advised during the cooking cycle to ensure food quality.

**Roasting with Convection** 

When using CONV ROAST, it’s important that the food is positioned correctly to allow for even heat circulation. Always ensure the meat is elevated properly to prevent grease contact with heating elements, enhancing browning and flavor.

**Favorite Setting** 

To save preferred cooking configurations, use the FAVORITE SETTING function. Record your desired settings, and quickly access them by pressing the designated button. Ensure you follow the prompts on the display for optimal results.

**Sabbath Mode Instructions** 

For Sabbath mode, once activated, the system will maintain temperature without manually adjusting. It's crucial to start at a recommended temperature, and the oven will automatically revert to a preset state. The light indicators will provide guidance to ensure proper functionality throughout usage.

**Warming Features** 

The warming feature can be used independently of cooking modes, but should not be activated during self-cleaning cycles. Install the warming shield securely to maintain safety and effective operation. Always ensure all components are properly seated to avoid malfunctions.
