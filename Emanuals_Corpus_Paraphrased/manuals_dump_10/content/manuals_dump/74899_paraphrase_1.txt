**HSG Overview**

The HSG offers various types of food preparation options including CYCLE modes for tomatoes, fresh onions, and various bread types such as French, consistently enabling efficient cooking processes. It features a white, non-microwave, compact design ideal for traditional cooking methods. 

Internal tests based on C C conditions demonstrate that HSG significantly enhances food service efficiency. The HSG unit utilizes an LED countdown timer for cooking, facilitating food wraps with efficient stuffing options. 

The cooking phase begins promptly, with a toasting time measured in seconds. The performance is improved through a combination of non-stick heating plates. 

The top plate is designed with non-stick properties to ensure optimal food holding during the cooking phase. It activates upon closure, and its height adjustment allows seamless operation, ensuring even cooking. 

HSG's innovative design combines direct heating with microwave capabilities, delivering high-quality results and perfectly toasted food in minimal time. The non-stick coating on the heating plates simplifies cleaning and maintenance.
