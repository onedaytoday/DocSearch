**GN Chillers Overview:**

GN Chillers facilitate the rapid cooling of cooked food from +90°C to +3°C, significantly minimizing bacterial growth. This process enables the holding of food at +3°C without compromising quality. 

**Operating Modes:**
- The chillers offer various operating modes, including Soft Chilling (down to 2°C) and standard chilling (down to 20°C). Each cooling cycle can be initiated with the insertion of food. 
- Additionally, features such as built-in UV lights (available as an accessory), defrosting, and countdown displays for service and status updates enhance usability. Each operating mode's performance is monitored, and any abnormal termination is recorded to ensure compliance with HACCP standards. 

**Performance:**
- The chilling capability enables food to be brought down from +90°C to +3°C efficiently. 

**Construction and Finishing:**
- Built with AISI stainless steel and a high-density polyurethane insulation free of HCFC. The design includes rounded corners and conforms to ISO standards, ensuring ease of cleaning and maintenance. The unit is protected with an IP20 rating.

**Technical Data:**
- Chiller productivity is aligned with NF and UK regulations, including built-in cooling, thermostats, and thermometers. Dimensions and configurations are available in various GN types.

**Included Accessories:**
- Features include a 3-sensor probe for chilling/freezing applications, single sensor probes, HACCP advanced connectivity, a pair of AISI stainless steel grids, and optional wheels for mobility. Additional components such as tray racks, worktops, and printers for HACCP documentation are also included.

**Installation:**
