### Installation Instructions
**Safety Precautions:**  
When installing this exhaust system, adhere to all necessary safety precautions. Use jack stands when working under the truck, block the tires, and wear safety glasses and gloves. Avoid working with hot pipes!  

**Suggested Tools:**
- 15mm Socket Wrench
- WD-40

- Hacksaw

**Installation Guidelines:**
- Ensure there is sufficient clearance around all pipes from rubber brake lines, tires, shocks, fuel lines, etc.
- Torque clamps to the specified foot-pounds.

#### To Remove Stock Exhaust:
1. Cut the stock exhaust system just in front of the muffler, leaving all rubber grommets on the hangers.
2. Apply WD-40 to facilitate the removal of the exhaust and hangers.

#### Installation Steps:
1. Attach the Head Pipe to the existing stock front pipe and secure it with Clamp F (do not tighten yet).
2. Install the Muffler onto the Head Pipe, ensuring the louvers face the converter. Use a jack stand to support the Muffler and secure it with Clamp G (do not tighten yet).
3. Ensure the Muffler inlet is facing into the louvers.
4. Place Band Clamp H onto the Muffler, then insert the welded hanger into the rubber grommet, and tighten Band Clamp using Hardware Kit I.
5. Install the Overaxle Tail Pipe into the Muffler and secure it using Clamp G (do not tighten yet).
6. Connect the Turnout Pipe to the Tailpipe and secure with Clamp G (do not tighten yet).
7. Adjust the Exit Pipe to the appropriate angle for your truck and insert the welded hanger into the grommet.
8. Install the Stainless Steel Tip and clamp down securely.

#### Final Steps:
Once everything is positioned correctly, firmly tighten all bolts and clamps.
