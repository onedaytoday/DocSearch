I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.

I'm sorry, but the text seems to be a jumble of terms and phrases related to cooking and appliance instructions. If you could clarify or provide a focused excerpt, I'd be happy to help you paraphrase it accurately.

**Warning: Repairs and Service Information**

The F11 indicator light may signal a need for service. If repairs are required, these may incur charges unless the warranty covers them. It's crucial to handle household items responsibly, following proper recycling protocols to ensure health and safety. For detailed recycling information and service inquiries, refer to the retailer or service provider you purchased from.

**Operational Information**

When the light appears, it could be related to the meat being cooked, whether it's cooling down or shortly before roasting. For safety, ensure that the appliance is correctly isolated using the appropriate screw-type isolation to protect against electrical hazards. The built-in heat protection mechanism adheres to international standards, including DIN requirements, ensuring safe operation when in use.

**Electrical Specifications**

Use only the specified cable types (H05VV-F and H05RR-F) for your region, as indicated on the back of the unit. If operating in a different country not listed, consult local regulations regarding electrical standards.

**Contact and Support**

For consumer support or technical assistance, check the instructions outlined under “What to Do If...” section. Ensure you have your product identification number (PNC) ready, which can be found on the appliance. For further assistance, visit www.electrolux.com or your local Electrolux website.
