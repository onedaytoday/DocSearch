To disconnect the power supply from the appliance, locate the switch at the rear. However, frost may accumulate in some areas. It is important to address this when the frost thickness increases, as it can affect the food stored inside. To resolve this, switch off the appliance and adjust the thermostat to the appropriate setting for defrosting, following the manufacturer’s guidelines.

Warning! Do not attempt defrosting if the appliance exhibits any malfunctions. Refer to the “Initial” section for troubleshooting guidance.

Ensure the appliance operates efficiently. If food cools too quickly or does not defrost properly, consult the specific “Location” section. Follow the maintenance guidelines in the “Cleaning” section to prevent buildup or breakdown and to maintain optimal performance.

Check all components thoroughly, including shelves and trays, and carry out regular cleanings. When using cleaning agents, ensure they are compatible with the appliance to avoid damage. If any issues persist, contact AEG Service Force for professional repairs, as inexperienced handling can lead to further complications.

Additionally, allow food to cool to the correct temperatures before storage, and avoid covering it with excessive layers that retain heat. Always use compliant cleaning products for any maintenance task.
