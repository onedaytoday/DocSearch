The cooking switch adjusts based on the type and quantity of food being prepared. The functionality for cooking can be modified without changing the selected options. After initiating the cooking switch, it applies the necessary heat to the food, which can include functions like frying, steaming, warming, and browning. It's important to clean any burns and residue from the cooking surface. Use a damp cloth for cleaning, ensuring the appliance is cool before attempting to wipe it down. If necessary, specialized scrapers and cleaners should be utilized for tough spots. 

For rectifying issues that might affect performance, please adhere strictly to the provided instructions. Unauthorized repairs might void the warranty, so if service is needed, contact an authorized service provider directly. Ensure that the cooking switch is turned off properly; prolonged activation can cause the appliance to overheat. If the cooking function remains operational beyond safety guidelines, follow the troubleshooting process outlined in the safety chapter.
