## SANTO KG Operating Instructions

Dear Customer,

Please refer to these operating instructions for essential information regarding the operation and functionality of your appliance. Pay special attention to the warnings indicated, as these highlight critical safety information. You can find detailed explanations in the section titled “Technical Terminology.” 

These instructions also cover troubleshooting for common malfunctions. If any issues arise, consult the section “What to Do If,” or contact AEG Service Force for assistance.

### Appliance Location

Ensure the appliance is positioned correctly, allowing for adequate ventilation, as improper placement can affect its performance. Avoid areas exposed to direct sunlight or other heat sources.

The appliance must be earthed (grounded) as indicated by the rating plate. The plug includes colored wires: usually, green/yellow is for earth, blue for neutral, and brown for live. Ensure proper connections to avoid hazards.

### Installation Instructions

When installing the appliance, maintain a clearance of at least the specified amount at the top and back. Proper clearance will enhance airflow and prevent excessive frost buildup.

### Safety Warnings

Do not allow children to access the appliance without supervision to prevent potential harm. Ensure bottles are not stored in the freezer, as they may burst.

### Operation and Maintenance

When starting the appliance for the first time, allow it to run for a specified period before use. For frozen foods, utilize the FROSTMATIC function to accelerate freezing processes. This feature can be activated and deactivated easily and should be monitored.

### Troubleshooting

If the appliance emits warning tones or indicators, address these promptly as they signal operational issues. For ongoing problems, contact AEG Service Force for expert assistance.

Follow these guidelines to ensure safe and efficient operation of your SANTO KG appliance.

### Appliance Operation and Maintenance

#### Powering the Appliance
To turn off the appliance, press and hold the ON/OFF button for several seconds until it powers down. Ensure nothing obstructs the door to prevent unintended closure, which could lead to issues such as mold growth. For proper maintenance, follow the cleaning and defrosting guidelines to maintain optimal performance. 

#### Accessories
Adjust the shelves in the appliance to fit different bottle sizes by twisting the corners forward. Position bottles by tilting them slightly, ensuring the bottleneck is oriented towards the front for ease of access.

#### Fresh Food Compartment
The Fresh Food section maintains higher temperatures than the freezer, making it suitable for storing meats and other perishable items. Ensure the front cover is pulled forward to create an effective seal, which prevents cross-contamination between stored items.

#### Storing Perishables
When arranging food, avoid overcrowding shelves, as this can inhibit air circulation and lead to spoilage. To monitor temperatures accurately, use a thermometer, checking it overnight for proper cooling, ideally at or below 5°C.

#### Food Safety
Cover food items to prevent contamination. Use appropriate wraps or containers, particularly for fresh produce, as uncovered items may spoil faster due to exposure.

#### Warning:
Exceeding the manufacturer's recommended storage limits can compromise food safety. Ensure that frozen items are stored under the indicated weight limits to avoid thawing.

#### Normal Operation Sounds
It's normal to hear sounds during operation, such as whirring from the cooling mechanism or thermal cycles adjusting the temperature. Ensure the appliance is placed away from heat sources to avoid obstruction of airflow.

#### Cleaning and Maintenance
Before attempting any cleaning or maintenance, disconnect the appliance from the power supply. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that contain harsh chemicals, as they can damage surfaces or present safety hazards. Thoroughly clean the appliance, especially around the coils, to enhance efficiency.

#### Troubleshooting
Should the appliance fail to cool adequately or produce unusual noises, consult the troubleshooting section. Common issues include blown fuses or improper settings. Contact customer service for persistent problems or repairs.

#### Regulatory Compliance
The appliance complies with EU safety and electromagnetic compatibility regulations. Local standards (GSG, VBG, VDE) ensure safe and efficient operation in household environments.

#### Warranty Information
The appliance is covered for a specified period against manufacturing defects, providing free service for covered issues. For additional support or service inquiries, contact Service Force or refer to the corresponding contact number for guidance.
