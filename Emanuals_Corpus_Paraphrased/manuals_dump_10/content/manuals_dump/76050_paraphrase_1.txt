When using the vacuum for the first time, connect the hose and ensure it clicks securely into place. Always turn the vacuum off when adjusting the height or performing maintenance.

### GETTING THE BEST RESULTS

Periodically empty the dust container when it reaches the maximum fill line. Clean the cyclonic filter as necessary. 

**REPLACING FILTERS**
Replace the Exhaust Filter (EL012B) and Motor Filter periodically or when they become dirty. Use only Electrolux original filters to ensure compatibility and effectiveness.

### CLEANING THE HOSE
If there are blockages, disconnect the hose and allow it to cool before clearing. Clean the hose to prevent obstructions from affecting performance.

### BELT REPLACEMENT (EL097)
Replace the belt if it becomes worn or damaged. Ensure the vacuum is unplugged before attempting this and follow the instructions carefully.
