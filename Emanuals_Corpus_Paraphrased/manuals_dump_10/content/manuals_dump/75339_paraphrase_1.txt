### Tips for Using the Oven

**Oven Shelves and Placement**  
When organizing the oven shelves, count them from the top downwards. Position food items in the center of the shelves to promote even cooking and maximize airflow around the dish. This not only enhances cooking performance but also minimizes the need for cleaning.

**Main Oven Usage**  
Ensure the oven is preheated to the recommended temperature for optimal cooking. Without preheating, achieving the desired cooking temperature may take longer. When using the oven, refer to the provided cooking chart to determine the appropriate temperatures and shelf positions for different types of food.

**Batch Baking Notes**  
When preparing multiple items, such as cakes, it's essential to arrange them properly on the shelves for even heat distribution. Follow the temperature guidelines closely, usually within a range of 20-25°C adjustment, to ensure successful results without overcooking.

**Defrosting Feature**  
Utilize the defrost function for frozen foods, especially those sensitive to temperature variation like cakes with frosting. This function allows for safe and effective thawing, accelerating the process, particularly for thinner cuts of meat. Ensure to cook food immediately after defrosting to prevent bacterial growth.

**Cleaning Guidelines**  
Prior to cleaning, ensure the oven is turned off and cooled down. Use recommended cleaning materials and avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the oven’s finish. Clean the exterior with a soft cloth and appropriate cleaners, and take care not to use abrasive materials that could scratch surfaces.

**Removing and Replacing Components**  
For maintenance, shelves and wirework runners can be easily removed for cleaning. Ensure all parts are securely reattached after maintenance. 

**Light Bulb Replacement**  
When replacing the main oven light bulb, ensure the power is disconnected and the oven is cool. Use a screwdriver where necessary to access the bulb cover. Follow similar procedures for the top oven light bulb.

If issues arise, refer to the troubleshooting section or contact Service Force for assistance. Always ensure that the oven is properly set and functions are being followed as per the user manual to avoid misoperation.
