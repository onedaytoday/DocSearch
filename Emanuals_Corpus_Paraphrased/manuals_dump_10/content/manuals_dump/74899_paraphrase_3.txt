**HSG Overview**

HSG employs a CYCLE type approach, specifically tailored for tomatoes, fresh ingredients with onions, and various bread types, including French and round loaves. The system is designed to operate without a microwave, focusing on traditional cooking methods. Internal evaluations show it as a core component in enhancing the efficiency of cooking processes.

HSG is dedicated to improving food service efficiency, incorporating an LED countdown for cooking times, optimizing wraps, and maintaining high performance during food preparation. The cooking elements consist of dual heating plates that facilitate easy operation and consistent results.

The top plate features a non-stick coating that enables efficient cooking while retaining the height, ensuring even heating across dishes. The combination of microwave functionality with traditional heating methods promises perfectly toasted food in less time.

This system guarantees higher food quality, with items remaining warm and delicious until served. Cleanup is simplified through the inclusion of a dedicated scraper tool.
