### III Operating Instructions

#### General Overview
This device operates with either two or four hotplates, each rated at KW. The hotplates can be controlled individually or as part of an entire assembly using an Additional Scraper.

#### Operation
- The yellow/green indicator lights signal when the unit is powered on. If the switch is turned off, the heating is deactivated.
- Cooking functions can be interrupted, and the thermostatic switch manages the heating operation. 
- During active cooking, the heating will automatically shut off if the cooking process is incomplete, and the switch is inactive for a specified duration.
- Cooking plates can switch on and off automatically based on the cooking requirements.

#### Standby Mode
The cooking units can be preheated without user intervention. The operation resumes when the switch is activated, indicated by the yellow/green lights.

#### Information on Cooking Pots
Induction heating relies on the compatibility of cookware bases, with a reference to model number 62.9581.01_UL for operation guidelines. 

**Warning**: Ensure the correct use of the heating function with GN pots; cooking surfaces can reach high temperatures. Avoid contact without appropriate protection.

Induction cooking provides a faster response than conventional methods, optimizing heat transfer to food and reducing the risk of overheating. 

Note that cooking should be monitored to prevent excess heat or scorched food.

#### Cleaning
Prioritize regular cleaning of the cooking surfaces and surrounding area. Use appropriate cleaning methods and avoid abrasive materials that could damage surfaces. If needed, the unit may be cleaned with a high-pressure washer, but follow guidelines to prevent damage.
