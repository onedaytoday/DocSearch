### Care Cleaning Tips: Cleaning and Precautions

When cleaning, utilize a cloth to wipe down surfaces and tracks. For dishwasher items, ensure thorough cleaning to prevent food buildup. If you are moving during short vacations, it is advisable to turn off appliances and properly disconnect food supplies. Make sure to clean the appliance thoroughly.

If using a handcart, be cautious not to scratch surfaces while maneuvering it. For best results, allow surfaces to dry before cleaning and use appropriate household cleaners or a smooth cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals like ammonia on surfaces.

### Replacing Light Bulbs

Both fresh food compartments and the exterior may have specific lights that need their covers removed for bulb replacement. Always exercise caution—wear protective gear when dealing with electrical components and ensure the power is off. Unscrew the appropriate light covers to access the bulbs.

### Refrigerator Warranty

This warranty protects consumers and is applicable through authorized servicers. The consumer is responsible for one year from the date of purchase, covering sealed parts. However, limitations include exclusions for consequential or incidental damages stemming from warranty breaches. Normal maintenance responsibilities fall on the customer, as does any damage due to misuse or external factors.

For service needs, refer to the warranty documentation, as additional rights may exist. This warranty applies only within the United States and may not cover modifications made by non-authorized personnel.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

Before contacting service, check for simple issues, such as ensuring the cooling system is turned on and that power is properly connected. Clean any obstructions that may affect performance.

**Common Issues:** 

- **Excessive Cold:** If food is freezing, adjust the temperature settings and allow time for stabilization.
- **Warm Temperatures:** Check the temperature settings and ensure doors are closing completely.
- **Water/Moisture Issues:** Examine for clogs or leaks in the water supply. 

Whenever you experience trouble with ice production, confirm that the ice maker and water supply are functioning appropriately and are not clogged. 

If lights are not illuminating, check the light switch and ensure the bulbs are correctly installed. 

For further troubleshooting or service, consult your manual or authorized service personnel.
