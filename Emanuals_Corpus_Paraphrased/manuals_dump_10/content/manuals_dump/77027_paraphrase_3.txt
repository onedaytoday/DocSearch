**Inductance Specifications and Connections**

Inductance refers to the property attributed to coils within the system, primarily affecting phase connections in both DC and AC supply configurations. The DC inductance is specified for the current (Ir) in Amperes (A) and should be distributed across each phase, adhering to the specifications set for AC supply.

For optimal performance, the AC supply voltage should range from 135V to 270V, with a recommended current exceeding 20A for 3U amplifiers. The connection scheme for the motor's DBP MC chassis requires twisted and shielded wiring to minimize RFI.

### Chassis Grounding Options

2. **Isolated with Ground**: Here, the amplifier's heat sink is grounded. 
3. **Internally Connected to Ground**: The metal frame of the amplifier and any corresponding pins are internally linked to the common ground. 

**Note:** DC power terminals become interconnected when only a single phase is utilized or when there's a need to amplify shunt currents.

### Connection Notes for External Components

- DC power connections should be configured based on the supply phase and shunt current specifications. 
- Ensure shielding is correctly attached only at the computer end for RS232 and RS485 communication lines. 

**Hall Sensor and Communication Setup**: 
When connecting Hall sensors, ensure the pairs are shielded properly. For RS232 and RS485 communication setups, additional precautions including grounding and shielding at the correct endpoints are necessary.

### Encoder Connections

For differential encoders that require a +5V supply, employ J1 pin connections; a +15V supply mandates the use of a different pin. Shielding must always connect back either to the designated pins or to the chassis ground.

### Pulsed Input Configurations

Connections for pulse and direction inputs must ensure shielding is correctly connected to prevent interference.

### Amplifier Setup Procedures 

Use DIP switches to configure the amplifier settings suited to the operational requirements. Ensure to follow the specified guidelines for RS232 and RS485, depending on your configuration needs.

### Adjusting Electrical Parameters

For high-frequency operations, utilize specific components to reduce output interference. Adjust the phase reference using appropriately selected capacitors and resistors.
