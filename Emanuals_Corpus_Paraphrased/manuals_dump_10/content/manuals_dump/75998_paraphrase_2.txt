**RECOIL STARTER HANDLE BREAKAGE IN TILLERS**

Ensure the tiller is off the ground to allow for correct rotation. Perform a TINE OPERATION CHECK following the maintenance guidelines. **Caution:** Familiarize yourself with throttle settings (FAST and IDLE). Maintain the tiller slightly above ground level. If ground conditions or tiller regulation fail, these settings must be addressed. Regular checks will prevent issues such as debris wrapping around components. 

**SPARK PLUG AND THROTTLE CONTROL**

Ensure all controls are functioning correctly. Find your service dates on the MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE, which should be filled in as maintenance is completed. Conduct regular inspections and clean the cartridge frequently if using the tiller under heavy conditions.

**LUBRICATION GUIDELINES**

Follow the LUBRICATION CHART, using recommended oils like SAE 10W-30 or 5W-30. Check oil levels before each use and every 20 hours of operation. Replace the oil based on guidance provided in the maintenance section.

**AIR CLEANER MAINTENANCE**

Inspect and clean the air cleaner regularly. Ensure that screws are secure and not obstructed by debris.

**HANDLE HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT**

The handle can be adjusted from its factory setting to a higher position for comfort. Securely fasten all adjusting screws after modification.

**TINE OPERATION CHECK**

Test for proper tine operation and clearance during use. 

**ENGINE ADJUSTMENTS**

For carburetor adjustments, do not modify the engine governor. If adjustments are necessary, consult an authorized service center.

**STORAGE PRECAUTIONS**

To prevent gum deposits in critical fuel system components during storage, ensure the engine is empty of fuel and take appropriate measures against moisture. Always allow the engine to cool completely before covering.
