**Software Chapter: Advanced Exporting to PSP**

To export PlayStation footage to the PSP, ensure the aspect ratio of the footage is correctly adjusted. Begin by selecting the recorded footage and then choose the PSP option. Change the file format to M4V50970.MP4 for compatibility with the PSP. Note that both the .MP4 file and its accompanying .THM file must be present on the PSP.

Connect the PSP to a USB port and navigate through the interface to access the Memory Stick section. There, you should locate the folder labeled MP_ROOT, which contains the 100MNV01 folder. Confirm that the .MP4 and .THM files are properly placed within the 100MNV01 directory. Once everything is set, unmount the Memory Stick, highlighting the USB option, and follow the prompts on the PSP to initiate playback.

**Exporting Video Files**

To export footage from a 5G device, highlight the desired recording and convert it to MPEG-4 for playlist compatibility.
