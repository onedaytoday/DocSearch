Upon completion, adjust the brightness settings accordingly. Follow the outlined instructions for sorting laundry. Organize items into categories: whites, colors, and synthetics. Wash whites and colored items together only if necessary. New colored garments should be laundered first to prevent color transfer. Use a suitable treatment for stubborn stains, allowing items to soak overnight if needed. 

For stain removal, use bleach for whites and colors, but be cautious and adhere to specific instructions. Select washing temperatures, typically 60°C or higher for heavily soiled items, and adjust settings based on fabric type. Follow guidelines regarding pre-washing and fabric category, ensuring not to overload the machine and to select appropriate wash cycles such as "Cottons/Linen" or "Synthetics" as needed.

Utilize features tailored for delicate items or handwashing as appropriate. Ensure components are clean and maintained regularly. In case of emergencies or troubleshooting, refer to guidance for disconnecting power, inspecting hoses, or resolving issues related to drainage or spin cycles.

For technical specifications, note water capacity ratings according to different fabric types as indicated. Ensure adherence to user manual instructions for proper setup and function, while maintaining safety and efficiency throughout the washing process.

Positioning and handling of the hose for the coating application must be approached with caution. When dealing with a cooker or a coal-burning stove, ensure that the area is insulated from temperatures below 0°C. Be mindful of the hose's integrity, as improper connections can lead to failures. The water supply hose must be securely connected, and any necessary adjustments should be made according to specifications. 

If the hose is too short, it may need to be replaced with one specifically designed for this application; consult with an authorized service provider for guidance. Always adhere to the "Technical Water-Stop" section regarding maintenance and safety protocols. If any damage occurs, disconnect and notify the service department immediately.

When attaching to branches, ensure the connection is elevated enough from the ground to avoid obstructions. The hose must remain properly ventilated, ensuring compliance with required specifications. 

Warnings related to grounding and proper electrical connections must be strictly followed to ensure safety. In the event of damage, refer to service authorities regarding proper disposal and recycling methods. Follow the manufacturer's guidelines to maintain health and safety standards. For detailed recycling information, please consult the service center or the point of purchase. 

Typically, no pre-washing is necessary, provided that the items are correctly loaded and handled in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
