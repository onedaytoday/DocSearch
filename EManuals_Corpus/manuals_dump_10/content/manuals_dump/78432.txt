BOOK 0958-B The following strictly to YOU AS THE OWNER OR OPERATOR OF FINCOR EQUIPMENT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE THE USERS OF THIS EQUIPMENT TRAINED IN ITS OPERATIONS AND WARNED OF ANY POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF SERIOUS INJURY. THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE INSTALLED, OPERATED, ADJUSTED, AND SERVICED ONLY BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL FAMILIAR WITH THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE EQUIPMENT AND THE HAZARDS INVOLVED INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. FAILURE TO OBSERVE THIS WARNING CAN RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY, LOSS OF LIFE, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE REQUIRES THAT AN AC LINE FUSED DISCONNECT OR CIRCUIT BREAKER BE PROVIDED IN THE AC INPUT POWER LINES TO THE CONTROLLER. THIS DISCONNECT MUST BE LOCATED WITHIN SIGHT OF THE CONTROLLER. DO NOT OPERATE THE CONTROLLER UNTIL THIS CODE REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN MET. THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT IS AT AC LINE VOLTAGE WHENEVER AC POWER IS CONNECTED TO THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT. CONTACT WITH AN ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR INSIDE THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT OR AC LINE DISCONNECT CAN CAUSE ELECTRIC SHOCK RESULTING IN PERSONAL INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE. BE SURE ALL AC POWER IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT BEFORE TOUCHING ANY COMPONENT, WIRING, TERMINAL, OR ELECTRICAL CONNECTION IN THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT. ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES WHEN WORKING ON THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT. DO NOT REMOVE OR INSERT CIRCUIT BOARDS, WIRES, OR CABLES WHILE AC POWER IS APPLIED TO THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT. FAILURE TO OBSERVE THIS WARNING CAN CAUSE DRIVE DAMAGE AND OR PERSONAL INJURY. ALL DRIVE EQUIPMENT ENCLOSURES, MOTOR FRAMES, AND REMOTE OPERATOR STATIONS MUST BE CONNECTED TO AN UNBROKEN COMMON GROUND CONDUCTOR. AN UNBROKEN GROUNDING CONDUCTOR MUST BE RUN FROM THE COMMON GROUND CONDUCTOR TO GROUNDING ELECTRODE BURIED IN THE EARTH OR ATTACHED TO PLANT GROUND. REFER TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CODE AND LOCAL CODES FOR GROUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THE ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDING THE DRIVE EQUIPMENT MUST BE FREE OF COMBUSTIVE VAPORS, CHEMICAL FUMES, OIL VAPOR, AND ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTIVE OR CORROSIVE MATERIALS. SOLID-STATE DEVICES IN THE CONTROLLER CAN BE DESTROYED OR DAMAGED BY STATIC ELECTRICITY. THEREFORE, PERSONNEL WORKING NEAR THESE STATICSENSITIVE DEVICES MUST BE APPROPRIATELY GROUNDED. WARNING
