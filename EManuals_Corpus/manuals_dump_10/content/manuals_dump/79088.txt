This information about the following: IGMP Section B.1 and Functions Section B.2 Detecting Routers Section B.3 B.1 IGMP OVERVIEW (IGMP) routers. This Networks SmartSwitches when operating the 802.1Q to the IGMP The information from the IGMP and created to the of only to those stations that IGMP from routers. that back to the router.

Supported and Functions B.2 SUPPORTED FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS The following the and functions when using IGMP: when the switch operating the 802.1Q Supports and routers the VLAN. Supports router the forwarding the of to which the More the performance. Supports IGMP and only. that directly connected to routers through routing IGMP or VLAN, and NOTE: of firmware allow the switch to to the release shipped with and to shipped with RFC Section information.
