WARNING which, death or serious injury. which, or ELECTROLUX CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OR INJURY TO PERSONS CAUSED BY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE INSTALLATION, MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS CONTAINED IN THIS SERVICE MANUAL. TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE, ELECTRICAL SHOCK, OR INJURY WHEN USING YOUR REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER, FOLLOW BASIC SAFETY PRECAUTIONS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE OPERATING THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER. BEFORE PERFORMING ANY TYPE OF SERVICE OR INSTALLATION, MAKE SURE THAT ELECTRIC POWER TO THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER IS DISCONNECTED. TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPLOSION OR FIRE, DO NOT STORE OR USE COMBUSTIBLE, FLAMMABLE, OR EXPLOSIVE LIQUIDS OR VAPORS (SUCH AS GASOLINE) INSIDE OR IN THE VICINITY OF THIS OR ANY OTHER APPLIANCE. THIS APPLIANCE IS EQUIPPED WITH THREE-PRONG GROUNDING PLUG FOR PROTECTION AGAINST POSSIBLE ELECTRIC SHOCK HAZARDS. PLUG IT ONLY INTO DEDICATED, GROUNDED ELECTRICAL OUTLET. WHEN ONLY STANDARD TWO-PRONG ELECTRICAL OUTLET IS AVAILABLE, THE CUSTOMER MUST HAVE IT REPLACED WITH DEDICATED, PROPERLY GROUNDED THREE-PRONG ELECTRICAL OUTLET BEFORE USING THIS APPLIANCE. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, CUT OR REMOVE THE THIRD (GROUND) PRONG FROM THE POWER CORD. DO NOT USE AN ADAPTER PLUG. DO NOT USE AN EXTENSION CORD. DO NOT USE POWER CORD THAT IS FRAYED OR DAMAGED. THE USE OF GROUND FAULT INTERRUPTER (GFI) IS NOT RECOMMENDED. DO NOT INSTALL OR USE DAMAGED APPLIANCE. IF YOU RECEIVE DAMAGED APPLIANCE, IMMEDIATELY CONTACT YOUR DEALER OR BUILDER. DO NOT USE THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER UNTIL IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY INSTALLED BY QUALIFIED INSTALLER ACCORDING TO THESE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS. THE INSTALLER MUST SHOW THE CUSTOMER THE LOCATION OF THE POWER PLUG SO THAT THEY KNOW WHERE AND HOW TO DISCONNECT POWER TO THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER. DO NOT INSTALL, REPAIR, OR REPLACE ANY PART OF THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER UNLESS SPECIFICALLY RECOMMENDED IN THE LITERATURE ACCOMPANYING IT. QUALIFIED SERVICE TECHNICIAN SHOULD PERFORM ALL OTHER SERVICE.
DESTROY CARTON, PLASTIC BAGS, AND ANY EXTERIOR WRAPPING MATERIAL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER IS UNPACKED. CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER USE THESE ITEMS FOR PLAY. CARTONS COVERED WITH RUGS, BEDSPREADS, PLASTIC SHEETS OR STRETCH WRAP MAY BECOME AIR TIGHT CHAMBERS AND CAN QUICKLY CAUSE SUFFOCATION. CHILD MIGHT SUFFOCATE IF HE CRAWLS INTO THE FREEZER TO HIDE OR PLAY. REMOVE THE DOOR/LID OF THE REFRIGERATOR/FREEZER WHEN NOT IN USE, EVEN IF YOU PLAN TO DISCARD THE FREEZER. MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE LAWS REQUIRING YOU TO TAKE THIS SAFETY PRECAUTION. REMOVE OR DISCARD ANY SPACERS USED TO SECURE THE SHELVES DURING SHIPPING. SMALL OBJECTS ARE CHOKE HAZARD TO CHILDREN. CHILD ENTRAPMENT AND SUFFOCATION ARE NOT PROBLEMS OF THE PAST. JUNKED OR ABANDONED REFRIGERATORS OR FREEZERS ARE STILL DANGEROUS EVEN IF THEY WILL SIT FOR JUST FEW DAYS. IF YOU ARE GETTING RID OF YOUR OLD REFRIGERATOR OR FREEZER, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW TO HELP PREVENT ACCIDENTS: REMOVE THE DOOR/LID. LEAVE SHELVES IN PLACE SO CHILDREN MAY NOT EASILY CLIMB INSIDE. HAVE THE REFRIGERANT REMOVED BY QUALIFIED TECHNICIAN. Information
