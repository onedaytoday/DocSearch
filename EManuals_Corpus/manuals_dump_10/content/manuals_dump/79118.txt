ABOUT IP MULTICAST GROUP MANAGEMENT The (IGMP) and their immediately neighboring switch The allow to inform its switch that to to group. switch its they to traffic. If there than switch the LAN IP multicasting, of these elected and the responsibility of the LAN Based the membership information learned from IGMP, switch which to to each of its At switch this information, with routing to IP the IGMP the IP service concerned with forwarding from the switch to directly attached subnetwork or LAN This switch IP the IGMP and IGMP IP switches and IP to learn IP and actively IGMP to IP The of IP to switched performance to those containing or switch instead of to the (VLAN). IGMP NSA
IGMP Summary to IGMP and the actively IGMP to learn locations of switches and within each VLAN. that IGMP neither IP Since IGMP concerned with the of IP subnetworks, IP switch IP to routed subnetworks. IGMP CONFIGURATION SUMMARY Multicasting to such as or streaming to establish with each It broadcasts its service to the and that to the with their switch/router. Although this approach reduces the overhead the switch/router through to that to the that to this service. The switch IGMP to attached who to service. The the IP this service and that to that group.
