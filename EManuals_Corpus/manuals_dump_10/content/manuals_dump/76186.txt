INSTALLING THE DUCTWORK NOTE THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL FOLLOW THE PLANS MADE ON PAGE START AT THE EXTERIOR AND RUN THE DUCT BACK TO THE RANGE HOOD. FOR BEST PERFORMANCE OF YOUR RANGE HOOD, USE THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE DUCT RUN AND MINI- MUM NUMBER OF ELBOWS. NEVER VENT RANGE HOOD INTO AN ATTIC SPACE BECAUSE BUILDUP OF GREASE WILL BECOME FIRE HAZARD. USE ONLY METAL DUCTWORK (DO NOT USE PLASTIC DUCT). ASSEMBLE SECURELY SO THAT IN CASE OF GREASE FIRE ON THE RANGE, THE FIRE WILL BE CON- TAINED INSIDE METAL DUCT WORK.
